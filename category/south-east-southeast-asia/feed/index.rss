										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Asian Art Gallery Review 7 &amp; 8</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2131" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?resize=990%2C654&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="654" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this gallery, you will achieve an understanding of <strong>art and architecture of West, Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia.</strong> How is art and architecture evidence of cross-cultural connections and influences? How are religious beliefs and practices represented within art and architecture? How does patronage influence artistic and architectural production?</p>
<p>You will explore the cultural distinction of Asia</p>
<ul>
<li>the religions of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism</li>
<li>the influence of these religions and social hierarchy on art and architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Gallery Objectives</strong></h5>
<p>Different cultural and religious values are reflected in the art and architecture of a culture and dictate how sacred space is used. The beliefs of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism necessitated different characteristics in the sacred architecture and art. This is evidenced in how deities are represented in the art and the architectural designs. Trade transmitted both religious and artistic influence throughout Asia, and political entities utilized art and architecture to represent religious support of leadership.</p>
<h4><strong>Monuments of Faith</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>distinguish architectural elements of mosques</li>
<li>recognize the connection between religious needs and religious function of architecture</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sacred Connections</strong></h5>
<p>Think about your community and the buildings it contains. Can you visualize political structures like city hall or the courthouse? Do they contain common features like columns or large, ascending staircases? Think about places of worship in your community. Do they contain common features?</p>
<p>The use of architecture for religious needs is a common thread that connects cultures, despite time or geography. There are elements that are specific to religion or culture, like the <strong>ark in Jewish synagogues</strong>, <strong>the cross in Christian cathedrals</strong>, and the <strong>mihrab</strong> in Muslim <strong>mosques</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The definition of Islam is &#8220;submission to the one God,&#8221; and its followers are referred to as Muslim, or &#8220;those who submit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Islam rose in Arabia early in the 7th century and eventually brought the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Its extensive advance was not only the result of military conquests, but also of the nature of the Islamic faith and its appeal to millions of converts. This advance resulted in altering sacred architecture in regions that were conquered to accommodate the needs of Muslim worshipers.</p>
<p>The art and architecture of the Muslims represents the different techniques and ideas from diverse cultures that converted to Islam, and the impact of Islam was reflected in the art and architecture of other cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Art and architecture can have a sacred function.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Pillars of Islam</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2247 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=599%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="599" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?w=599&amp;ssl=1 599w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2247" class="wp-caption-text">Koran Manuscript</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are <strong>commonalities between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity</strong>. Islam incorporates Old Testament teachings, ethical standards, and rejection of idol worship. <strong>All three beliefs segment after the Old Testament.</strong></p>
<p>Muslims worship without a hierarchy of rabbis, priests, or saints acting as intercessors. Muhammad was believed to be God’s messenger and is considered the Final Prophet in a line that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He began to receive revelations of God through the archangel Gabriel and was persecuted by Meccan leaders who disagreed with his message.</p>
<p>In 622 C.E., he fled the city of Mecca for a desert oasis called Medina, or “City of the Prophet.” This exodus was called the <em>hijra</em>, or emigration, and is considered the beginning of the Islamic religion. Eight years later, Muhammad returned to Mecca with an army of 10,000, took control of the city, and converted the population to Islam.</p>
<p>Muhammad destroyed all the idols and preserved the <em>Kaaba</em>, the symbolic center of the Islamic world. He died in Medina in 632 C.E.</p>
<p>Muslims live according to the <em>Koran</em>, Islam’s sacred book.</p>
<p>This book was arranged by the Muslim ruler, Uthman, and contains the collected revelations communicated through Muhammad during his lifetime. It has 114 surahs, or chapters, divided into verses.</p>
<p>The duties of the Islamic faith include the <strong>Five Pillars of Islam</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Shahadah</strong>: Assert that <strong>there is only one God</strong> and that Muhammad is his messenger.</p>
<p><strong>Salat</strong>: Pray five times a day facing Mecca (where <em>The Kaaba</em> is located).</p>
<p><strong>Zakah</strong>: Give <strong>alms</strong> to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>Sawm</strong>: Fast during the month of <strong>Ramadan</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hajj</strong>: Make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime (if possible).</p>
<p>The Five Pillars guide Muslims in the commitment and practice of Islam, and the reward for the faithful is paradise. Islam also features a union of religious and secular authority, joining religious and political leadership in one ruler. This practice continued after Muhammad in the form of caliphs, or successors, who took charge of the community’s political and spiritual matters.</p>
<h5><strong>Is the Center of the World a Cube?</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> is a cubical, textile-draped shrine said to have been built for God by Abraham and Ishmael. It had been inundated with pagan idols before Muhammad conquered Mecca. After the battle at Mecca, Muhammad removed the idols, preserved the structure, and dedicated it to Allah.</p>
<figure id="attachment_789" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-789" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-789" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?resize=700%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="465" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?w=337&amp;ssl=1 337w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-789" class="wp-caption-text">The Kaaba<br />© Kazuyoshi Nomachi/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stripping of the idols resulted in the concept of <strong>aniconism</strong><strong>,</strong> avoiding figural imagery and graven images, in art. <strong>Islamic art that is created for religious purposes</strong> does not contain figural imagery. Islamic art and architecture take on both sacred and secular function. <strong>Aniconism</strong> has, therefore, resulted in variances in the imagery of sacred and secular art and architecture.</p>
<p>Religious architecture includes both mosques and commemorative monuments, but <strong>in comparison to religious buildings from Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity</strong>, there is an evident lack of <strong>graven images</strong>. Manuscripts or objects containing sacred text can contain <strong>calligraphy</strong>, <strong>illumination</strong>, or <strong>geometric and plant decoration</strong>, but cannot have the representation of figures. Due to the religious purpose of the Islamic commemorative monuments, <strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong><em>,</em> there is no figural imagery.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> represents the center of the Islamic world, is the place where all Muslim prayer is directed, and is the destination of the Islamic pilgrimage, or hajj.</p>
<figure id="attachment_788" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-788" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-788" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?resize=700%2C463&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="463" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?w=440&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-788" class="wp-caption-text">Gathering at the Kaaba<br />© ALI JAREKJI/Reuters/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>This monument is covered with a silk curtain that is <strong>embroidered with calligraphy</strong> in gold and silver-wrapped thread. The use of expensive materials is often a representation of paradise in Muslim art and architecture. The curtain lacks figural imagery and is replaced annually during the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Every year during the month of pilgrimage, Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca. This occurs from the eighth to the twelfth of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar, and as it is a <strong>lunar calendar</strong>, it is 11 days shorter than the common <strong>Gregorian calendar</strong> used as standard today.</p>
<p>The worshipers move around, or <strong>circumambulate</strong>, the <em>Kaaba</em> seven times in a counterclockwise direction. This act is believed to show the unity of the believers in worship of Allah. Worshipers rise from the lowest of the seven steps, or stages, of the soul to the highest.</p>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been modified and expanded extensively throughout its history to fix damage that had occurred, enlarge the area, or replace the cover. The last alterations took place in the 1950s by the Saudi Arabian government to accommodate the large number of pilgrims who come on the Hajj.</p>
<h5><strong>The <em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-793" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-793" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=700%2C704&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="704" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-793" class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Rock<br />© SEF/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is the first great Islamic monument and the third most holy site in Islam. It was commissioned as an architectural tribute to the triumph of Islam by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik between 687 and 692 C.E. It is built on the Noble Enclosure or “The Foundation Stone,” a rock that is the site of the first and second Jewish temples.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-794" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-and-Exterior-Drwaing.jpg?resize=600%2C553&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="553" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The site is also significant as it is the presumed location of Adam’s grave, the place where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac, and the location where Muhammad began his journey to heaven. The coming of a new religion to Jerusalem was marked by building on a site holy to both the Jewish and Christian faiths. The <strong><em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong> is the first architectural display of Islam’s belief: that it completed the prophecies of both Judaism and Christianity and supersedes them. It is a statement of the idea that Islam is the completion of the worshiper’s connection with God.</p>
<figure id="attachment_795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-795" style="width: 683px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-795" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?resize=683%2C860&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="683" height="860" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-795" class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Rock<br />© Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>With a central-plan structure, the<em> <strong>Dome of the Rock</strong></em> imitates the form of early Christian and Byzantine <strong>martyria</strong>. The 75-foot double-shelled dome is made of wood, and then covered with gold, a valuable material used as a representation of paradise. It is supported by alternating piers and columns. This creates <strong>concentric</strong> aisles that allow worshipers to circumambulate the rock in the center, again demonstrating the oneness of the Muslims in worship.</p>
<h4><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>summarize the impact of Islamic art on outlying cultures and regions</li>
<li>explain the role of calligraphy in religious artworks, luxury objects, and architecture</li>
<li>compare Islamic architecture with architecture of other cultures <strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Calligraphy was a prominent art form, particularly in Islamic art in West Asia where beautiful forms were created to transmit sacred texts. Calligraphy is found on <strong>architecture, decorative arts objects</strong>, and <strong>ceramic tiles</strong>, as well as in <strong>manuscripts</strong> written on paper, cloth, or vellum.</p>

<figure id="attachment_2253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253" style="width: 999px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2253" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?resize=990%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="483" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2253" class="wp-caption-text">A close up of the inscription</figcaption></figure>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an <strong>inscription of poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</p></blockquote>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The fourth line provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>The Reverence of Calligraphy in Islamic Art </strong></h5>
<p>Islamic culture values poetry and oral tradition. They believed that the message of God was revealed through the prophet Muhammad, so words are the priority of the religion. Unlike Christianity it does not have a use for iconic images.</p>
<p>The beautiful writings of calligraphy were considered the highest art. It was used not only to spread the words of the Qur’an but also decorative images as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: &#8220;The first thing God created was the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Islamic calligraphy includes </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Arabic Calligraphy, Ottoman, and Persian calligraphy</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">. It developed from two major styles: </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Kufic</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">, the oldest form of Arabic script and </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Naskh</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">, traditionally used for more informal purposes. It is important to note that there are variations on each style, as well as regional differences.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Folio from a Qur’an</em></strong> was created with ink, color, and gold on parchment paper. The paper was costly and made from sheep or goat skin.  The work measures 12 inches wide.</p>
<figure id="attachment_820" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-820" style="width: 986px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-820" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=986%2C570&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="986" height="570" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-820" class="wp-caption-text">Folio from a Qur’an<br />© The Pierpont Morgan Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The word folio simply means a page in a book. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p><strong>The page uses calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used is known as Kufic. This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>
<p>Early Korans would only feature three to five lines per page to meet the need for visual clarity, as there were times one Koran would be shared by several readers. Since the copies were hand-produced and were finely crafted, they were expensive and rare. <strong>The red marks</strong> function as pronunciation guides, and the chapter title, page numbers, geometric designs, and vegetal imagery are embedded in the golden ornament in the middle of the page. <strong>Gold is significant, as it is symbolic of paradise in Islamic culture.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Luxury Objects</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2513" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?resize=460%2C697&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="460" height="697" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?w=248&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Court of Gayumars, folio from Shah Tahmasp’s Shahnama. Sultan Muhammad. c. 1522–1525 C.E. Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calligraphy was used to embellish luxury objects</strong>. These smaller-scale luxury arts feature an immense collection of manuscript paintings, ceramics, and metalwork and are examples of both the range and quality of Islamic skill. <em>The Shahnama, or Book of King</em>s, is a Persian national epic poem by Firdawsi (904–1025 C.E.) that recounts the history of Iran from creation until the Muslim conquest. This poem is paired with manuscript paintings in the Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp. There are 258 illustrations by many artists in this book that was presented as a gift to Selim II, who commissioned the Selimiye Mosque.</p>
<p>This specific page, <em><strong>Court of Gayumars</strong></em>, was painted by Sultan Muhammad. A non-religious work, it uses figural imagery to depict Gayumars, the legendary first king of Iran, as he presides over his court from his mountain throne.</p>
<p>The image is placed off-center as if it is floating, and delicate figures of the court, animals, trees, rocks, and sky populate a lush landscape. This enhances the sense of lightness and airiness, giving the illustration a heavenly appearance and a reference to paradise. The animals, trees, and rocks support the text in the Shahnama, which states that wild beasts became instantly tame in the presence of the Gayumars.</p>
<p>The poem, in calligraphy, encompasses the top and bottom of the painting. The manuscript became part of a private collection in the West and was eventually split and sold as individual pages. This is evidence of the Western collector’s view that each page was an independent work of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic metalwork</strong>, which encompassed <strong>metal plaques, vessels, arms, armor, and sculpture, was considered one of the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world</strong>, extending well beyond West Asia. Islamic metalsmiths would ornament the surface of vessels with scrolls, interlacing designs, <strong>calligraphic inscriptions</strong>, and human and animal figures. As these vessels were not religious in nature, the aniconism of the Islamic religion does not apply.</p>
<p>The<strong> Basin</strong> by Muhammad ibn al-Zain is made of brass and inlaid with gold and silver. The practice of inlaid brass work was common from the mid-12th century forward due to a shortage of silver. Basins similar to this were used for washing hands at official political ceremonies, and this specific basin may have been fashioned for a Mamluk sultan for use in his palace.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2514" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=675%2C452&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="675" height="452" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=1024%2C686&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=1536%2C1029&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?w=1770&amp;ssl=1 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Basin (Baptistère de St. Louis). Muhammad ibn al-Zain. c. 1320–1340 C.E. Brass inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The skill of the work denotes the generosity of the patron, but the lack of a specific inscription means there is no evidence of whom the basin was created for. The artist, Muhammad ibn al-Zain, signed the basin six times. This was uncommon, and the exact reason al-Zain did this is unknown.</p>
<p>The surface is decorated with three bands whose backgrounds feature stylized vegetal forms of inlaid silver. The upper and lower bands depict running animals, and the center band shows Mamluk hunters and Mongol enemies. Both the inside and underside are decorated with figures and animals. The basin was acquired by the French and referred to as the <strong><em>Baptistère de St. Louis</em></strong>. It was used in the baptismal rites of newborns of the French royal family as early as the 17th century and is an example of both the status and widespread influence of Islamic art.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mughals–a Little Islamic… And a Little European too</strong></h5>
<p>The Mughals were the most successful of the many Islamic groups that established themselves in India beginning in the 12th century, and they presided over a cosmopolitan court with refined tastes. Foreign ambassadors and merchants often visited, and the emperors admired Persian art and sought out European luxury goods. This resulted in <strong>artworks and architecture that had both European and Islamic influence,</strong> an outcome of cross-fertilization.</p>
<p>Jahangir was the fourth Mughal emperor and ruled from 1605 until 1627. Jahangir commissioned a painting from the <strong><em>artist Bichitr</em></strong>, who portrayed his patron in both a European and Islamic style. The painting Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings features a scroll-like border with intricate vegetal patterns.</p>
<p>Islamic influence is seen in the intricate vegetal patterns framing the painting, and <strong>the calligraphy is in two pairs of cartouches both at the top and the bottom of the painting</strong>. The intricate vegetal patterns are continued in the lower portion of the painting. Jahangir is shown sitting on top of an hourglass throne, with four figures to the left. The top figure is a Muslim Sufi Shaykh, or mystic saint, who is being presented with a book from Jahangir, below him is a Turkish sultan, then a full European style portrait of King James I of England, and then below him a representation of the artist himself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-844" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=500%2C729&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="729" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em>. Bichitr. c. 1620 C.E. Watercolor, gold, and ink on paper.</strong></p>
<p>The allegorical style of the painting is evidence of the European influence of style. The tower of figures represents the social hierarchy in the emperor’s eyes.</p>
<p>The inscription “although to all appearances kings stand before him, Jahangir looks inwardly toward the dervishes” attests that the emperor looks to Islamic holy men for guidance.</p>
<p>By placing himself in the lowest place in the tower, <strong>Bichitr </strong>recognizes that he is lowest in status. He also portrays himself giving Jahangir a gift, displaying his reverence for the emperor. The hourglass symbolizes that Jahangir sits above time. The side profile view of the faces is evidence of European influence, but King James I of England’s face is looking directly at the painter, as it was copied from a painting given as a gift to Jahangir. Jahangir’s head is encircled in a radiant halo that combines a sun and a white crescent moon. This <strong>halo is a visual display of Jahangir’s title of honor</strong> and evidence of European and Byzantine influence. This, in addition to the scrollwork and calligraphy, is also evidence of Islam influence, specifically from the Shahnama.</p>
<h5><strong>Calligraphy and Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>In the Buddhism of India, writing was always encouraged not only by monks and nuns, but the regular, everyday person who was Buddhist. This involved handwriting Buddhist scripture.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhist Calligraphy </strong>refers to the lettering art that draws subject from Buddhist literature. The artists are Buddhists and secular individuals.</p>
<p>Then there is<strong> calligraphy of Buddhists. </strong>This form of calligraphy does not necessarily present words from Buddhism.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chinese calligraphy</strong>, more than half of the famous works from ancient China are based on Buddhist subjects or created by Buddhists. These works can be classified into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manuscripts</li>
<li>Inscriptions</li>
<li>Engraving Scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>It is further classified by author:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calligraphy of Buddhists</li>
<li>Calligraphy of Secular Artists</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Manuscripts</strong></h5>
<p>Long before printing presses, <strong>Chinese Buddhist masters</strong> copied all scriptures into manuscripts by hand. The work starts with a title, main section containing spaces between paragraphs and a postscript. The result is simplistic yet elegant.</p>
<h5><strong>Inscriptions</strong></h5>
<p>Inscriptions were also part of Buddhist calligraphy. One area of prominence was grottoes art in famous Buddhist temple grottoes.</p>
<p>Such Chinese Buddhist temple grottoes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yungang</li>
<li>Longmen</li>
<li>Dunhuang</li>
</ul>
<p>These inscriptions were used for models for later calligraphers.</p>
<p>Other inscriptions can be found in mountains and stupas.</p>
<h5><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Calligraphic style of the Buddhist sect known as Zen in Japan and Cha’an in China included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bokuseki</strong>, or ink trace in Japanese.</li>
<li>Chinese <strong>(Wade-Giles romanization) Mo-chi, </strong>or (Pinyin)<strong>Moji</strong>,</li>
</ul>
<p>These forms of calligraphy were a direct result of Cha’an Buddhism crossing into Japan during the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century. During the Moromachi period (1338-1573) <strong>Bokuseki</strong> was a part of a distinguished monks accomplishments. Monks admired for this include:  Musō Soseki (1275–1351), Sesson Yūbai (1290–1346), and Tesshū Tokusai (fl. 1342–66).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ani-Aniconism</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>recognize the representation of the divine in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>contrast sacred spaces related to Hinduism and Buddhism</li>
<li>examine religious burial practices in South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Hindu Art and Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Similar to calligraphy in Islam, <strong>mantras are written ornately on Hindu art and architecture</strong>. The first symbol in the Tibetan mantra pictured is Om. As Hindus worship, mantras are recited that bring the deity into the image. Om is used at the end of a prayer as an invitation to the deity.</p>
<p>The belief that the deity is present is not taken lightly, and the image will not be removed from the temple. Individuals pray and make offerings like food, flowers, water, oil, dancing, or ritual sacrifices to the deity, supporting their belief that the deity is physically present in the image and, therefore, must be cared for.</p>

<h5><strong>Hindu Temples, Break It Down</strong></h5>
<p>From the 10th through the 14th centuries, India was largely a cluster of small kingdoms and different areas that developed highly individualized styles. The forms for temples in the north and south remained standard, although each building reflected the creator&#8217;s personal aesthetic and spiritual sensibility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2566" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?resize=598%2C794&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="598" height="794" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?w=271&amp;ssl=1 271w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Image: Shikara (tower) in a northern-style temple, carved from base to tip with colorful figures and reliefs.</strong></p>
<p>In the northern-style temple, the tower is called a <strong>shikara</strong>. It has a slightly convex shape and tapers at the top, where it is crowned by a flattened and fluted stone called an amalaka or fruit.At the very top, a finial connects the earthly realm below to the celestial above. Temples are symbolic in form, based on the mandala that symbolically connects the heavens and earth.</p>

<p><strong>The Vishnu Temple</strong> at Deogarh is one of the earliest temples in this northern style. The doorway, visible in this image, demonstrates the importance of the concept of the portal.</p>
<p>This is the passage from the ordinary world of the flesh to a place of spirit. Stepping over the threshold is a symbolic act of purification.</p>
<h5> Buddhism Iconism-Aniconism</h5>
<p>“To the first of his followers, and the tradition associated with <strong>Theravada Buddhism</strong> and figures like the great Emperor Ashoka, the Buddha was a man, not a God. He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of <strong>India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand</strong>.</p>
<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the <strong>Mahayana School</strong>, Buddha was a savior and often a god—a god concerned with man’s sorrows above all else. The Mahayana form of Buddhism is <strong>in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan</strong>. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.</p>
<p>The <strong>aniconic mode</strong> of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism</strong> (Sanchi Stupa) developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that never show the Buddha in human form. Instead, his presence was <strong>indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations</strong> as well as by his “non-image.”</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>the Chinese aniconic phase refrained from any pictorial representation</strong> and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy.</strong> The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.</p>
<p>A record left by the thirteenth-century monk Dharmasvamin of his visit to Bodh Gaya is especially interesting considering the problem of <strong>aniconism</strong>. Like earlier pilgrims to the sacred site, Dharmasvamin did not find the living Buddha at Bodh Gaya. Instead, what he described is not unlike what we see in some of the so-called aniconic reliefs, for he said that &#8220;inside the courtyard stood the empty throne of Sakyamuni . . . which was worshipped, and an eternal offering lamp was kept in front of it.”</p>

<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa Early Aniconic representations of Buddha: “the non-image”</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>At the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi 1st century CE </strong></h5>
<p>Sculptural friezes at important early Buddhist stupas like Sanchi depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the <strong>Buddha represented in aniconic form, using certain fixed symbols</strong>. On the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi the Buddha’s body is <strong>represented by the Body tree</strong>, a crowning lotus rosette on a column like structure, a stupa, the Buddha’s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).</p>
<p>Each symbol represents a pivotal event in Buddha’s life: <strong>a lotus</strong> (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, <strong>a fig tree or throne</strong> representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, <strong>a wheel, a flaming column</strong> with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and <strong>a stupa</strong> (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.  In some cases he is also represented by <strong>a pair of footprints</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>The icon (corporeal body) of the Buddha in India and China: Gandhara style</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Buddhism along the Silk Road Gandharan Buddha 2nd century</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandhara</strong> is the ancient name of a region in northwest Pakistan bounded on the west by the Hindu Kush Mountain range and to the north by the foothills of the Himalayas. In 330 B.C., Alexander the Great conquered this region and familiarized its artists with the classical Greek sculpture.</p>
<p>Starting about 50 B.C., Kushan era, the sea trade driven by monsoons increased. Thus, merchants from Rome and the Middle East passed through <strong>Gandhara</strong> on their way to Central Asia and China. Gandharan control of the high mountain passes vital to this international commerce made the region wealthy. The resulting cosmopolitan elites became some of the most powerful Buddhist patrons in all of South Asia.</p>
<p>Gandhara’s art combines <strong>(syncretism)</strong> local characteristics with elements derived from <strong>both Indian and western (Greek, Roman) cultures.</strong></p>
<p>After the 1st century C.E., with the development of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form. These new, iconic images of the Buddha were particularly popular in the region of Gandhara and in Māthura, south of New Delhi. They were depictions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, i.e. bodhisattvas. Many of the concepts characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism—the later form of Buddhism—appear to have developed in Gandhara.</p>
<p>These <strong>anthropomorphic images usher in a new phase of Buddhist art</strong> in which artists convey meaning through the <strong>depiction of special bodily marks (lakshanas) and hand gestures (mudras)</strong> of the Buddha.</p>
<p>In this anthropomorphic image of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the artist depicts Prince Siddhartha seated on a throne, surrounded by the demon Mara and his army, who attempted—unsuccessfully—to thwart Prince Siddhartha’s attainment of enlightenment. At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth, calling the earth to witness his spiritual awakening. In doing so he becomes the Buddha.</p>

<ul>
<li>the body is hidden with heavy cloak echoing a Roman toga; its sharp folds echoing Greek Parthenon draping styles form concentric curves centered on the right shoulder.</li>
<li>the face is elongated, the chin is quite prominent, and the corners of the relatively thin mouth are slightly sunken.</li>
<li>the eyes are narrow under a heavy lid, gazing downward in compassion to the world</li>
<li>the wavy Greek-like hair is gathered into a topknot symbolic of wisdom</li>
<li>a lightly incised circle, called an urna, appears between the eyes. The urna was an identifying mark of the Buddha’s divine status and ability to see beyond our realm.</li>
<li>Buddha has long earlobes that recall the heavy royal earrings he once wore</li>
<li>the second-century Bodhisattva Maitreya had a musculature markedly western/Greek</li>
</ul>
<p>The bodily attributes displayed in Buddhist sculpture varied only slightly</p>
<p>The Buddha is shown in his human shape because of his last incarnation in the human world, but particular bodily marks are witness to his transcendence of the human realm. After enlightenment, the historical prince Siddhartha Gautama acquired various marks (lakshana) that identify him as the Buddha.</p>
<p>The <strong>importance of the bodily attributes</strong> for any Buddha image in India and China can hardly be overestimated. Descriptions of these are formalized in the Buddhist canon, specifying 32 primary and 80 secondary superhuman attributes. For the most part, however, the local lists are homogenous.</p>
<p>The major bodily attributes of a Buddha are witness to his completion of awakening and are, therefore, the only adequate way to represent him in human form. The Buddha’s body is dignified, well proportioned, and extremely tall, with its slender and long limbs.  There is a top hair bump, and the hair is fashioned into tiny snail stylized curls. Another mark is the urna between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s earlobes are extended in reference to the heavy jewelry he wore previously as a prince. He wears a simple monk’s robe, in keeping with his spiritual purpose, and sits in a lotus position.</p>
<p>Fingers have all the same length, or special markings on the palms and on the soles of the feet. All parts of the Buddha’s body, even features that cannot be represented, like his voice, are determined by his being enlightened.</p>
<p>Often the face and the uncovered parts of the body were gilded, representing the light emitting from the Enlightened One’s body. His skin was said to be of a golden hue, emitting light from every single pore.</p>
<p>Other important attributes mentioned in the texts pertain to the meanings of his hands position, the mudras, which evoke ideas during Buddhist meditation or rituals:</p>
<ul>
<li>right hand over right knee (calling Earth as a witness to Enlightenment)</li>
<li>right hand held up with palm out (symbolizing giving reassurance, “no fear”)</li>
<li>hands held at chest with fingers turning invisible wheel (setting in motion the “wheel of the doctrine”—that is, preaching)</li>
<li>hands placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched palms facing upwards (“meditation mudra”)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathura was a sacred place for the followers of Jainism</strong> who sculpted their deities. The <strong>Mathura Buddhas </strong>are related to the earlier Indian yakṣa figures (male nature deity). This is a direct continuation of the old Indian art of Sanchi with few Gandharan elements facial types will establish the traits of the Buddha iconography:</p>
<ul>
<li>full of energy with broad shoulders, swelling chest</li>
<li>if standing the legs are firmly planted and spaced apart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mudras:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>left hand palm facing down in “calling earth as witness” mudra</li>
<li>often the right hand forms a mudra of “fearlessness” representing protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear; the left arm akimbo or resting on the thigh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warmer Climatic Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buddha’s torso is dressed with a transparent monk’s robe</li>
<li>a higher fluidity of the clothing</li>
<li>drapery is closely molding the body giving the illusion of nudity.</li>
<li>details tend to be less realistic, and more symbolic</li>
<li>radiant inner calm and stillness, the products of supreme wisdom</li>
<li>earlier the shaven head and the topknot of the head indicated by a tiered spiral</li>
</ul>
<p>Later Buddhas had shell-like hair curls, which became the standard representation throughout the Buddhist world. These Buddhas have ornate halos around the Buddha’s head, while in Gandharan art the aureole is plain.</p>
<ul>
<li>garments with lotus flower (symbol of purity) design</li>
<li>the presence of either the lion throne or the lotus throne.</li>
<li>the sitting Buddha images naturalistic pose with legs crossed</li>
<li>represented as powerful with broad shoulders and open eyes</li>
<li>more warmer climate adaptations: the right shoulder bare,</li>
</ul>
<p>Standing Buddhas tend to display characteristics and attitudes seen in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara:</p>
<ul>
<li>the clothing covers both shoulders, with symmetric folds</li>
<li>the left hand holds the gown of the Buddha while the other hand (Roman toga style)</li>
<li>the folds in the clothing are more typical of the Gandharan style</li>
</ul>

<p>A remarkable parallel can be drawn with the icon of Christ. The portrayal of his physical features follows the notion of a “delineation,” which places every human being into a coded system of particular features that establish a distinctive identity. The Patriarchs of the Byzantine stated that “The icon of a man is not inscribed according to nature, but according to position.” (Barber 2002). In other words, there was no doubt about what the historical, incarnated Christ “looked like,” because there was only one way in which he could have manifested physically in the world. Thus “an icon has to be seen as a living eyewitness of actual events.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<h4><strong>Natural and Spiritual</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>recognize symbolism and iconography of the natural and spiritual world in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>evaluate cross-cultural impact of religious and political themes</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>iconographic symbolism, natural motifs, and themes of human’s connection</strong> with both the <strong>natural and spirit world</strong> in <strong>Buddhism and Shindoism</strong> saturated non-religious art and reflected the continued impact from Silk Route and trade.</p>
<h5>China</h5>
<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism</strong>. Predating this are philosophies and historical texts that are based around nature and the cosmos. This later influenced Chinese Buddhism.</p>
<h5><strong>Neo-Confucianism in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Self − Qi + Li = Oneness</strong></p>
<p>Daoism and Confucianism were both prevalent ethical, philosophical, and religious systems in China when Buddhism was introduced. <strong>Neo-Confucianism merges the three philosophies</strong> and teaches that the universe consists of two interacting forces know as li, or idea, and qi, or matter, “The individual’s goal is to rid the qi of impurities through education and self-cultivation so that the li may realize its oneness with the Great Ultimate.”</p>
<h5><strong>Essence</strong></h5>
<p>Art, like monument landscape painting, expressed Neo-Confucian ideas visually. The artist’s goal was to paint the essence of the landscape, not to reproduce the appearance of it. The artist was required to understand all of the aspects of the li of the landscape and, therefore, would express the desire for the spiritual communion with nature that was the key to enlightenment.</p>

<p>In <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, Fan Kuan relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape, embracing Neo-Confucian ideas. Gaps between the tree distances function like pauses between the varying views.</p>
<p>Scale in the piece <strong>emphasizes the sense of vastness and space</strong>. The small trees and shrubs are dwarfed in light of the size of the mountain.</p>
<p>The painting, presenting universal creation in its totality, is an orderly statement reflecting the artist’s worldview. The essence of the landscape in <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, including the sense of vastness and space, supported viewers as they meditated while seeking spiritual communion with nature and, therefore, seeking enlightenment.</p>
<p>Silk was both a popular and valuable material, and it was able to be made in large pieces to support large, monument landscape paintings like <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>. At over seven feet high, the piece differs from the Japanese hand scrolls—small-scale secular paintings designed to be appreciated in private settings. These pieces differ in not only size but also subject. The hand scroll <strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> is an account of a battle, unlike the natural mountain view in <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Korea</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism came to Korea from China in the 4th century C.E. and carried with it symbolic themes of the natural and spirit world. Tombs of the Silla kingdom contained artworks representative of the wealth and power of its rulers.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Gold and jade crown</em></strong> is made of sheet gold, embossed along the edges, and is an example of the high level of skill among the artists in the Silla kingdom. This technique may have come from China.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1470" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1470" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?resize=600%2C681&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?w=298&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?resize=264%2C300&amp;ssl=1 264w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1470" class="wp-caption-text">Gold and jade crown<br />© DeA Picture Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gold rivets and wires secure the pieces of jade along the crown and horn-like projections. Jade is significant as it was both a symbol of the wealthy and elite, but it was also believed that it possessed magical qualities that could protect the dead. The projections are representative of tree and antler forms and are believed to symbolize life and supernatural power, suggesting the connection of nature to the supernatural world.</p>
<h5><strong>Japan</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>beauty of the changing seasons</strong> has always been <strong>celebrated by the people of Japan.</strong> Each season brings its own celebrations and festivals. This is also part of <strong>Shinto</strong>, Japan’s native belief system and indigenous religion. It has been preserved in and has been part of the everyday fabric of Japanese life.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine Shinto</strong> had a close relationship to the Imperial royal family and was both a religion and a state. <strong>Sect Shinto</strong> originated around the 19<sup>th</sup> century and has 13 major sects organized by the founder or systematizer. <strong>Folk Shinto</strong> is based on Japanese folk beliefs. All three are interrelate.</p>
<p><strong>Poetry and visual arts</strong> are part of Shinto. Kokinshu (A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern) is the first known works of Japanese poetry, and nature is the inspiration. Shinto paintings of the Heian period show Spring blossoms Autumnal leaves and winter scenes.</p>

<p>The work above, from the Metropolitan Museum is entitled <strong><em>Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons</em></strong>. It was painted in the late 16<sup>th</sup> century during the Momoyama period (1573-1615), in Japan. The work is a pair of six-panel folding screens with ink, color, gold, and gold leaf. The story moves from right to left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many paintings depict the <strong>transitioning of seasons</strong>. A theme in both Shinto and Buddhist art is the <strong>theme of beauty and brevity</strong>. For a more minute view of seasonal changes flowering plants and flowers become painting compositions.</p>

<p>Decorative arts were adorned in the same way. Think ceramics, lacquerware and even kimonos.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>In Japan, painting of landscape also incorporated varying techniques. In <strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong>, Ogata Korin used <strong>tarashikomi</strong>, which literally means “dripping in.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?resize=320%2C286&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="320" height="286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?resize=300%2C268&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2237" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?resize=318%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="318" height="287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Tarashikomi involves applying a second layer of paint before the first is dry. This results in a dripping form that creates fine details like ripples in water or leaves and is specifically used in <strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> to depict the tree trunks.</p>
<p>This painting, like <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape. The stream cuts through the center, giving the impression of expansion. The trees offer asymmetrical views. The white plum tree on the left is mostly outside of the screen, while the red plum tree on the right is mostly within the screen</p>
<h5>Gardens</h5>
<p><strong>Wet and dry gardens in Japan</strong> echo the connection of the natural and spirit world. They are designed to create both a sense of integration between the observer and nature and an atmosphere in which meditation can take place.</p>
<p><strong>Wet gardens</strong> contain stones, vegetation, and water, while <strong>dry gardens contain</strong> stones, vegetation, and representations of water. Water and stone represent opposites that complement and complete each other in Buddhist symbolism. The walled dry gardens at <strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> consist of 15 arranged stones on a raked bed of white sand, which is representative of water and purity.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2068" style="width: 572px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2068" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=572%2C381&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="572" height="381" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2068" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, wet garden<br />© John Lander Photography</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stones are carefully arranged in five groups so that the entire garden cannot be seen from the porch, and only 14 stones can be viewed from any other angle. The gardens were viewed as puzzles, or lessons, to promote study and meditation. Those who come to the garden to meditate believe that they will be able to see the 15th stone when they reach enlightenment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2202" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?resize=587%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="587" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?w=349&amp;ssl=1 349w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Scholars disagree about the stones’ meanings: some theorize that the stones represent islands in a stream or possibly peaks of mountains, others state that they have no meaning and are just an abstract composition that functions to incite meditation. Gazing at dramatic natural scenery was considered highly beneficial to the human spirit and helpful in gaining enlightenment</p>
<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism</strong>. Predating this are philosophies and historical texts that are based around <strong>nature and the cosmos</strong>. This later influenced <strong>Chinese Buddhism</strong>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these holy men were <strong>drawn to the mountains</strong> to establish temples. Mountains also appear in art as early as the Han Dynasty as a looming background within a variety of themes and idealized settings.</p>
<p><strong>Landscape paintings</strong> would become its own genre by the late Tang Dynasty. This would also become a major theme for poets.</p>
<h5><strong>Plants and Animals</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Animals, both real and imagined </strong>also made their way into Chinese art such as<strong> serpents, bovines, cicadas, dragons, and phoenixes, along with vegetation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dragons</strong> are symbolic of <strong>male energy</strong>, while<strong> phoenixes are symbolic of female energy</strong> and illustrate the connection of the natural and spirit world in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Painted designs and pictures on Chinese porcelain exemplify this. Porcelain resembles jade and, when fired, would have a translucent, shiny surface. It was, therefore, highly regarded like jade in Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In Daoism <strong>tigers represent the ying and dragons the yang.</strong> They were also considered a balance to one another as the tiger is from the real world and the dragon is from the imagined. The tigers appear in Buddhism as well, such as jataka tales with other Buddhist figures. The Chinese dragon was reimagined from Naga the Indian deity or god of snakes.</p>
<p>Animals are vividly portrayed in <strong>art from the ancient Near East</strong> and appear as part of ever day life. They appear in flocks, as pack animals for work and travel, in hunting scenes, and ridden in battle. Horses were of upmost importance as both transportation and warfare. These scenes appear on painted pottery, stone that has been carved and in metal works.</p>
<p><strong>Wild animals</strong> were portrayed as powerful. <strong>Lions guarded royal doorways</strong> during the Urak period. Other creatures such as vultures, foxes, and bulls were also prominently featured. Wings, claws, horns, and animals fighting were all elements that provoked thoughts of danger.</p>
<p>Many of these great <strong>animals were linked to gods</strong> such as the storm god Adad as the bull. Other gods appeared winged.</p>
<p><strong>Domesticated animals</strong> were popular accessories in the Near East. In fact, many were first domesticated here including dogs, cats, goats, sheep, and donkeys. Camels would come later in the first century A.D. These animals appeared in decorative arts and in amulets showing that they were considered lucky and protective</p>
<p>Animals also appeared in art as <strong>a sign of fertility</strong>, featured in pairs, families and mothers caring for there young. <strong>Animals appearing in repetitive sequencing symbolize abundance</strong>.</p>
<p>Animals were also used ritualistically and were sacrificed to the gods and part of ceremonial hunts. Through this association, animals in art were part of temples, as too were the vessels used in such ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>Works crafted from ivory</strong> became increasingly sought after and were a sign of the elite. Vast collections have been found in Neo-Assyrian palaces.</p>

<p><strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>is an example of<strong> decorative arts </strong>that is both beautiful and utilitarian. Made of  solid <strong>ivory</strong> from the tusk of an elephant, the work stands <strong>6 inches tall</strong>.  Ivory was expensive, durable, smooth, elegant, and easily carved, making it a highly desirable material. This pyxis was made from the famous workshop of Madinat al-Zahra</p>
<p>Islamic art is not always <strong>aniconic</strong>, meaning it does not use animal or human form. It is religiously <strong>aniconic</strong> only. In non-religious or secular and for private use, representational images can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong>: literally means “<em>fear of emptiness</em>” and refers to artwork that is completely full of imagery. This decorative work is an example of this. The work is dense, overcrowded, and intricate, with no space for recession.</p>

<h5><strong>Politically Utilitarian</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>was a gift to 18-year-old al-Mughira, son of a caliph, as a coming of age present. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is cylindrical box with a separate lid. The one has a <strong>utilitarian</strong> purpose, as it was used for cosmetics. Royal men wore makeup, particularly eye makeup, as a sign of status.</p>
<p><strong>Ivory objects were given to royalty</strong> on important occasions. Think marriage, birth, and coming of age.</p>
<p>Such works expresses the political authority of the Spanish Umayyads.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This work is decorated with four eight-lobed medallions. This is symbolism of the number eight. It represents the eight levels of Paradise. There are carved <strong>falconers, griffons, peacocks, birds, and animals to be hunted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Royal iconography</strong> includes courtly figures and lute players. <strong>Falcons</strong> were a symbol of Umayyad legitimacy and power. Date palm trees may allude to the lost Umayyad lands of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The <strong>two lions</strong> symbolizing the Umayyads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The inscription reads: “God’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Power and Symbolism in Nature</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>power and symbolism of nature</strong> is portrayed and perceived differently by different audiences. In <strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong>, nature is seen as dangerous and antagonistic.</p>
<p>Mt. Fuji, which is usually depicted as large and imposing, is small and dwarfed in the background compared to the wave. This change in the presentation of Mt. Fuji symbolizes the power of nature and its ability to conquer. Even a large and imposing mountain is dwarfed in the face of nature. Two boats with faceless passengers are about to be toppled by a huge, dragon claw-like wave. This demonstrates the dominance of nature, that it can overpower even the largest mountains and humankind.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura</em>)</strong>, is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai</strong>. This is a <strong>polychrome woodblock print created with ink and color on paper.</strong> <em><strong>Part of the Series: Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuj</strong></em>i it measures 10 by 14 inches.</p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as The Great Wave. Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5>Content</h5>
<p><em><strong>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> is a Japanese seascape <strong><em>Ukiyo-e print</em></strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The color palette is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> is a part of the series, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play, The Great Wave stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>The apparent symbolism <strong>points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the Ukiyo-e print represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by Hokusai. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, The Great Wave was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the ukiyo-e technique.</p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p>Hokusai has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term Ukiyo-e means the floating world, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. Ukiyo-e prints were recognized by their emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>
<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in The Great Wave.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><em><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> was created as one of the thirty-six prints by Japanese <strong><em>artist Katsushika Hokusai</em></strong>. Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in The Great Wave, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><em><strong>Setting</strong></em></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Political Emphasis</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Neo-Confucianism</strong> also had political emphasis. Families emphasized loyalty to the king as part of loyalty to the family, and this was echoed in artworks. <strong><em>The Portrait of Sin Sukju</em></strong> was a propagandistic painting on silk that demonstrated Sin Sukju as a powerful prime minister in Korea. It also contrasts the vegetal and landscape views in <strong><em>Travelers among Mountains and Stream</em></strong>s by using figural imagery, depicting Sin Power and Authority</p>

<h5><strong>Power and Authority</strong></h5>
<p>Power and authority were demonstrated by patrons <strong>through the sculptures of Buddha</strong> in both the <strong>Longmen caves and the Daibutsuden temple </strong>and in in the <strong>Todai-ji complex</strong>. Artwork and architecture is used to support government and political structure.</p>
<p>The<strong> Forbidden City</strong> in Beijing, China is an imperial palace compound and served not only as the home of emperors and their household but as the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government. Planned according to traditional Chinese principles, the city is walled and laid out on a rectangular grid with evenly spaced streets.</p>
<p>The balance and symmetry of the plan of the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> reflects ancient Chinese beliefs about the harmony of the universe and emphasize the emperor’s role as the Son of Heaven, whose duty was to maintain the cosmic order from his throne in the middle of the world. The monumental nature of the <strong>stone, marble, and brick connect with the demonstration of power and authority</strong>. This provides a distinct contrast when compared to Sukju without any surroundings.</p>

<p>The <strong>courtyard style residence</strong> uses a <strong>geometric organization</strong> of space that is aligned with the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>Outer court represented <strong>Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the South.</li>
<li>Belonged to realm of state affairs and only men had access to its spaces.</li>
<li>Included: emperor’s formal reception halls, places for religious rituals and state ceremonies.</li>
<li>Hall of Supreme Harmony represented central focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inner court represented <strong>Heaven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the North</li>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>Eastern and Western sides reserved for retired emperor and empress dowager</li>
<li>Also included <strong>Buddhist and Daoist temples</strong> building during Ming Dynasty</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>The symbolism shows the relationship between Heaven and Earth. Emperor is the Son of Heaven and can mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>Power is conveyed visually and there is a spatial representation of power. This shows the emperor’s power over laws and regulations since he can regulate and reorganize nature.</p>
<p>The architects followed ideal cosmic order and social hierarchy in Confucianism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The complex was to showcase Yongle’s magnificence during turbulent years after the overthrow of his nephew. It was a visual assertion of imperial power with ceremonial space, ritual space and living space.</p>
<p>It was named the <strong><em>Forbidden Palace</em></strong> because only royal court could enter.</p>
<p>The complex was a political and ritual center for China for 500+ years. It was a place of power and propaganda that legitimized rulers and became visual evidence for the Mandate of Heaven.</p>

<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 North Gate (Gate of Divine Might)</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some key points about the <strong>North Gate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walls are 30 feet high to keep people out</li>
<li>Designed to withstand cannons</li>
<li>Gate from which troops would often leave</li>
<li>3 openings: middle one was reserved for the emperor only</li>

<p>This gate has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five entryways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest in the center was used as passage for Ming and Qing emperors.</li>
<li>The side ones are smaller and were used for officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-eaved roof is guarded by two pairs of <strong>Ming stone lions.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Mao Zedong</strong></h5>
<p>Today the gate is characterized by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong weighing 1.5 tons. Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two placards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: Long Live the People’s Republic of China</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrases have significant meaning as <strong>“Long Live”</strong> was reserved for Emperors of China. But afterward it was available to common people because Mao had liberated it…just like Forbidden City!</p>
<p>In 1989, three dissidents attacked the portrait with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests. They were sent to prison for 17 years (released 2006).</p>

<p>The Emperor’s seat is in here and was meant for grand ceremonies such as enthronements and weddings. From here, the emperor could establish cosmic order and mediate between both worlds. This is the middle of the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>9 main bays wide and 9 dragons inside (9 is a special number)</li>
<li>Bureaucrats and officials would gather in front of the gate at 3 am waiting for the emperor to walk by at 5am.</li>

<p><strong>The Northeastern section </strong>was a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. He planned to retire and abdicate, then settle down in modest quarters here, along with his major art collection.</p>
<p>This part of the complex is called the <strong>Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service</strong> and this room is the theater room. The layout mirrors the arrangement of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The finest craftsmen of the day spent <strong>five years building</strong> just this palace. He never spent a night here.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the palace was chained shut and largely forgotten. It has now been restored to what was imagined it would have been like.</p>
<p>If he didn’t sleep here, what did he do here?</p>
<p>There were <strong>gardens, banquet rooms, prayer halls</strong>, an <strong>opera house,</strong> and a <strong>theater room</strong>. It was a place to <strong>meditate, write poetry</strong>, and <strong>enjoy company of concubines.</strong></p>
<p>It was a simple rectangular room with translucent <strong>embroidered scenes</strong>, <strong>jade-inlaid wall hangings</strong> and <strong>Chinese carved decoration. </strong>There were also panoramic <strong>murals painted on silk</strong>, <strong>wisteria painted on ceilings</strong>, along with <strong>magpies flying over the tiled rooves</strong> of the palace. This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l’oeil</strong>). This was a testament to the emperor’s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.</p>
<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ming</strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant</strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.</p>
<p>The construction of the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son’s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).</p>
<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.  The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China.</p>
<h4><strong>Idealism + Politics = Propaganda</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>propagandistic properties of artwork</strong> also demonstrate power and authority, and the power of governments to regulate artwork. In 1949, Mao Zhedong came to power in China and encouraged artists to create art that conveyed Communist ideas in methods that were accessible to the masses and the new Communist state of China.</p>

<p>The painting <strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> is an example of the multitude of realistic oil paintings of workers, soldiers, and peasants that resulted from his encouragement. These paintings replaced the traditional ink paintings of natural landscapes largely <strong>due to the strict regulation of artistic production in 1966.</strong></p>
<p>At this time, the Chinese government pushed a cultural revolution and sought to modernize itself by destroying anything that resembled tradition.</p>
<p>Many traditional artists were humiliated and tortured, and their artworks destroyed. Younger artists <strong>created works that would be distributed by the government</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> became one of the most popular images of the Cultural Revolution in China.</p>

<p><strong>Japanese art is deeply interested both in nature</strong> (and the spirits imbedded in it) and the ways in which nature relates to humans.  This is evident in architecture, ukiyo-e prints and other landscape paintings.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Japanese islands were sheltered, or at least removed, from cultural and political exchanges with other regions</li>
<li>Never successfully invaded</li>
<li>1854: Opened to foreign markets by American Commodore Matthew Perry
<ul>
<li>Shipment of <strong>ukiyo-e prints</strong> to European markets (17<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> centuries Japanese woodblock prints)</li>
<li>popular themes: beautiful women, erotica, actors, sumo wrestlers, history and folk tales, landscapes, travel scenes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Shinto </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>beauty of the changing seasons has always been celebrated</strong> by the people of Japan. Each season brings its own celebrations and festivals. This is also part of <strong>Shinto</strong>, Japan’s native belief system and indigenous religion. It has been preserved in and has been part of the everyday fabric of Japanese life.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine Shinto</strong> had a close relationship to the Imperial royal family and was both a religion and a state. Sect Shinto originated around the 19th century and has 13 major sects organized by the founder or systematizer. Folk Shinto is based on Japanese folk beliefs. All three are interrelated.</p>
<p>Poetry and visual arts are part of Shinto. Kokinshu (A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern) is the first known works of Japanese poetry, and nature is the inspiration. Shinto paintings of the Heian period show Spring blossoms Autumnal leaves and winter scenes.</p>

<p>The work above, from the Metropolitan Museum is entitled <strong><em>Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons</em></strong>. It was painted in the late 16th century during the Momoyama period (1573-1615), in Japan. The work is<strong> a pair of six-panel folding screens</strong> with <strong>ink, color, gold, and gold leaf.</strong> The<strong> story moves from right to left.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a close up.</p>

<p><strong>Many paintings depict the transitioning of seasons</strong>. A theme in both Shinto and Buddhist art is the theme of beauty and brevity. For a more minute view of seasonal changes flowering plants and flowers become painting compositions. Decorative arts were adorned in the same way. Think ceramics, lacquerware and even kimonos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>School of Buddhism arrived from China in the 12<sup>th</sup> century</li>
<li>Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century via Silk Road traders.</li>
<li>It quickly became associated with the Imperial Court and the elite showed status this way.</li>
<li>Reject worldliness in favor of courage, loyalty, and enlightenment</li>
<li>Taught through introspection, not books</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Painting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highly esteemed in Japan, particularly in form of printing</li>
<li><strong>Two-color and polychrome</strong> introduced in 18th century</li>
<li>Ukiyo-e prints (17th-19th centuries Japanese woodblock prints; genre scenes are popular themes: beautiful women, erotica, actors, sumo wrestlers, history and folk tales, landscapes, travel scenes)</li>
<li>“pictures of the floating world”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Simplistic architectural designs inspired by Zen Buddhism. The buildings are typically made of wood and a single-story. The works are intended to blend into the surrounding environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patronage: Royal family members and Buddhist monasteries</li>

<p><strong>Todai-ji</strong> in <strong>Nara, Japan</strong> was created by various artists, <strong>including sculptors Unkei and Keikei, as well as the Kei School</strong>. Material <strong>includes bronze and wood (sculpture)</strong> as well as <strong>wood with ceramic-tile roofing (architecture).</strong></p>
<p>In the 8th century, this was the largest building project on Japanese soil ever. The construction was modeled after Chinese Tang architecture and <strong>sinification.</strong> It was <strong>based on the pagoda</strong> style and multi-eaved buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Elaborate bracketing systems</strong> were used such as <strong>complex wooden joints instead of nails</strong> to hold the building together. Large sturdy pillars helped to funnel weight to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Cypress Wood</strong></p>
<p>The Japanese have always had a close link to the natural environment and history of wood craftsmanship. An enormous amount of the material was required.  <strong>Cypress was the main wood used</strong>. It grows up to 40 meters, is naturally straight, has tight grain that easily splits into long beams and is resistant to rot.</p>
<p><strong>The main Buddha Hall</strong> used 2200 acres of local forest and it had 84 massive pillars. The wood had to be brought from many miles away and came from ten different provinces.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Place of worship for Buddhists and place of learning for Buddhist students</li>
<li>Displayed Emperor Shomu’s power, piety, and prestige</li>
<li>To unite Japanese clans under his rule, he promoted spiritual unity across the land that he was the leader of</li>
<li>Todai-ji was to be the chief temple of Buddhism in Japan</li>
</ul>
<p>During the rebuilding the Minamoto family was eager to present itself as national saviors who were pious. They wanted to seem morally superior to the Taira clan. Thus, political propaganda during each of its building phases.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Todai-ji</strong> is also known as <strong>“Eastern Temple”.</strong></p>

<p>What is unusual here is that the first and second story are of equal width.  Usually, the second story is not as wide. So, this is meant to impress.</p>
<p>It uses wooden bracketing that was constructed during the reconstruction. The wooden bracketing is from Song China.</p>

<p><strong>Nios are aggressive guardian deities of Buddhism</strong> that were originally a Hindu idea. They justify the force by eliminating evil.</p>
<p><strong>Nios are the Japanese version of vajrapani</strong> and are usually used as guardians at the gates of Buddhist temples. They are a metaphor for shoguns who will defend their Buddhist faith</p>
<p>The large-scale rebuilding in the 12th century created a multitude of commissions for buildings and sculptors. To fulfill demands, the Kei School of Sculpture emerged. This was the peak of Japanese sculpture.  The work was noted for the muscularity and dynamism of its figures. Sculptors such as Unkei and Keikei became famous.</p>
<p>The Nios are 26 feet tall, with powerful and dynamic bodies, in dramatic contrapposto.  They have bulging muscles and popping veins. The hair is pulled tightly back, and a sense of movement is created.  Originally, they were covered in black lacquer.</p>
<p><strong>Joint wood block technique:</strong> layered planks, hollowed blocks, lacquered</p>

<p>The <strong>Great Buddha</strong> was originally created between 743 – 752 CE. It would have been complete in 749, but the snail-curly hair took an additional 3 years. At over 49 feet tall, it is Japan’s largest statue. It represents Vairocona Buddha the Buddha of wisdom and therefore must be larger than life.</p>
<p>The work was Commissioned by Emperor Shomu, and it required all the available copper in Japan. This was then mixed with tin to create bronze.</p>
<p>When completed, the Japanese court, officials and Buddhist dignitaries from China and India attended an “eye-opening” ceremony. An Indian monk painted in the Buddha’s eyes, symbolically imbuing it with life.</p>
<p><strong>Daibutsu</strong> is Japanese for Giant Buddha.</p>
<h5><strong>Buddhism in Japan</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century via Silk Road traders.</p>
<p>It quickly became associated with the Imperial Court and the elite showed status this way.</p>
<p>During the 8th century Emperor Shomu promoted Buddhism across the state and built Todai-ji for the Kegon sect of Buddhism (earliest form of Japanese Buddhism). This was part of a large building project where he ordered temples, monasteries, and convents to be built throughout Japan’s 66 provinces.</p>
<p>In the 12th century, during the rebuild, there was the Gempei Civil War between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto clan won as the Buddhists from Todai-ji had allied with them.</p>
<p>Taira clan burned the site in 1180 as retaliation. The destruction shocked Japan.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rebuild</strong></h5>
<p>The Minamoto elite contributed funds to rebuilding it and then looked like benefactors.</p>
<p>The Buddhist priest Chogen was placed in charge of reconstruction. He made three trips to China to observe what Song China was doing artistically.</p>
<p>In 1700 Buddha was redone.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Traditional Joint Block Technique</strong></h5>
<p>For <strong>wood sculptures,</strong> the joint block technique (yosegi zukuri-multiple-block technique) of creating sculpture was introduced, in the latter half of the 10th century. This was due primarily to the lack of large trees and a growing creative impulse to create gigantic statues. First it was developed for seated sculptures by a Fujiwara sculptor, Jocho. Later the Jocho’s style of statues was extended for standing statues.  Sculptor Unkei (1148 – 1223 AD) was well known for using this technique.</p>
<ol>
<li>A schematic drawing was prepared.</li>
<li>The center log was cut into a rectangular shape.</li>
<li>The head and body were roughly carved from a center block, and other blocks were joined to it by means of clamps and/or a peg system.</li>
<li>There were five basic ways to combine blocks of wood</li>
<li>Each block was split in sections.</li>
<li>To reduce splitting due to the contraction/dilation of wood the sections were hollowed out to a thickness of two or three centimeters.</li>
<li>The pieces are rejoined permanently, and final carving completed.</li>
<li>Final modeling and finishing are followed by a coat of lacquer or covered by a lacquered cloth, and coloring and gilding are added.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fewer knots and a thinner cross-section were preferred by artists, because these pieces tended to crack less. Wood needed to be dried in a controlled environment to avoid the exterior drying out, while the center was still moist. Shrinkage rates could also increase cracks.</p>
<p>Smaller trees could be used with this method, which was beneficial because at the time there was a lack of large ones. This also ensured speedier production. These smaller pieces were also more portable and could be carried back and forth to the off-site shop easily. Additionally, this prefabrication methods allowed for easier repairs of the statues.</p>
<p>The result was sculptures that were less expensive.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Pagoda(to)</strong></h5>
<p>Pagoda(to) is a tiered tower with projecting roofs. It evolved from the Indian stupa.  A pagoda plays a very important role in remembering ancestral spirits, and in religion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2221" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pagoda-drawing.jpg?resize=400%2C804&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="804" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pagoda-drawing.jpg?w=223&amp;ssl=1 223w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pagoda-drawing.jpg?resize=149%2C300&amp;ssl=1 149w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Differences</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>One can enter a pagoda</li>
<li>One can only circumambulate a stupa</li>
<li>Pagoda is much taller than a stupa</li>
<li>Pagoda links people with the heavenly realms by reaching higher</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>The stupa traveled from India to China via Buddhism. It developed into a structure with layers and tiers that became taller.  This influenced the Japanese on how they both designed and built pagodas.</p>

<h5><strong>Structure of Wooden Pagodas</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>pagoda</strong> is usually built in a square plan. <strong>Each level contains 12 pillars</strong> and a heart pillar in the center. Earth is symbolized by the square shape, while the center is the “axle of the world”.</p>
<p>Some Buddhist temples in Japan still feature pagodas. These are usually <strong>five levels. </strong>This represents the <strong>five elements or the godai. </strong></p>
<p>These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>chi (earth)</li>
<li>sui (water)</li>
<li>ka (fire)</li>
<li>fu (wind)</li>
<li>ku (void, sky, or heaven).</li>
</ul>
<p>The eaves are heavy with clay tiles, so the <strong>finial or spire</strong> is used as a counterweight. It is made from copper or iron.</p>
<p>The <strong>shinbashira</strong>, is an element rarely seen in Chinese or Korean pagodas. This central pillar runs from the bottom to the top. It allows all floors to be able to sway independently. This is especially important during earthquakes and typhoons.</p>

<h5><strong>Stone Pagodas (sekito)</strong></h5>
<p>This is the generic term for any pagoda or stupa made from stone. These are always built with an odd number of stories. These structures are more solid than the wooden variety. Initially, these acted as a grave or monument. Now, these pagodas are garden decorations.</p>
<h5><strong>Types of Stone Pagodas</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gorinto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>five pieces of stone</li>
<li>grave marker erected for the departed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Muhoto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pagoda shaped like an egg</li>
<li>grave marking for Buddhist priests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hoto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pagoda associated with the Buddhist deity, Tahou nyorai</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hokyointo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>low rectangle with square body</li>
<li>used as a grave marker</li>
<li>images include Buddha, a Sanskrit syllable, or an umbrella with wings</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Gardens and Pagodas</strong></h5>
<p>In Japan, quite often pagodas will be surrounded by gardens. Ponds both natural and constructed are nearby. The gardens inspire peace and a time for quiet reflection.</p>
<h4><strong>(8) 203. <em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong></h4>

<p>The focus of the drawing and writing in the Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace is on the battle scene. This emphasizes its violence, the skills of the samurai, as well as the luxury of the emperor and of his consorts.</p>
<blockquote><p>The text usually precedes the illustration, but in this case, it frames it. The scroll’s inscription summarizes the events. “It was more than horrible.”</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>The Ongoing Battle of the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>The artist removes the roof of the palace and places himself at an elevated “bird’s eye” observation point.  Here, he describes every scene in detail. This technique was largely used in <strong>yamato-e paintings</strong> and creates a feeling of peeking indiscreetly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> uses a continuous narration technique. The action moves from right to left in panels that are unschooled by the narrator.</p>
<p>A single ox carriage transports your eye in the whirlwind of carts and mounted warriors. The wheels of the cart are spinning, and people are trapped.</p>
<p>A few characters appear more than once. Note the courtier Fushiwara and the mounted Minamoto Yoshitomo with his samurai horned helmet tied with a chin strap. The main characters are seen pushing the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa in the carriage.</p>
<p>This work <strong>combines poems with drawings</strong>.</p>
<p>The artist uses a differentiated portraiture technique for the samurai heroes emphasizing their emotions and ruthlessness. Meanwhile the courtiers, and court ladies were depicted fugitively with stylized aristocratic dignified faces, lacking personality.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Going from right to left</strong>, the hand scroll offered a <strong>cinema experience</strong>. Your eye draws imaginary diagonal lines, while following the ox cart carrying away the captured retired emperor. The use of diagonal lines emphasizes movement and disentangles the viewer from the mass of the samurai killing courtiers.</p>
<p>The storytelling exhibits symmetry and relies on a crescendo to capture the viewer’s attention. It starts with a nicely decorated single ox carriage. Following the carriage, the viewer gets entangled among colliding carts and warriors.</p>
<p>The violence escalates. It culminates as the palace is engulfed by flames. Courtiers have their necks cut. Court ladies in heavy silk dresses are ambushed by arrows and chose to commit suicide by jumping in the wells.</p>

<p>After kidnapping the retired emperor, the samurai flew on their horses leaving behind a disaster.  In the end a running archer followed by a samurai led the rebels far away from the palace engulfed by flames. The samurai break free. They seem to draw energy from the violence they created.</p>
<p>Without any remorse for the wreckage, the painting celebrates the samurai’s swift and fatal power. It is the Minamoto clan (the victors) point of view.</p>
<p>The <strong>brushstrokes are refined</strong> while depicting the palace, the gateways, and people at the court. The <strong>brushstrokes become brisk</strong> for the horses and the samurai.</p>
<p>The dramatic moment of the battle is captured using vivid red and green colors. The use of black for the palace focuses the viewer on its veranda event in which the emperor is forced to enter the cart.</p>
<p>The painting is intended to be realistic. The attention to detail makes it a valuable historical reference.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A handscroll tells a story section</strong>, by section as it is horizontally unrolled.  <strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> gives realistic details on the conflict between rival samurai clans.</p>
<p>It was made in the 13th century to commemorate a 12th century event, glorifying the clan Minamoto and the Samurai in general.</p>
<p>The mounted armored archer and their war tactics seemed to illustrate the words of the Chinese tactician Sun Tzu (The Art of War):</p>
<p><em>In raiding and plundering be like fire…Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. </em></p>
<p>The facts in the painting happened in the end of the Heian period. The painting was commissioned in the Kamakura period (1185 -1333) and initiated by the Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo. During the Kamakura period the samurai were an established “knightly” class and Minamoto were the shogun’s clan.</p>
<p>The work also has documentary value on the Heiji Rebellion (1159-60). This detail-oriented painting provides precious information on the armor, head protection and weapons of the samurai, as well as the weaponry of other foot soldiers. Observe the historical references of the clothes of courtiers and court ladies. Also look at the architecture and decoration of royal gateways and buildings.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>hand scroll technique probably originated in India around 4th century BCE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Around the 6th century CE., it arrived via the Silk Road</strong> all the way to Japan together with the Buddhist religious scrolls and the Chinese writing system. It took almost two centuries for Japanese Buddhists to produce their own scrolls.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> is a narrative painting, called <strong>e-maki</strong>. It combines an illustrated hand scroll, with the sequential technique of the Buddhist scrolls, and the traditional Japanese painting, yamato-e, developed alongside poetry during the Heian period.</p>
<p>Initially e-maki depicted literary classics such as <em>The Tale of Genji</em>. In the military ruled Kamakura era, illustrated handscrolls often had a focus on “war tales” like this one. The action-oriented paintings or the ones detailing historical events were preferred by men. They were called otoko‐e, or “men’s paintings”. An entire set was dedicated to the events of the Heiji rebellion. Another scroll tells the story of Taira recuperating the retired Emperor and one is only remnants.</p>
<p>The attack on the retired emperor was insignificant, but the painting is a masterpiece of Japanese painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>The audience of an emaki was reduced. It is an intimate object that was held in the hands of the narrator who presented the story scene by scene to a small group of listeners.</p>
<p>With their exquisite calligraphy and paintings, generally done by official court painters, the emaki appealed to an educated elite, such as the imperial family, the shogun, or Buddhist monks.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>The scene takes place during the Heiji Rebellion at the end of the Heian period. This was known as the period of calm and tranquility. This is considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court. At the end of this era the sovereignty laid with the emperor, but in fact the power was wielded by the noble clans.</p>
<p>The Fujiwara and afterwards the Taira clan controlled the imperial court by marrying their daughters with the emperor and relegating the emperors to endless ceremonial functions. Japanese emperors reclaimed their power by abdicating in favor of a successor and relegating that one to conduct the ceremonies. Disputes ensued each time that the successor to the throne was chosen or an emperor retired.</p>
<p>By participating in all these disputes, the samurai warrior class steadily rose and made political gains throughout the entire Heian period.</p>
<p>In 1159, during the Heiji Rebellion the courtier Fujiwara no Nobuyori seemed the help of the samurai Minamoto no Yoshitomo to attack the palace. They started a fire and mercilessly killed courtiers and court ladies, in a bid to seize both the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa and his son from the power grip of the rival samurai clan, Taira.</p>
<p>Minamoto tried to control the emperor. Another scroll continues the story by telling how the Taira managed to regain control of the emperor. The continued rivalry between Minamoto and Taira led to the civil Genpei War, the destruction of the Taira and the establishment of the Minamoto Shogunate.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural context of the artwork(s):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong></p>
<p>The Bayeux tapestry is an embroidered (not woven) 70-meter-long scroll telling the story of the Norman conquest of England of 1066. It is a propaganda tool which tells the story <strong>glorifying the Normands and justifying the conquest of England</strong>.</p>
<p>The patron was Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, William the Conqueror’s half-brother. He ordered it to embellish the newly built Bayeux cathedral.</p>
<p><strong>Documentary value on the Norman and Saxon lives in the 11<sup>th</sup> century</strong></p>
<p>This was made shortly <strong>after the Battle of Hastings</strong> in 1066. The central panel of this detail-oriented embroidery provides precious information on <strong>the weaponry, armory of the Normands, on their fleet and cavalry techniques, but also on the royal banquets</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Ryoan-ji (wet and dry gardens) is a rock garden in Kyoto, Japan</strong> that <strong>measures 100 feet by 33 feet. </strong></p>
<p>It has a <strong>rectangular plot of pebbles, surrounded by low earthen walls, with 15 rocks</strong> laid out in small groups on patches of moss. Rocks are encircled by white pebbles which are smooth river rock.</p>
<h5><strong>Spotlight on the Rocks</strong></h5>
<p>The rocks are in five groups with 15 rocks in total.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 group of 5</li>
<li>2 groups of 3</li>
<li>2 groups of 2</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrangement of rocks leads the viewers’ eyes from left to right. Balance is achieved by small groups which create a rhythm and overall sense of harmony.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a <strong>Zen temple</strong>. It serves as a place of spiritual refreshment, contemplation, and rejuvenation. Since the elite practiced Zen Buddhism, this was a sign of status. It was used to incite meditation.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2069" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=944%2C607&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="944" height="607" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?w=330&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>dry garden</strong> was viewed from a temple deck as an exercise in enlightenment and acceptance. No matter what vantage point you have, you can only ever see 14 out of the 15 rocks. It is said that you can only see the 15th rock through attaining enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>The number 15 denotes completeness in Buddhism</strong>.</p>
<p>Buddhists maintain completeness is not possible.</p>
<p>If you TRULY accept that you can’t see the stone (that you cannot have completeness), then you become enlightened, and THEN you can see the 15th stone.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2200" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-B.jpg?resize=795%2C528&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="795" height="528" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-B.jpg?w=795&amp;ssl=1 795w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-B.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-B.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Visiting this dry garden is supposed to encourage meditation.  It is a place of contemplation and meditative practice for monks who rake the rocks daily into different patterns.</p>

<p>The lesson is that you can work very hard at something – and you should – but that it will be gone the next day. This doesn’t mean that we should work less hard but rather appreciate things while we do them and accept that they will end or disappear.</p>
<h5><strong>A Wet Garden</strong></h5>

<p>A wet garden is an Immersive and natural experience. Meditation and contemplation encouraged through strolling around the garden. The sound of the water and birds is meant to be calming.</p>
<p>This reveals the deep respect the Japanese have for the natural world, and the belief that lessons and enlightenment can be learned/attained through the natural world.</p>

<h5><strong>A Visual of the Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<p>The dry garden is carefully raked each day by the Buddhist monks. These meticulous arrangements of rocks and pebbles are circled around each rock formation in particular patterns. It is unclear if these patterns have a particular meaning.</p>
<p>In 2002, a research team at Kyoto University claimed that the garden’s rocks, when viewed from the proper angle, subconsciously evoked the outline of a branching tree.</p>

<h5><strong>The Influence of Zen Buddhist Principles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Restraint, simplicity, and honesty are held in esteem</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Immersion in nature (gardens)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> was originally a Fujiwara aristocrat’s villa during the Heian Period. Later, a powerful warlord captured the villa and converted it to a Zen Buddhist temple in 1450 CE.</p>
<p>This was constructed for the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism that came from China in 1191 CE</p>
<p><strong>Zen gardens are a principal concept of Zen Buddhism</strong>, which was a type of Buddhism that the elite practiced because it required ample time in the day for meditation, gardening, tea-drinking</p>
<h5><strong>More About Zen Buddhism and Gardens</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Zen</strong> is the mainstream monastic <strong>form of Mahayana Buddhism</strong> in China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. <strong>The word means “meditation.”</strong> It was introduced to Japan in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. The Samurai class were the first to embrace it.</p>
<p>In <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong>, it is believed that anyone can achieve enlightenment.</p>
<p>It is also credited with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the beginning of Noh theater</li>
<li>the Japanese tea ceremony</li>
<li>a new study hall (shoin) style of Japanese architecture</li>
<li>Zen gardens</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Noh theater</strong> is based off stories where an everyday person is transformed into a superhero. Highly trained actors and musicians give stage performances dressed in masks and silk finery.</p>
<h5><strong>Kyoto Zen Gardens: The Moss Temple</strong></h5>
<p>In the beginning, Japanese gardens were highly influenced by Chinese gardens. Think lakes and islands with stones for accents. Then things changed.</p>
<p>Saihoji 西芳寺, Saihōji, more commonly known as Kokedera 苔寺, is one of Kyoto, Japan’s Unesco World Heritage Sites.  The word Kokedera means moss temple. Here is how it began.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2229" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Moss-Garden.jpg?resize=740%2C416&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Moss-Garden.jpg?w=740&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Moss-Garden.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In 1339, a Zen master <strong>Muso Soseki</strong> transformed a Buddhist temple into a Zen monastery. A traditional Heian pond was created with some rock islands or a wet garden. Then, he crafted a dry garden with three rock islands. It was all representational. One rock symbolized a turtle. The flat rocks were considered meditation rocks. Granite rocks were layered into what looked like a waterfall.</p>
<p>The garden was not kept up and later moss grew all around, forming what looked like a lake. Today, it is estimated that there are 120 different types of moss growing in the gardens.</p>
<p>Visitors can participate in the temple’s religious activities. This involves kito and shakyo. Kito is the copying of Buddhist scriptures, and low writing desks are provided. Shakyo involves chanting, which is guided by a monk.</p>
<h5><strong>The Gardens of Japan</strong></h5>
<p>Originally from Kamukura, <strong>Muso Soseki</strong> made some of the most important gardens in his time in and around Kyoto. Between the 12th and 14th century, Kamakura was the capital of Japan. It was governed by the Samurai. Many gardens were built around a huge Zen temple called Kamakura Gozan or Five Mountains. This beautiful setting was known for its bay and expansive mountains. This region also made good use of vast farmlands.</p>
<p>Kyoto too had a long history of gardens for its aristocratic and dynastic cultures. The lifestyle here was different. Boating was popular.  Pond gardens and blossoming cherry trees provided a beautiful background.</p>
<h5><strong>Karesansui</strong></h5>
<p>Karesansui is a Japanese garden style which represents the abstracted natural landscape mainly by rock compositions. Early karesansui in the 13th century was built on a hillside. Many gardens in Kamakura gardens have this style. Later karensansui in the 15th and 16th century was built on flatlands using mountains as a backdrop. Many Kyoto gardens have this style.</p>
<p>Ryoan-ji garden once used borrowed scenery from the far away Mt. Otokoyama. Then, it added a low fence to create more dimension. Minimum elements, deck, stone edges, sand, and rock add to this.</p>
<p>Later design techniques became more sophisticated pertaining to rock composition, layout of steppingstones, and even the materials used.</p>
<h5><strong>What are some of the main characteristics of a Kamakura garden? </strong></h5>
<p>Kamakura is boarded by mountains on all three sides, so this was incorporated into the gardens. This technique is called borrowed scenery or incorporating background landscapes into garden compositions. No fences were used so that the gardens blended in seamlessly.</p>
<p>Texture and color of the background played a part in composition. Gardens had to work with the natural topography and most run through valleys.</p>
<p>Early Zen temples in Kamakura incorporated ponds into gardens. These would later fuse into tea style gardens.</p>
<h5><strong>What are some of the main characteristics of a Kyoto garden?</strong></h5>
<p>Kyoto is a flatland surrounded by mountains. This provided flat gardens in an urban setting. The borrowed scenery was from the very distant mountains. Water from these mountains helped to form natural ponds.</p>
<h5><strong>Differences</strong></h5>
<p>Kamukura and Kyoto styles differ due to topography and climate.</p>
<p>The dynamic relation with a natural landscape is one of the characteristics of Kamakura gardens. It makes a significant difference between Kamakura gardens and later karesanui gardens in Kyoto.</p>
<h5><strong>Similarities</strong></h5>
<p>There are interesting similarities between Kamakura gardens and Kyoto gardens in the later period like Japanese tea gardens and the Shugaku-in garden.</p>
<p>Zen monks brought the tradition of cultivating tea from China to Japan during the very early Kamakura period (1185-1333). Monks first used a tearoom, before a whole tea house was constructed. Gardens were part of the overall ambience.</p>
<p>Shūgaku-in is comprised of three gardens connected by gravel paths. These wind through vegetables paths and fields of rice.  There is the upper garden, middle garden, and upper garden. Emperor Gomizuno-o (1596-1680) built these gardens as a retreat just outside of Kyoto.</p>

<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> by artist Ogata Korin was created using <strong>ink, watercolor, and gold leaf on paper</strong>. Each stand <strong>5 feet tall by 5 feet and 6 inches wide</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Beauty of the Form </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Two paired paper panels</li>
<li>Composition fills screen but is a simplified composition</li>
<li>Pared image down to the essentials to magnify important parts</li>
<li>Use of negative space (gold)</li>
<li>Abstraction/simplification and naturalism exist together</li>
<li>Background: subtle grid of gold leaf</li>
<li>Space tips upward</li>
<li>Patterned design of river shows movement</li>
<li>Serpentine contour of lake</li>
<li>Interplay of color, form, texture</li>
<li>New method: tarashikomi (tear-a-she-KO-me) blended different colors together while the bottom layer was still wet (this is the European method of wet-on-wet&#8211;just the Japanese version.)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> is a meditation on the transience of nature. It is the old versus new and a lesson of human existence. What was new will become old. Yet, there are merits to each part of life.</p>
<p>This work also contributes to an aesthetic pleasure. To decorate for one’s house in such an expensive way shows signs of status.</p>
<p>Folding screens were popular forms of art and interior décor.</p>
<h5><strong>The Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are two folding screens.</p>
<p>On the left the white plum tree grows off the paper. It is an older tree that bends downward. It flowers with a calm, mature, stable wisdom.</p>

<p>The stream at the center cuts through the pair of screens. It gives the sense of expanding form. The water looks to be moving because it is painted with swirls through tarashikomi.</p>
<p>Traditional Images of Inspiration</p>
<p>It was common in Japan to use traditional images of nature to inspire meditation, contemplation, and a source of healing.</p>
<h5><strong>Rimpa Artists and Works</strong></h5>
<p>In the 19th century, art historians termed artists like Korin “Rimpa” which literally means School of Korin.</p>
<h5><strong>Rimpa work is characterized by:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>abstraction + naturalism</li>
<li>simplified compositions</li>
<li>sensuality in how the paint is applied with the tarashikomi method</li>
<li>Rimpa artists develop tarashikomi (wet on wet technique of applying and mixing paint; creates a swirly look)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Rimpa artists were inspired by:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>textiles (remember Korin’s family background)</li>
<li>ceramics</li>
<li>lacquerware which was all decorated in a traditional Japanese patterned manner</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Favourite scenes included:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Passage of time</li>
<li>Seasons</li>
<li>Japanese literature (example: Tale of Genji – story of Heian Era extravagance)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ogata Korin (1658-1868)</strong> was the son of a merchant family who dealt in fabrics, and textiles for kimonos. Their clients included samurai and nobility. The family owned a lot of art by artists who used traditional Japanese flattening and decorative patterns. The artist was inspired by this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa </em></strong><strong>(Kanagawa oki nami ura),</strong> is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai. </strong></p>
<p>This is a<strong> polychrome woodblock print </strong>created with<strong> ink and color on paper. Part of the Series: <em>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em> </strong>it measures<strong> 10 by 14 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em>.</strong> Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled <em>Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji</em>.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is a Japanese seascape <strong>Ukiyo-e print</strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The <strong>color palette</strong> is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em> is a part of the series</strong>, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play<strong><em>, The Great Wave</em></strong> stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>The apparent <strong>symbolism points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the <strong>Ukiyo-e print</strong> represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of <strong>a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang</strong>, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by <strong>Hokusai</strong>. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, <strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the <strong>ukiyo-e technique.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Dispaly of Emotion</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Hokusai</strong> has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term <strong>Ukiyo-e means the floating world</strong>, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. <strong>Ukiyo-e prints</strong> were recognized by their <strong>emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</strong></p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>

<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the <strong>influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art</strong>. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> was created as one of the thirty-six prints <strong>by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.</strong> Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in <strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong>, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Japanese Paintings</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yamato-e</strong> painting flourished in Japan during the <strong>Heian period (794–1185</strong>). In the late 9<sup>th</sup> century, Japan stopped trading with China, after several centuries. Instead, the country looked inward. This was known as “the period of calm and tranquility,” or the Heian period. The court was at the center creating innovative new trends in painting and literature.</p>
<p>The term <strong>yamato-e</strong> literally means <strong>“Japanese painting”.</strong> This was a term used to distinguish Japanese painting from Chinese painting.</p>
<p>Japanese paintings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>tales from Japanese literature and history</li>
<li>activities and motifs associated with the four seasons</li>
<li>Japanese locales</li>
<li>Rich, rolling hills</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Heian Period and Onward</strong></h5>
<p>Later, <strong>yamato-e</strong> evolved to be not only about locale and content but also contained:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly stylized figures</li>
<li>Abbreviated facial features.</li>
<li>Paints and thick pigment</li>
<li>Clouds to hide and divide spaces</li>
<li>Blown off roof tops to glimpse inside buildings (known as <strong>fukiniki yatai</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Literature</strong></h5>
<p>One of the most famous Japanese novels ever written is entitled <strong><em>Tale of Genji. </em></strong>It was written by Murasaki Shikibu, who was a court lady, back in the year 1000. The novel inspired painting using the <strong>fukinuki yatai</strong> technique. This allows the viewer to peak in at a private scene.</p>
<p>These <strong>paintings</strong> during the <strong>Heian period (794-1185)</strong> appeared on <strong>screens and sliding doors</strong>. Such doors had a functional purpose. They divided rooms and kept spaces warm. Therefore, very few survive. It is interesting to note that these doors changed with the season with complementary images for winter, spring, summer and fall.</p>
<p><strong>Waka poetry</strong> developed alongside <strong>yamato-e</strong>. These poems are <strong>comprised of 31 syllables</strong>, either created with the paintings or inspired by them.</p>
<p><strong>Yamato-e paintings </strong>were also<strong> painted onto handscrolls </strong>and were <strong>called emaki. </strong>These works depict classic literature. Handscrolls were unrolled and read on low tables.</p>
<p><strong>Emaki </strong>were commissioned by the elite. Think the imperial elite, shogun, or monks from wealthy Buddhist temples.</p>
<p><strong>Emaki</strong> were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invented in India before the 1<sup>st</sup> century</li>
<li>Used for religious texts</li>
<li>By the 4<sup>th</sup> century A.D they were used in China</li>
<li>It took several centuries before they reached Japan—through the spread of Buddhism</li>
<li>Earliest Japanese handscroll shows the life of Buddha, created in the 8<sup>th</sup> century A.D</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Kamakura Period</strong> <strong>(1185-1333)</strong></h5>
<p>During this period new genres were evident. Now that the military was in charge, there was a call for narratives around new leaders such as the Japanese monk <strong>Shinran (1173-1263)</strong> who developed <strong>a sect of Buddhism called True Pure Land</strong>. Kakunyo (1173-1263) the grandson of Shinran wrote the first biography about his grandfather. This started the trend of including the illustrated story on handscrolls, and later hanging scrolls to be displayed publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Likeness Paintings or nise-e </strong>moved away from the highly stylized look and instead captured the attributes of a particular person. As poets were highly prized the theme of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, Japan’s very finest, became popular.</p>
<h5><strong>Muromachi Period (1392-1575)</strong></h5>
<p>Ink paintings from China threatened to overtake <strong>yamato-e</strong>, but artists from the Tosa School, the official painters to the royal court in the fifteenth century, kept these works alive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bamboo in the Four Seasons</em></strong> is <strong>a set of six panel folding screens </strong>using<strong> ink color and gold leaf on paper,</strong> in the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is <strong>attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu</strong> and was painted between the late 15<sup>th</sup> century and early 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Here the illustrations tell the story moving right to left changing seasons starting in the spring and progressing to the winter. Paintings that use the four seasons as a theme are referred to as <strong>shiki-e </strong>type of yamato-e.</p>
<p><strong>Tsukinami-e</strong> depict the changing of time as well, but through monthly cycles and nature is often intertwined with human forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Edo Period (1603-1867)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yamato-e</strong> continued to evolve and change during the Edo period. Now, the wealthy merchant class were interested. New painters entered the market. The same themes were prevalent with new stylistic elements. Other styles also emerged.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Decorative Rinpa style</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Artists created <strong>paintings, textiles, ceramics and lacquerware</strong> with vibrant colors and scenes from nature</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Wkiya woodblock prints</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Popular themes were Kabuki actors, courtesans, romantic images</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example of a <strong>Japanese painting</strong> (<strong>Yamato-e painting</strong>) from the Metropolitan Museum of Art that includes <strong>four hanging scrolls</strong> entitled:</p>
<p><strong>親鸞上人絵伝</strong></p>
<p>The work’s English title is <strong><em>The Illustrated Life of Shinran</em></strong> (Shinran shōnin eden), and the artist is unknown.</p>
<p>It was painted in the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> century known as the <strong>Edo period</strong> <strong>(1615-1868).</strong> It shows how the traditions started in the <strong>Kamakura period</strong> carried onward.</p>

<h4><strong>Theme for Chinese art: “Dynastic Power”</strong></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2157" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C558&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="558" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?w=1281&amp;ssl=1 1281w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>One of the most notable <strong>themes in Chinese art is power</strong>.</p>
<p>Power can be expressed in many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>political power</li>
<li>religious/spiritual power</li>
<li>economic power</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Displays of formal imperial/dynastic power are the most common – even in 20<sup>th</sup> century. Chinese history when dynastic power has ended, displays of political power are still common.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Confucianism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Began by Confucius</li>
<li>An ethical and philosophical system that creates an ideal man who respects traditional values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daoism (Taoism)</strong></p>
<p>Aims to find the Dao (“way”) through withdrawing from society into nature to achieve serenity. The philosophy was started by Laozi (Lao-tsu).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yin-Yang</strong></li>
<li><strong>Yin:</strong> female, soft, dark, wet, cold, passive</li>
<li><strong>Yang:</strong> male, hard, light, dry, warm, active, energy</li>
<li>Mandate of Heaven + Dynasty Cycle</li>
<li>Created an attitude of the desirability of tradition, permanence, and stability à art, just like political traditions and cultural hegemony, does not change</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Buddhism in China</strong></h5>
<p>Starting with the 1st century C.E., <strong>Buddhism brought to China new ideas about life and death</strong>, and <strong>new opportunities to assimilate and assert authority</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese rock cut caves</strong> were inspired, but different from the Indian rock cut caves. It preserved an assembly hall but instead of a stupa, it contained a Buddha statue.</p>
<p>There were Buddhist monasteries with a residence hall for the monks. The central hall (nave) was arranged to allow approaching the Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>The first patrons of Buddhism</strong> were Northern Wei rulers—a Turkic people ruling over the Han Chinese who saw in Buddhism an opportunity for consolidating their power and reduce the importance of ancestors’ veneration. Yearning for assimilation and control, the foreign rulers made use of Buddhist images for authority and power.</p>
<p>The rock-cut caves were decorated with sculptural images made after Indian/Gandhara models and with robes decorated with linear/abstract Northern Wei style.</p>
<p>The later Tang dynasty leaders Emperor Gaozong (650–685) and his consort Wu Zetian, who later enthroned herself as empress (684–704), patronized Buddhist establishments and <strong>encouraged the efforts of monks to acquire and translate Buddhist texts from India.</strong></p>
<p>During China’s golden age, Tang rulers <strong>asserted their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography</strong>. The official examination system enabled educated men to serve as government officials, and laid the foundation for lasting growth, prosperity, and cultural development in art. Think Buddhism with Chinese features.</p>
<p>From the 4th -10th CE development and flowering of <strong>Chinese Buddhism</strong> would later be exported to Korea and Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pure Land Buddhism</strong> focused on the faith in the savior Buddha Amitabha</li>
<li><strong>Chan (or Zen) Buddhism</strong>: meditation/mindfulness during daily activities</li>
<li>still imported new Indic and Central Asian practices : the devotion to the primordial Buddha Vairocana, new bodhisattvas, and the use of the mandala’s cosmic diagrams.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Funeral banner of Lady Dai </strong>is an artwork of<strong> painted silk </strong>that measure<strong> 6 feet by 7 inches long. This is an </strong>early example of painted naturalistic scenes in Chinese art.</p>
<p>During this time, we begin to see some of the Chinese 2D characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy black calligraphic line</li>
<li>use of red and black</li>
<li>stylized figures</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the earliest known Chinese portrait. Painted silk was a common and expensive artform in China.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was <strong>a sign of status</strong>, as painted silk was an expensive artform.</p>
<p>It was used to <strong>attract the spirit of the deceased</strong> to its tomb, where it could be properly started on its afterlife journey&#8211; instead of remaining on earth to bother the living. (This is like Tut’s tomb)</p>
<p>It was <strong>part of the funeral procession</strong> and was carried in front, before being draped upon her coffin.</p>
<h5><strong>Here is What We See </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical divisions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Left: yin (female component = moon)</li>
<li>Center: yin + yang</li>
<li>Right: yang (male component = sun)</li>

<li><strong>Horizontal divisions</strong>

<li>Heaven

<li>Dragons, toads, moon, crow on red sun</li>
<li>At the very top, a twisted red dragon, is an imperial ancestor (to show her noble lineage)</li>
<li>At the bottom of the cross of the T are two kneeling guides who will shepherd her to the afterlife</li>

<h5><strong>A Market for Art</strong></h5>
<p>During the <strong>Han Dynasty</strong> the Silk Road trade was incredibly popular and wealthy individuals in China invested in art.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Lady Dai?</strong></h5>
<p>She was the wife of Marquis of Dai, a high-ranking civil servant. The lady died around the age of 50. Lady Dai lived in Han Dynasty which was the Golden Age of Classical China with a highly stratified society.</p>
<p>Only elites could afford elaborate rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>The Find</strong></h5>

<p>The tombs of Marquis of Dai, Lady Dai and her son were all discovered in 1971. Lady Dai was put to rest in seven nested lacquer coffins.  Her body was found wrapped in 20 layers of silk. The airtight tomb was 36 feet underground in a clay lined and charcoal packed hole. (Charcoal absorbs moisture)</p>
<p>All the above led to a very well-preserved body. Her skin was still elastic, joints flexible, she had eyelashes and nostril hair. Blood remained in her veins, and all organs were intact.</p>

<p>She died of a heart attack. There were 138 melon seeds in her body which suggests she died shortly after eating the fruit.</p>

<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>is located at<strong> Longmen Caves, in Luoyang, China.</strong> Made from hard, gray <strong>limestone </strong>the largest Buddha<strong> measures 57 feet. </strong>These were carved<strong> in situ</strong> into <strong>living rock</strong> as <strong>high relief. </strong>Here there are 2,300 caves and niches that extends for over a mile.</p>
<p>The Buddha and bodhisattvas display a new, softer, and rounder modeling, as well as facial expressions. Vajrapani and lokapala display a more engaging and animated musculature, with forceful poses. These would have been painted in brilliant blues, reds, browns, and golds.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p>This is a place of <strong>Buddhist worship.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_2055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2055" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2055" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?resize=700%2C524&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="524" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?w=442&amp;ssl=1 442w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2055" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />Used by Permission</figcaption></figure>
<p>The patrons were emperors (and one empress) and this was the display of power and piety of these people. Rulers wielded Buddhism to affirm their piety, superiority, and tolerance.  Specifically, this revealed the strength and spirituality of Tang Dynasty. It was a metaphor for political power.</p>
<p>This arrangement with <strong>Buddha in the center</strong> emphasized a correct religious order.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Tang Dynasty was struggling to balance bureaucrats and aristocrats, who consistently posed a threat to the emperors. For emperors to sponsor productions of artworks such as these was to show that there was a likeness between the emperors and Buddha. Thus, aristocrats and bureaucrats should be subservient to the emperor, just as bodhisattvas and disciples were to Buddha.</p>
<p>This sculptural arrangement intentionally <strong>mirrored the political situation</strong> – one person is supreme.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>contains in total almost 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, more than 60 stupas, and 2800 inscriptions.</p>
<h5><strong>A Look at Fengxian Cave</strong></h5>
<p>The specific cave we are examining is called Fengxian Cave.  Here 9 figures pose as a group.</p>
<p><strong>From Left to right: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Bodhisattva</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Vairocana Buddha</strong> (Buddha who represents all the infinite wisdom in the universe),</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Bodhisattva</strong></li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A bodhisattva</strong> are Buddhists who do not pass on to nirvana, but who stays to help.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrapani</strong> are Chinese guardians of Buddha, who wields thunderbolts. The violence is justified only if there is a threat made to Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>Lokapala</strong> are heavenly kings who watch over one of each of the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>There are many <strong>smaller figures of deities, monks, and donors</strong> surrounding the nine main figures.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Most of the carvings date between the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century and the middle of the 8<sup>th</sup> century (Northern Wei through early Tang). Wei had moved capital to Luoyang in 494 CE.</p>
<p><strong>Tang Dynasty</strong> was considered the age of Buddhism in China</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddhism and Confucianism each vied for power over emperors.</li>
<li>Many Chinese, Indian, Central Asian, and Southeast Asian monks traveled through Asia, spreading Buddhism’s messages.</li>
<li>Alternating periods of Chinese Buddhism’s popularity or lack thereof prevented constant flow of work.</li>
<li>Largest period of construction (and the construction of Fengxian Caves) was sponsored by Emperor Gaozong, and his wife and <strong>the one and only empress of China, Empress Wu.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Comparison</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fengxian (Ancestor Worshipping Cave) Temple</strong> (673–75 C.E., Tang dynasty, limestone. Luoyang, Henan province)</p>
<ul>
<li>situated high above the riverbed, the array of the 9 colossal statues sponsored by Emperor Gaozong and his wife (future Empress Wu) <strong>dominate the Longmen site</strong></li>
<li>the high relief sculptures carved into hard, gray limestone are widely spaced in a semi-circle with a central monumental <strong>Buddha standing more than 55 feet high, pedestal included</strong>.</li>
<li>flanked on each side by a monk, a bodhisattva, a heavenly king, and a thunderbolt holder</li>
<li>depicts the supreme Vairochana (Primordial) Buddha of Mahayana Buddhism</li>
<li>the pairing of religious and military figures on either side of a large central Buddha symbolized the religious and military factions that together supported a strong ruler.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>an innovative composition</strong> in which the religious system mirrors the imperial system, reinforcing the Mandate of Heaven ideas with Buddhism iconism. The message is that the Tang emperor is the earthly representative of the supreme Vairochana Buddha.</p>
<p>The opulence, Buddha’s lotus position, the halo and flaming mandorla carved into the wall behind <strong>suggest the harmonious paradise of the Pure Land Buddhism</strong>. The clear and symmetrical ordering of the statues recalls a Confucian context.</p>
<p>Buddha, monks (arhats) and bodhisattvas <strong>display rounder and serene facial expressions</strong>. The heavenly guardians and the thunderbolt holder (vajrapani) are more realistic, engaging, and animated, with realistic musculature and forceful poses.</p>
<p><strong>Buddha’s features (iconography)</strong>: lotus pose, elongated earlobes, downcast eyes, a halo, and mandorla carved on the rock behind, Gandharan robes falling in concentric circles.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Fengxian (Ancestor Worshipping Cave)</strong> illustrates the <strong>Pure Land Buddhism</strong> which added mystical elements to the basic Buddhist teachings. This was popular in China and Japan. By living a moral life, through faith, trust, and a personal relationship with the (savior) Amitabha Buddha, believers reach the Pure Land a realm free of spiritual corruption, where it is easier to achieve enlightenment</p>
<p><strong>Buddhist symbolism supports the Mandate of Heaven</strong>, an ancient Chinese belief held that gods granted the emperors the right to rule based on their ability to govern well and justly.</p>

<p>The size of the stone figures announces their <strong>legitimacy, power, and life force</strong>. Just like Buddha they used to be living creatures, i.e. honored ancestors. Most of them do not face the ocean but look inland watching over their descendants.</p>
<p>The <strong>moa</strong>i are endowed with a <strong>spiritual force called MANA</strong>.</p>
<p>The carvers “awaken” the states from the compressed volcanic ash, insert eyes of white coral with inlaid pupils of red or black rock which makes their eyes staring. They are called “living faces” (Buddha’s eyes look down with compassion)</p>
<p>While <strong>moai</strong> slender arms are pressed close to the sides, Buddha’s hands and their codified mudras are an indication of his message to the world of believers.</p>
<p>They share elongated earlobes as a status sign which in Buddhism also translated in the willingness to hear the suffering.</p>
<p>Also, both statues have topknots.</p>
<p>Made of red stone the moai topknots are gigantic weighing as much as 10 ton.</p>

<p><strong><em>Travelers Among Mountains and Streams</em></strong>, by artist <strong>Fan Kuan</strong> is a work comprised of <strong>ink and color on silk</strong>. It measures <strong>7 feet by 3 feet and 4 inches</strong>.</p>
<p>This work has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisp brushwork</li>
<li>Painting on silk</li>
<li>Height is emphasized by filling up the composition</li>
</ul>
<p>There are gaps between the foreground, middleground, and background. This suggests space in between. Negative space implies space is moving backwards and receding.</p>
<p>Scrolls were selected by artists based on color and texture and usually have the title up on the top right.</p>
<h5><strong>Style Features</strong></h5>
<p>There are<strong> six components</strong> that Fan Kuan was taught by his master, as were many <strong>literati.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit/vitality</li>
<li>Harmony/rhythm</li>
<li>Mental concentration</li>
<li>Scenery</li>
<li>Brushwork</li>
<li>Ink</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>What was the Function of a Scroll?</strong></h5>
<p>Scrolls were expensive, a <strong>sign of status</strong>, and something you would display to your guests. These artworks were not permanently displayed. They were meant to be admired and studied but carefully packed away.</p>
<p>One can study the image, meditate upon it and generally slow down. This provokes the same response as gazing at a beautiful vista would.</p>
<p>There is immensity of nature. Man is dwarfed by nature. There is also beauty in nature. Men can get lost in nature and revel at its immensity.</p>
<h5><strong>A Display of Daoist Attitude</strong></h5>
<p>Scrolls could also display the <strong>Daoist </strong>attitude of <strong>Yin and Yang</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daoism was popular amongst the elite</li>
<li><strong>Yin:</strong> female; dark; receptive; yielding; weak</li>
<li><strong>Yang:</strong> male; light; assertive; creative; strong</li>
<li>The interaction of these complementary ideas is necessary to natural order</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Content of </strong><strong><em>Travelers Among Mountains and Streams</em>.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>A group of travelers with pack mules travel through the mountainside and pass along a stream</li>
<li>Qualities of yin and yang
<ul>
<li>Some parts are empty and barren (yin), others are crowded and full (yang)</li>
<li>Mountains (yang) and sky (yin)</li>
<li>Water (yin) and sunlight (yang)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gritty mountainside takes up 2/3 of the picture</li>
<li>Based on real geological traits (vegetation tends to only grow in fine soil and mountains tend to have deep crevices)</li>
<li>This is probably a constructed landscape (this was not seen as a lie or fabrication, but rather that man could create a perfect landscape)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>During the chaos of the Five Kingdoms period (between the Tang and Song dynasties), many scholars and artists fled to the mountains. Known as <strong>literati</strong> these people were disenchanted with human affairs and turned towards nature.</p>
<p>Scenes that depicted majestic landscapes developed into an ironically popular style in urban China. China elevated landscape paintings to an important subject for art, hundreds of years before Western artists would.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fan Kuan</strong>, was an artist and a Daoist hermit, whom very little is known about. He is famous for landscapes in the Song period, and this is possibly his only surviving work.</p>

<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em> </strong>a set of two vases made from<strong> white porcelain with cobalt-blue underglaze </strong>each stand 2 feet tall<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a very specific kind of ceramic that is hard, white, brittle, and shiny. It gets the name from Marco Polo. Porcelain is close to the Italian name for a cowrie shell, and he thought it looked as shiny as a shell.</p>
<p><strong>Underglaze </strong>means the decoration is applied to the surface before it is glazed. This makes the decoration durable.</p>

<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> are one of the most famous cultural specimens of Chinese porcelain art. As part of the collection of Sir David Percival, they received the eponymous title! Sir Percival was known to possess a vast collection of Chinaware. He bought 1500 pieces of china during the Chinese Civil War, in the early 20th century, from Dowager Empress Cixi. She sold them to gain funds for the war.</p>
<p>The pair of artifacts <strong>exhibit a far eastern and middle eastern merger</strong> concerning the shape and the motifs they manifest. The viewer should deliberately focus on this aspect of <strong>cultural exchange</strong>. At the same time, they have an inscription on the neck, which stands out vividly. The inscription mentions the name and date of the artifact.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The two David Vases are <strong>identical with similar forms, colors, and materials</strong>. Made from porcelain, they are supposedly denoted to the deteriorated versions made in bronze, which was prevalent in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
<p>The identical vases possess the shape of an elongated vase with a handle on the neck above the shoulder. The form has a cylindrical base that tapers inwards to acquire a balanced grip on the ground. Above the same, two moldings create initial lower sections. The main body of the vase forms an arch near the shoulder, which concludes with molding. The elongated neck, a bit lesser than the length of the main body, joins to the thick rim, forming the head of the vase. The <strong>handles are shaped in the form of an elephant head and trunk on both sides.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2170" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/204-Close-UP.jpg?resize=643%2C459&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="643" height="459" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/204-Close-UP.jpg?w=311&amp;ssl=1 311w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/204-Close-UP.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The artisans, maintaining the minimalistic approach, have used <strong>blue pigment on the white porcelain</strong>. The <strong>design </strong>of the vases is a <strong>blend of animals and decorative foliage</strong>. The lower cylindrical body is divided into equal sections comprising <strong>symbolic motifs.</strong> The following section displays <strong>floral motifs</strong> while the main body has a <strong>single dragon</strong> with an undulating body covering the entire circumference. Following the molding with a decorative pattern, the first section has the form of <strong>a flying phoenix amidst clouds.</strong> Divided by protruding partitions, the upper neck section has a pattern of successively repetitive vertical leaves. The head of the vase shows alternating floral motifs with foliage.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> do not have a special function to serve because they were for the altar of a Daoist temple. However, they have a vivid inscription at the cusp of the shoulder and the neck above the band of the dragon. The inscription mentions the name of the official who commissioned these elegant pair of blue and white Chinese wares.</p>
<p>Porcelain was used to create the initial vases. They were then painted with blue pigment. Artists deglazed at the end, thereby increasing the longevity of the pigments. This process is called underglaze. Hence, the vases are still intact and continue to gleam the space.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Although the material of porcelain indicates the Chinese traditions, the visual elements are borrowed from the Middle eastern regions of art. The middle east Mesopotamia zone was an artistic hub that created many copper-inlaid-with-gold vases. The designs, apart from arabesque, also had human figures and inscriptions, which served as a document to the history of the ware. Hence, these traditions seemed to have penetrated in Chinese workshops with the Mongol invasion. The kingdom of Mongols had expanded over nearly all of Asia.</p>
<p>China was the lead producer of porcelain, and hence the products were typically known as chinaware. And, as it appears, the blue and white porcelain products are quintessentially Chinese. Some of the kilns made by China could reach 2200 Fahrenheit.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>Because of the easy to read and distinct inscription, we know that these vases were commissioned by Zhang Wenjin of Yushan county in 1351. Along with <strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong>, he also presented an incense burner to a Daoist temple in Xingyua (modern-day Wuyan county). Yushan county is situated 120 km from Jingdezhen, where the vases were apparently made.</p>
<p>The inscription descriptively mentions the professional background of Wenjin who was in the salt trade. He made these vases as an offering to the temple to appease the god for his sins. At the same time, he also wanted to protect his family from evil.</p>

<p>During this period of the 14th century, Mongols had captured the entire stretch of the middle east to the far east. This stimulated an enormous amount of exchange in art, culture, and commerce between the Yuan dynasty of China and the Ilkhan empire of Iran. The blue pigment or cobalt in chinaware was imported from the Iranian Ilkhan empire. At the same time, the form of the vases also reflects a similarity with the bronze vases, which was a popular art activity in the middle east. The motifs and the pattern were also a middle east influence.</p>

<p><strong><em>Forbidden City</em> </strong>located in<strong> Beijing, China </strong>is a stunning Chinese Palace made of<strong> stone masonry, marble, brick, wood, and ceramic tile. </strong>It sits in the center of the city<strong> on 178 acres.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the building is <strong>timber and brick</strong>, with sloping rooflines and <strong>glazed roof tiles. </strong>The emphasis is on traditional craftsmanship through the support of Chinese laborers. Tile roofs curve upward to allow light in and keep rain out.</p>
<p><strong>The Significance of Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Extensive use of <strong>the number 3</strong> and multiples of 3 are used throughout. There are <strong>three tiered roofs</strong>, and the <strong>staircases have 9 steps.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 3</strong> is associated with harmony between yin and yang</li>
<li><strong>Number 9</strong> is associated with divinity of emperor</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Meaning of Color</strong></h5>
<p>The use of color in the<strong> <em>Forbidden City</em> </strong>also has meaning. These are the four main colors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red</strong> represents the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> represents the earth.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong> represents the Heavens.</li>
<li><strong>White</strong> is a symbol of purity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>courtyard style residence</strong> uses a <strong>geometric organization</strong> of space that is aligned with the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>Outer court represented <strong>Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the South.</li>
<li>Belonged to realm of state affairs and only men had access to its spaces.</li>
<li>Included: emperor’s formal reception halls, places for religious rituals and state ceremonies.</li>
<li>Hall of Supreme Harmony represented central focus.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Inner court represented <strong>Heaven</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the North</li>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>Eastern and Western sides reserved for retired emperor and empress dowager</li>
<li>Also included <strong>Buddhist and Daoist temples</strong> building during Ming Dynasty</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>The symbolism shows the relationship between Heaven and Earth. Emperor is the Son of Heaven and can mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>Power is conveyed visually and there is a spatial representation of power. This shows the emperor’s power over laws and regulations since he can regulate and reorganize nature.</p>
<p>The architects followed ideal cosmic order and social hierarchy in Confucianism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The complex was to showcase Yongle’s magnificence during turbulent years after the overthrow of his nephew. It was a visual assertion of imperial power with ceremonial space, ritual space and living space.</p>
<p>It was named the <strong><em>Forbidden Palace</em></strong> because only royal court could enter.</p>
<p>The complex was a political and ritual center for China for 500+ years. It was a place of power and propaganda that legitimized rulers and became visual evidence for the Mandate of Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 North Gate (Gate of Divine Might)</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some key points about the <strong>North Gate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walls are 30 feet high to keep people out</li>
<li>Designed to withstand cannons</li>
<li>Gate from which troops would often leave</li>
<li>3 openings: middle one was reserved for the emperor only</li>
<li>Heavily guarded day and night</li>
</ul>

<figure id="attachment_2045" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2045" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2045" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/206.2.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/206.2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/206.2.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2045" class="wp-caption-text">Front Gate<br />© John Lander Photography</figcaption></figure>
<p>This gate has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five entryways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest in the center was used as passage for Ming and Qing emperors.</li>
<li>The side ones are smaller and were used for officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-eaved roof is guarded by two pairs of <strong>Ming stone lions.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Mao Zedong</strong></h5>
<p>Today the gate is characterized by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong weighing 1.5 tons. Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two placards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: Long Live the People’s Republic of China</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrases have significant meaning as <strong>“Long Live”</strong> was reserved for Emperors of China. But afterward it was available to common people because Mao had liberated it…just like Forbidden City!</p>
<p>In 1989, three dissidents attacked the portrait with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests. They were sent to prison for 17 years (released 2006).</p>

<p><strong>The Northeastern section </strong>was a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. He planned to retire and abdicate, then settle down in modest quarters here, along with his major art collection.</p>
<p>This part of the complex is called the <strong>Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service</strong> and this room is the theater room. The layout mirrors the arrangement of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The finest craftsmen of the day spent <strong>five years building</strong> just this palace. He never spent a night here.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the palace was chained shut and largely forgotten. It has now been restored to what was imagined it would have been like.</p>
<p>If he didn’t sleep here, what did he do here?</p>
<p>There were <strong>gardens, banquet rooms, prayer halls</strong>, an <strong>opera house,</strong> and a <strong>theater room</strong>. It was a place to <strong>meditate, write poetry</strong>, and <strong>enjoy company of concubines.</strong></p>
<p>It was a simple rectangular room with translucent <strong>embroidered scenes</strong>, <strong>jade-inlaid wall hangings</strong> and <strong>Chinese carved decoration. </strong>There were also panoramic <strong>murals painted on silk</strong>, <strong>wisteria painted on ceilings</strong>, along with <strong>magpies flying over the tiled rooves</strong> of the palace. This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l’oeil</strong>). This was a testament to the emperor’s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.</p>
<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ming</strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant</strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.</p>
<p>The construction of the Forbidden city was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son’s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).</p>
<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.  The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China</p>
<h5><strong>Forbidden City Imperial Power and Authority</strong></h5>
<p>How can we attribute the art-historical period during which the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> was constructed? How do both the plan and the architecture demonstrate the culture and/or patron&#8217;s function and/or purpose of the structure?</p>
<p><strong>The Forbidden City </strong>designates the Beijing palace of the Chinese emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties who ruled China from the 15th century until the early 20th century<strong>. </strong>The planning of the imperial palace took place during the reign of the 3rd Qing Emperor Yongle and it was done according to the Chinese traditions.</p>
<p><strong>The city was rectangular</strong> just like the world according to Chinese traditions and its name “Purple City” corresponded to the central star of the Chinese sky the “small purple star” (the Western Polar star).</p>
<p>The plan and the architecture of the city <strong>reflect the ideal cosmic order in Confucian ideology</strong>. The imperial palace was planned on a north-south axis, with a parade avenue which crossed the whole city and connected the gates. The first two gates, the Meridian and Supreme Harmony Gates open to courtyards. The palace rules emphasized the segregation according to rank to <strong>underline the authority of the emperor.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Meridien Gate had 5 Portals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The central gate was reserved for the emperor.</li>
<li>The other middle gates were reserved for family and officials</li>
<li>The outermost gates were used for servants.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>second courtyard leads to three halls</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the Hall of Supreme Harmony, </strong></li>
<li>the Hall of Central Harmony, and</li>
<li>the Hall of Protecting Harmony.</li>
</ul>
<p>These halls belonged to realm of state affairs and were reserved to men. They are elevated on a monumental three-tiered white marble terrace. Their tiled roofs are two-tiered and their wooden eaves are painted in intricate patterns all demonstrating the power and authority of the emperor. The <strong>roofs are yellow which is the imperial color</strong>. Their ridges are <strong>decorated with animal ornaments and heavenly guardians</strong> and the more important the building, the greater the number of clay figures.</p>
<p>The <strong>roof of the Hall of Harmony is crowned with two huge dragon ornaments</strong> weighing almost 4 tones each. Here is where the dragon throne was located. The <strong>dragon symbolized the power of the emperor</strong>.</p>
<p>The three Halls are the last buildings in which officials had access. The rest of the city was reserved for the imperial family, which earned it the nickname of <strong>Forbidden City. </strong></p>
<p>The segregation from commoners and officials was complete and <strong>emphasized the divine role and duty of the emperor</strong>. Symbolically the outer South court represented Earth, and the inner Northern court represented Heaven. Only the Emperor as the Son of Heaven and could mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>The main palaces of the private quarters, the emperor’s Palace of Heavenly Purity, Hall of Union and empress Palace of Earthly Tranquility are also elevated. Most have two-tiered roofs and intricate caisson ceilings. The <strong>symbolism of the dragons</strong> continues in the inner court with the Nine Dragons tiled screen of the retired emperor palace.</p>
<p>The <strong>grandeur of the inner court surpasses the one of the outer court</strong>. The Palace of Heavenly Purity was so large and inconvenient for daily life that after Kangxi, the emperors chose to reside in a smaller Hall quoting their filial piety towards the greatest of the Chinese emperors.</p>

Interpretation of history</p>
<p><strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em> </strong>was made by an<strong> unknown artist </strong>but<strong> based on an oil painting by Liu Chunhua. </strong>This<strong> color lithograph </strong>produced in the late 1960s<strong> measures 2 feet by 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>The work features a <strong>low horizon line</strong> to enlarge the figure and <strong>atmospheric perspective.</strong></p>
<p>It is painted with <strong>Western realism</strong> as it is <strong>modeled</strong>, in <strong>3D</strong>, has <strong>precision</strong>, and <strong>accuracy with form. </strong>There is realism of fabric, body, and landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Mao</strong> is idealized, luminous, lighter than the background so he stands out. When this painting was first made, he was in his 70s, but he appears much younger.</p>
<p>As for colors there is no use of traditional reds. Instead, <strong>purples, greens, browns are used</strong>. The symbolic colors were abandoned for realistic colors.</p>
<h5><strong>All About Color Lithographs</strong></h5>
<p>When an image is popular artists want to make prints of it for reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw image the with and oily crayon on a flat stone</li>
<li>Cover the stone with water. It is repelled from the oily crayon.</li>
<li>Cover the plate with oil-based ink. It is repelled from the places where the water was and latches onto the oily crayon.</li>
<li>Press the paper down on top. Apply pressure</li>
<li>To make a color lithograph, you would need multiple stones – one for each color.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended to be <strong>propaganda, emotionally moving </strong>and present an <strong>interpretation of history</strong>. It was made when Mao was not in a position of strength. He has found himself in this trouble because of the failure of the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>The point of this work was to help Mao regain power and mend the country. This was to convince others that Mao could lead the country again, like he had through the revolution, despite the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>The emphasize was on Mao’s grassroots beginnings and his inherent strength. It shows him as a revolutionary who was committed to championing the common people and doing what was right by addressing the lives of the working class.</p>
<p>This work was described by Communist party officials as a “model work”.</p>
<p>Mao looks the heroic, ennobled, aggrandized leader, who is honorable, successful, and determined.</p>
<p>The image was widely published in newspapers and journals, as well as reproduced in the form of posters, statues, and kitchenware. Some believe there were more than <strong>900 million copies</strong> made.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The strike hasn’t happened yet. He is brave because this is the dawn of a new day.</li>
<li>Heroic pose as he strides forward among lush fields.</li>
<li>The winds of change literally blow through the valley.</li>
<li>Chinese landscape now serves a new purpose – it shows the struggle of the common man and the beauty of China’s people.</li>
<li>Telephone pole in the distance associates Mao with technology.</li>
<li>Umbrella tucked beneath one arm, hand in a fist – he is superhuman, charismatic, determined, practical.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>In the early 1920s, Mao and other communists helped guide the 13,000 miners’ <strong>strike at the Anyuan Coal Mine</strong> to protest the treatment of workers and demand higher wages.</p>
<p>This resulted in higher wages, better conditions, an education program, and widespread support for the Communists. Mao emerged as one of the most significant and well-liked leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Mao ruled from 1949 – 1976.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Leap Forward (1958 – 1962) </strong>was Mao’s plan to industrialize China while maintaining the basic agricultural/pastoral structure of China. The “solution” was to have farmers create steel mills in their backyards. Millions died as not enough food was produced, steel mills caught fire and many other catastrophes. The plan backfires tremendously</p>
<p><strong>Mao’s Cultural Revolution of 1966</strong> continued for a few more years as a reaction to Mao realizing he was on the brink of losing power. Mao tried to turn frustration towards him into frustration towards the traditions of Chinese culture. Mao argued that his plan would have worked had it not been for Chinese traditions that stood in the way.</p>
<p>Mao mobilized peasants <strong>(Red Army)</strong> and together <strong>they tortured</strong> traditional artists, scholars, and professors, while they <strong>destroyed </strong>thousands of books, historical objects, and artworks (<strong>anything Confucian or Buddhist they could get their hands on).</strong></p>
<p>Mao encouraged artists to create “art for the people” that would convey communist ideas in ways accessible to the masses. Realistic images of workers, soldiers, and peasants began to replace traditional ink/silk images of landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Liu Chunhua’s</strong> image was painted in 1969 in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. Liu Chunhua was a member of the Red Guard.</p>

<p><strong>Gold and Jade Crown </strong>is a<strong> metalwork </strong>object<strong>, </strong>worn on the forehead, that<strong> measures 1 foot and 4 inches. </strong>The crown is lavish with ornamentation and elongated branch-like protrusions from which tiny <strong>gold discs</strong> and <strong>jade ornaments</strong> are attached.</p>
<p>The crown required very delicate and precise hammering as gold is a soft metal and jade is a hard material.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Works such as these were found in <strong>burials</strong> for royalty. Initially, historians believed this to be the sole purpose. Objects that were important in life were taken to the grave, but these crowns were also used in special and occasional <strong>ceremonial rites</strong> of the Silla royalty.</p>
<p>Silla used <strong>shamanistic practices</strong> in their ceremonies where Kings and Queens were significant players. The gold indicated the power of the wearer. A crown is also a visual marker of status.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols and Meanings</strong></h5>
<p>Three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke a sacred tree that once stood. It is believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi. </strong>Jade ornaments symbolized ripe fruit hanging from the tree branches as <strong>fertility and abundance. </strong>The antlers symbolized the power and speed of a deer. It is a sacred animal in Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries, Korea was divided into three kingdoms, with the <strong>Silla kingdom</strong> being the most powerful and wealthiest of all three.</p>
<p>Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced <strong>shamanism</strong>. This is a type of nature worship which requires the expertise or mediation of a figure called a shaman who can facilitate communication between the gods and people. In shamanism gods control nature. Humans are at the mercy of nature. The shaman intervenes on behalf of the people.</p>
<h5><strong>The Glitter of Gold</strong></h5>
<p>Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as <strong>a country of gold</strong>. Silla kings began to associate with gold and use it to identify royalty.</p>
<p>Silla was particularly famous for its craftsmen and items created out of gold. Through collections unearthed in Silla tombs historians have determined that kings and queens lived in large royal palaces, and wore robes of pure silk embellished with gold, as well as <strong>belts and crowns of solid gold</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2175" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Korean-Royalty.jpg?resize=388%2C521&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="388" height="521" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Korean-Royalty.jpg?w=388&amp;ssl=1 388w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Korean-Royalty.jpg?resize=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1 223w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Jewelry was part of the ensemble with <strong>earrings, rings for every finger, and armloads of bracelets</strong> crafted in gold. Royalty sat down to lavish meals that were served in <strong>gold and silver vessels</strong> and plated on <strong>gold plates</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>earliest golden objects</strong> unearthed were in the Wolseng-ro Tomb in Gyeongju. It was constructed in the last quarter of the fourth century. <strong>Two large pendants were found</strong> made of pure gold. At the top are gold hoops, from which fall long chains, embellished with delicate pieces of gold. Historians believe these were hung from a headband on either side of the forehead.</p>
<p>Later, <strong>six royal mound tombs provided further insight into the lives of the Silla royals</strong>. Dating back to the early Silla period, between the first quarter of the 5<sup>th</sup> to the first quarter of the 6<sup>th</sup> century the tombs each contained a royal golden crown. Hwangnam Daechong, a tomb measuring 80 meters in diameter had a crown with a matching belt, necklaces, rings, earrings, and vessels all made from gold. The fact that royal deceased were buried with the gold objects shows the high regard the Silla people had for the precious metal.</p>
<h5><strong>Two Types of Crowns</strong></h5>
<p>Two types of crowns were discovered.</p>
<p>The first is the <strong>conical cap</strong> (magwan), a small hat worn over a topknot. Originally, these were made of birch wood and crafted into a cone shape. Conical caps were worn on the head and strapped below the chin. Fine silk fabric was placed over top, with precious metal objects attached. These crowns did not survive, but the ornamentation did, allowing for historians to reconstruct what the crowns would have looked like.</p>
<p>The southern mound at Hwangnam contained a magwan made of silver and gilt bronze. There were also decorative elements to adorn it including a gold winged object, measuring just over 16 inches high and gold rectangular plates with discs of gold circles hanging from wires. Each of the rectangles measure just over 3 inches each.  While nearby at the Geumgwachong Tomb or Gold Crown Tomb, a golden magwan crown was unearthed, measuring 7 inches high.</p>
<p>The second type of crown is the <strong>daewag or headband</strong> style from which vertical elements hang down. These crowns are made from thin gold sheets and lined with fabric, to provide the skin with comfort. In the early stages the daewag was made of a high purity gold with a minimum of decoration. Later the crowns became highly decorative but were crafted from lower purity gold.</p>
<h5><strong>Belts</strong></h5>
<p>Gold belts were another symbol of Silla royalty. These were crafted from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leather bands</li>
<li>Gold plaques</li>
<li>Pendants</li>
</ul>
<p>The plaques were linked together and contained engravings of dragons, phoenixes and palmettes. Heart shaped gold charms were attached to the plaques.</p>
<p>Pendants also held charms such as knives, tweezers, medicine bottles, fish, and jade pieces.</p>
<h5><strong> More About Royalty: Queen Seondeok&#8217;s Reign in Silla Korea </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Under the Reign of Korean’s First Female Sovereign Silla Experienced a Flourish of Arts and Science</strong></p>
<p>The ancient Kingdom of Silla was ruled by a woman from 632 to 647 CE. Her name was Queen Seondeok, and she was Korea’s very first female sovereign.</p>
<p>The queen’s father King Jinpyeong ruled for an impressive 53 years between 579-632 CE. He had no male heir, and the crown was passed on to his daughter. When she took the throne, she also took the word <strong>wang</strong> or <strong>king</strong>—just like the queens in Egypt had before her.  Seondeok was the Silla’s 27<sup>th</sup> ruler. She inherited a prosperous fortune. Compassionately her first objective was to help the poor in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Seondeok </strong>was also a fighter. She refused to give up land the Silla owned. She sent a 10, 000-man army to rescue the famous general Kin Yu-Sin. He was being held by rival King Bojang of Gogurye for ransom.  The demand was for <strong>Seondeok</strong> to give up territory the Silla has taken. Seeing the fierce army, the king released the general immediately!</p>
<p>Silla’s neighbors were not without power. The queen had already established trading and cultural ties with the Tang Court of China. The two states formed an army. Yet, warring in Korea continued until 668 CE after the queen’s rule had ended.</p>

<p><strong>During her time Buddhism grew increasingly popular.  </strong>The queen saw an extensive building program especially when it came to Buddhist temples. While these were made of wood and did not survive, examples of stone pagodas still do.</p>
<p>The most notable work is the granite built <strong>Cheomseongdae</strong> observatory in Gyeongju, the Silla capital. It stands<strong> 9 meters high</strong>. The blocks are large rectangles set in a circular formation, forming a bottle like shape.</p>
<p>There is a window with 12 layers of bricks below it and 12 layers of bricks above it. The sun’s rays are captured during the spring and summer equinoxes, given its south facing views.  It was <strong>initially thought that the building functioned as a sundial</strong>, as astronomy and astrology were important parts of Korean society that helped with agriculture. It also lent authority to rulers as the chosen ones.</p>
<p>Another theory is that <strong>Cheomseongdae </strong>was meant as a replica of Mount Sumeru, the holy Buddhist mountain. This would indicate the sight was a place to worship and pray. The female like form could also mean that it was built to represent the Ishtar/Inanna who was connected to the heavens. One final theory is that it was suppose to represent the Queen herself.</p>
<h5><strong>Hwangnyongsa Temple</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hwangnyongsa Temple is a Buddhist temple</strong> which translates into English as <strong>Temple of the Illustrious Dragon,</strong> also in Gyeongju. Myth has it that a yellow dragon was spotted at this exact location, symbolizing the defeat of all enemies of Silla.</p>
<p>The project began with the breaking of the ground by King Jinheung, in 553 CE. The site measured 280 by 280 meters, with a huge Buddha at a height of 4 meters. The queen added a nine-story pagoda for which she hired master architect Abiji from Baekje. It also included a massive bell. Everything was destroyed by the Mongols in 1238 CE, but the foundation remains for visitors to see.</p>
<h5><strong>Death of the Queen</strong></h5>
<p>Not everyone agreed Seondeok should rule. Fuming aristocrats thought the throne should now be granted to someone outside of the bloodline. A rebellion ensued, that was thwarted by general Kin Yu-Sin and the queen’s nephew.</p>
<p>She would later die of illness and was entombed within the sacred mountain of Nangsan, Gyeongju.</p>
<h5><strong>The Second Queen</strong></h5>
<p><strong>After the rule of Queen </strong>Seondeok, her cousin Jindeok (r. 647-654 CE) took the throne. She would further help Silla dominate the Korean peninsula.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Goryeong Sin Family Collection in Korea</p>
<p><strong>Portrait of Sin Sukju</strong> from the <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> is a hanging scroll made from <strong>ink and color on silk. The work </strong>measures<strong> 5 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches.</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Korean portraiture conventions, court artists painted subjects in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-length view</li>
<li>¾ turn</li>
<li>Only one ear showing</li>
<li>With crisp angular lines</li>
<li>Little to no modeling; mostly using lines to show folds of fabric or skin</li>
<li>Highly controlled brushwork</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This hanging scroll was meant <strong>to be displayed</strong>. Silk is a sign of <strong>status.</strong></p>
<p>Sin Sukju (1417-1475) is depicted as a “meritorious subject” and celebrated as Prime Minister. He was an official honored for his distinguished service at court and his loyalty to the king. These types of portraits were common for government workers.</p>
<p>These portraits were cherished by families and worshipped for generations. This is similar to Head of Roman Patrician with a focus on ancestral rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju is dressed in his official robes, with a black silk hat on his head.  He is shown as a Neoconfucian scholar. He sits with his hands folded neatly and concealed within his sleeves. Excessive fabric is a sign of wealth (think of Arnolfini Portrait!).</p>
<p>He wears a rank badge on his chest that was typically made of embroidered silk. This indicates the status of the official which ranged from emperor to local official. Images of birds identified rank. Sin Sukju’s badge shows a pair of peacocks amongst flowers and clouds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju was Prime Minister from 1461 – 1464, and again through 1471 – 1475.</p>
<p>The <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> was trained to capture the likeness of sitters, while adhering to pictorial conventions for illustrating government members. Imperial Bureau was the government school of artists that standardized painted images. Since images were so standardized, artists likely specialized in one area such as the face, hands, or robe.</p>
<p><strong>Sinification</strong> refers to the diffusion of Chinese culture to other regions. Koreans adopted not only Confucianism but also traditions of Chinese paintings. This was a sign of cross-culturation.</p>
<p>Notice the painting of a Chinese bureaucrat on the left</p>

<h5><strong>Contextual History</strong></h5>
<p>In 1800 &#8211; 1200 B.C. the Aryans arrived from the north. Then, <strong>Hinduism began</strong>. There was no founder and no set of tenets. As a polytheistic faith, there are hundreds, even thousands, of gods. This is a complex religion with practices, schools and beliefs. It is a life devoted to prayer, devotion and good deeds.</p>
<p>In the 6<sup>th</sup> century BCE, <strong>Siddhartha Gautama founded Buddhism.</strong> This became the dominant religion of Southeast Asia. Buddha is not a god but an example of leading an ascetic life. Buddhists believe a life of suffering ends when rebirth ends and the soul achieves nirvana.</p>
<p>Common symbols include the lion (as Buddha was royalty), the wheel (law) and lotus (purity)</p>
<h5><strong>Target Concepts </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Religions rooted in the East seek <strong>an end or escape from the karmic cycle or reincarnation</strong>.</li>
<li>Buddhism begins in India but spreads throughout the East.</li>
<li>Artistic and architectural styles were influenced by Buddhism.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction </strong>is frequently the answer when a culture wishes to depict the supernatural</li>
<li><strong>Iconography </strong>coveys messages in Eastern Art</li>
<li>Eastern Art has its own styles that differs from Western Art.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>An Influence of Artistic Styles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Military conquest</li>
<li>the Silk Road</li>
<li>Colonialism</li>
<li>Trade in Buddhist Art</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> in <strong>Khajuraho, India</strong>, is built from <strong>sandstone</strong> and stands <strong>85 feet high.</strong>  It is one of the ancient Hindu shrines of India. Located inside the native of Khajurao, in central India, they are famous for their incredibly beautiful erotic sculptures, displaying several sex positions in the most sensual form. One of the finest specimens of temple architecture, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is made in a <strong>Nagara style architecture of northern India.</strong></p>

<p>Despite many foreign invasions, the temple has survived the wrath of time. The well-carved columns, plinth, walls, sanctum, and halls are worth noticing. They are living proof of <strong>semantic Indian art</strong> and expert <strong>craftsmanship of Indian artists</strong>.</p>

<p>Males and females locked in sexual positions portray the deep knowledge that ancient Indian sages had regarding lovemaking as a concept of attaining spiritual bliss. Moreover, artists have sculpted human figures with accurate anatomy, denoting the system of research prevalent among the guilds. Owing to the temple being extant, the architecture and stone masonry are exceptional.</p>
<p>In the past, Indian art is an embodiment of abstract and manifest. The manifest forms through temple architecture represent life and its eventual surrender to the higher consciousness by refining the senses.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is a part of a bigger complex with many other shrines in Khajurao, a native village in central India. When it was built in the 10th century AD, more than 80 temples were constructed. These were destroyed by Sultanate rulers, post-12-13th centuries. Presently, less than 25 temples are extant, remembering the ancient artistic legacy.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2035" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2035" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-D.png?resize=900%2C607&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="900" height="607" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2035" class="wp-caption-text">Lakshmana Temple plan</figcaption></figure>
<p>Built on the raised platform, plinth or <em>jagati</em>, the central shrine of <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is surrounded by four smaller shrines, constructed in the same style. This pattern is known as Panchayantana in Indian doctrines. Notably, this structure reminds us of four minarets surrounding the famous mausoleum, Taj Mahal by Shah Jahan. The function served is quite contradictory in the case of this Hindu temple. As it is a Nagara-style temple, it comprises the main space called <em>garbha griha</em> or sanctum, which houses the god-statue of <strong>Lord Vaikunth Vishnu</strong>. It is a small, windowless, and no-contact, sacred space, where most priests are allowed to perform routine rituals.</p>

<p><strong>Vishnu</strong> is one of the main gods of the Hindu pantheon, which <strong>symbolizes preservation and protection</strong>. The cult of Vishnu in India is known as Vaishnavite. <strong>Mentioned in the Vedas</strong>, he is a Vedic god and thus had a large following throughout the continent of India since the ancient past. Most importantly, Vishnu is the god who regularly incarnates on the earth whenever there arises a great force of evil.</p>
<p>Vishnu appeared on the earth through ten reincarnations which consist of popular gods like Rama, Krishna, Parshurama, among six others. In addition, Vishnu also appears in a variety of other divine forms, among which Vaikunth Vishnu is also a significant one. The god with three heads and four hands, is a powerful emblem of taking charge of the preservation of life and beings. The three heads represent three combined incarnations viz. Narsimha, Varaha and Saumya.</p>
<p>Facing east, the <strong>garbha griha</strong> is enclosed in a tall spire structure called <strong>vimana.</strong> Tapering at the top, the <strong>vimana </strong>symbolizes refinement of human senses to achieve supreme bliss and union with God. The sanctum connects to an alley called <strong>antarala</strong>, which is a connecting bridge to the sacred space with a secular one.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>The sacred space of <strong>garbha griha</strong> opens to a hall with many decorative columns, in hypostyle format, which is called <strong>mandapa</strong>.</p>
<p>There are categories to <strong>mandapa,</strong> which comprise <strong>ardhamandapa</strong> and <strong>sabhamandapa</strong>,<em> </em>concerning the performed activities. These activities include religious duties, chanting, singing hymns in the praise of gods and goddesses, among others. <strong>Mandapa</strong><em> </em>is a secular space, where every layman is allowed to visit and pray.</p>
<p>The interior of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is made with corbeled arch, a style of overlapping masonry, which is pressured on the ground for stability. This is known as <strong>Ashlar masonry</strong> with stones fitted using rivets instead of mortar or nails. Artists have used <strong>horror vacui</strong>, defining the profuse decoration on the outside walls. Significantly, the southern walls of the temple show intimate sexual poses of a male-female union.</p>
<p>The temple sculpture in ancient India followed the aesthetics of <strong>rasa</strong> (acquiring relish) and <strong>Taalmana</strong><em> </em>(proportion) to create evocative artworks. Hence, the figures are curvy, tall, slender, and extremely rhythmic. Moreover, they are lyrical, moving the gaze subtly and effectively. Artists were able to achieve this remarkable feat of precision because of <strong>sandstone, which is soft and workable</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2034" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2034" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?resize=750%2C502&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="502" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2034" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />© Michele Burgess/Alamy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from erotic couples called <strong>mithuna,</strong> there are high reliefs of over 600 gods from Hindu pantheons. The short capitals show the form of lions, while before a devotee circumambulates the temple, the statue of Lord Ganesha assures of the correct revolving path. Significantly, in India, Lord Ganesha is worshipped by all creeds before initiating a new chapter of life. The human figurines are adorned with many accessories denoting royalness.</p>
<p>The interior of the Lakshmana Temple is equally decorated with the narration of the lives of gods. Incarnations of Vishnu, Krishna Leela (tale), among many other narrative panels enliven the temple with the traditional culture of India. Based on Indian aesthetic theories, the placement of sculptures allots figures of speech (<em>alamkara</em>) quality. Hence, they suggest an abstract philosophy over describing it through inscriptions. The aesthetics of suggestions in Indian aesthetic theory is called <em>dhvani</em>. Through love-making scenes on the temple, the importance of sex as a means to higher consciousness is emphasized by the ruling dynasty of Chandella.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Primarily, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple serves as the worshipping place of Lord Vishnu</strong>. The Hindu temples are deemed as a residing space for the god among the common masses. Visiting the temple, the devotee circumambulates the shrine to activate the divine energy and pay symbolic reverence and dedication. Most importantly, they should circumambulate in a clockwise direction.</p>
<p>The Chandella kingdom followed the Vaishnaivite cult and to address social legitimacy, they built many temples. It also showed their piety. With respect to political agenda, they would often borrow the model of deity from the neighboring kingdom to maintain the cordial relation. In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple,</strong> king Yashovarman had followed the same method. However, it is stated that the present idol in the temple is not an original one.</p>
<p>Rulers are depicted in tantric sex poses, which were seen as a kind of offering to the deities. The theme of the building is preservation (this is what Vishnu embodies): whether it be sexual prolonging or preservation of human life (through reproduction).</p>
<p>The ancient Indian temples are solid proof of profound study, which are documented in the doctrines called <strong>shastras.</strong> From the studies in the science of construction to the study of making love is practically demonstrated and celebrated in these documents.</p>
<p>With respect to the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, the legacy of architecture and art is combined with tantric philosophy, which presents a spiritual significance to sex. According to Tantrism, the union of the male and female body develops proximity with god.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Shilpashashtra and Kamasutra are ancient Indian texts on the art of sculpting and lovemaking, respectively. The main architect of the temple is known as Sutradhar or a Vishwakarma, a person who designs and directs the construction. Indian traditional doctrines are also replete with information to plan the building, as well as instructions to create a sculpture concerning the essential aesthetics. These structures of information have proven to be textbooks to the generation of artists in making high-relief or free-standing sculptures. Majorly, the narratives have been borrowed from ancient texts like Vedas, Puranas, and epics.</p>
<p>Presenting a Vaikunth Vishnu idol in the sanctum, the Chandela kings propagated Vaisnavism. However, they also promoted Jainism and had also supported the construction of Jain temples.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>Yashvoraman, a Chandella king, in 930 AD, augmented the construction of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, which eventually was completed during his son’s rule. A guild of artists was employed to finish the massive plan of the temple. Concerning the ruler’s desire to stand it out from the rest, a few changes were observed.</p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, the notion of sculpting erotic poses on the junctures was novel and performed for the first time. It is an example of using one of the figures of speech (<em>alamkara</em>) called <em>slesha </em>or pun. The temple was and is open to the visitors to seek the blessings of the preserver deity, Vishnu. It is one of the world heritage sites of India.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>Lakshmana temple was constructed between 930 &#8211; 1050 CE. Yashovarman of the Chandella dynasty built many temples in Khajurao with an exemplary amount of exterior as well as interior decoration. Thus, it initiated the nomenclature of Chandela art and architecture with specific significance. Moreover, Khajurao was the capital of the kingdom that boasts many cultural sites.</p>
<p>During the 10th century AD, the history of India had witnessed many falls and the rise of successful empires. Thus, the heritage was becoming predominant had followed a set of established rules. Many other kingdoms prevailed with final successive rules of Pala kingdom in the east and Chola kingdom in the south, among others, who proved great patronage to art and architecture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance</em></strong><em> </em>or the famous <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong><em> </em>sculpture epitomizes the manifestation of divine and cosmic energy. It is an absolute artistic representation of the <strong>golden age of sculpture in India</strong> and made from <strong>bronze</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p>The viewer must train the eye to look beyond the mere dancing pose and try and grasp the deeper meanings of symbolic gestures and forms. Although <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> is shown in an effeminate dancing pose, it is a <strong>symbiotic form of male and female energy</strong>. With one leg lifted, knee bent, and a hand crossing over the chest, the lyrical composition brings attention to the cosmic rhythm of the universe.</p>
<p>Etymologically, in Nataraja, <em>nat </em>means dance, and <em>raja </em>denotes the king. <strong><em>Narteswar</em></strong> and <strong><em>Natesa</em></strong> are two other names attributed to this sculpture.</p>
<p>As one of the Hindu pantheon’s top three gods, <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> is mentioned as a destroyer of the world, wherein he serves as an agent to initiate the process of new creation. That is why he is <strong>one of the most revered gods in India</strong>. Presenting primordial rhythm and sound, Natraja or Shiva as Lord of Dance amplifies two critical events of universal life: <strong>birth and death</strong>. As he performs the dance called <strong>Tandava,</strong> he is annihilating the present world with utmost calm composure.</p>
<p>As the most popular Indian sculpture, an emblem of worship and religiosity, <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> <strong>symbolizes fearlessness, the defeat of evil, peace, wisdom, and immense knowledge</strong>. A cultural motif, different regions and timelines have depicted the Natraja in various styles, each showing a different number of hands of Shiva.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visual Elements</strong></h5>
<p>Each motif or the form in the Natraja is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2084" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?resize=875%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="875" height="567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?w=875&amp;ssl=1 875w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?resize=768%2C498&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The arch surrounding the Shiva shows flames that originate from the mouth of the creature called <strong>Makara</strong>, a mythical sea creature, at the base. Thus, the encircling <strong>nimbus represents</strong> a cosmic circle of fire. This denotes the never-ending cycle of creation and destruction—a cogent Hindu belief. This nimbus or halo is known as the <em>Prabha mandala</em>. Interestingly, the earlier Natraja idols had an arch while later transformed into a fully circular halo. As he is ecstatically dancing, the flying locks of Shiva fan around, touching the nimbus.</p>
<p>The <strong>headdress</strong> consists of a skull, and a flower named Datura metel, denoting death as the ultimate truth and fragrance of life, respectively. Mounted with a crescent moon and the goddess <strong>Ganga</strong>, it indicates a peaceful state of mind despite the impending termination of life that everyone is destined to.</p>
<p>According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was brought to earth from heaven by Shiva, to save the world from drought. It is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.</p>
<p><strong>Shiva has four hands</strong>, which either carry some symbolic object or depict a hand pose called <strong><em>mudra</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2085" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=528%2C621&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="528" height="621" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=871%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 871w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=768%2C903&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?w=921&amp;ssl=1 921w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upper right hand</strong> holds a drum, called <strong><em>Damaru</em></strong><u>,</u>which continues beating over time. Like a ticking clock, it symbolizes the primordial sound of regular and many creations and annihilations.</li>
<li>The <strong>lower right-hand</strong> palm is raised, known as <strong><em>abhaya </em></strong>mudra, signifying fearlessness towards evil. The same hand has a cobra wrapped around the wrist, designating fear, danger, and turmoil. Yet, the lord is unperturbed.</li>
<li>The <strong>upper left-hand</strong> holds <strong>agni</strong> (fire), an important element for the act of creation as well as destruction.</li>
<li>Crossing his chest, the <strong>lower left-hand</strong> hides the heart of the Shiva. It is known as <strong><em>tirodhaana</em></strong>, meaning concealment. The same hand points to the left foot.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva possesses three eyes</strong>. Inclusive of the third eye on the forehead, is an inner eye that opens a vast pool of inherent knowledge and wisdom. Adorned with accessories like a bracelet and necklace, the loincloth also blows with the vigorous movement of dance, touching the halo. Shiva stands one-footed on the dwarf demon names Apasmara Purusha, which exemplifies ignorance and illusion.</p>
<p>Most importantly, throughout all of this, Shiva continues to remain patient and peaceful, projecting the idea of control or <strong><em>sayyam</em></strong><em> </em>in the act. Hence, the sculpture is an eye opener in the chaotic world, where we tend to forget the higher purpose of life, while following a dogmatic routine.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> is a cult statue dedicated to Lord Shiva, a prominent Hindu god. One of the oldest religions of India, Hinduism had been a pivotal belief in addressing the meanings of icons used in art forms. The doctrine Shilpashastra is the most important in ancient Indian literature that compulsively dominates the form, style, and composition of early Indian sculpture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> condenses the ancient iconography of India, embodying the divine. It was created to anesthetize the laws of the universe into a narrative that can relate as well as connect to the common mass. It emulates the dancing form from the doctrine called Natyashastra, a book of theatre. Thus, it was a cult statue throughout the sub-religions of India.</p>
<p>The sculpture of Shiva was first made <strong>in a dancing pose</strong> for temples during the 5th and 6th century CE as relief sculptures. The free-standing sculpture began to be made in the 10th century and <strong>preferably in bronze</strong>.</p>
<p>Around the 11th century, Nataraja statues were carried in processional parades, comprising priests and devotees. As a concept of commemoration, the Natraja idols would be <strong>covered with red and green cloth, surrounded by candles and flowers</strong>. The presence of the god in the statue, or deifying the idol, comes into being when a devotee worships it with immense faith.</p>
<p>Indian art was based on the fundamental principles of art and aimed at evoking the inherent emotion <strong>(bhava)</strong> of the art piece into the audience called <strong>rasa</strong>. The experience of expected <strong>rasa</strong> in the viewers is the marker of the successful artwork. Hence, developing an enormous reverence to the holy process of annihilation, which will inevitably become the ground of creation, Natraja follows this indoctrinated philosophy of art sincerely.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Composed in a balanced format, this bronze sculpture is from the Chola dynasty of the 10th century. The Chola artist employed the <strong>lost wax process</strong> or Cire perdue technique of casting. Hence<strong><em>, Natraja</em></strong> is also created with the same process. The cire perdue entails a long process of forming a wax model to prepare a core around it and pouring the molten metal either to produce a hollow or a solid cast.</p>
<p>During the Chola period, bronze casting was in vogue, which is proved by a range of artifacts of a variety of Indian gods available in diverse collections. Significantly, these sculptures project stone temple carvings&#8217; style along with the iconographical features, which purports a commendable merger of technique and aesthetics. With the instruction from Shilpashastra, the <em>talman </em>or the proportion for the divine figures was preordained. The doctrine also commands how limbs should be styled, underlining Hindu ideology.</p>

<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>The Chola dynasty served as a patron to <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> or <strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance</em></strong>. Proliferating in trade and development, the Chola regions observed notable advancement in bronze casting. Moreover, the expanse of the empire extended until Sri Lanka in the south and other southeast Asian countries. Hence, they had enormous access to vast copper reserves, which multiplied the production of bronze sculptures.</p>

<p><strong>Angkor Wat, in Siem Reap, Cambodia</strong> is the largest religious monument in the world. It was <strong>built for the patron King Suryavarman</strong> II (1113–1145/50 C.E.) and dedicated to the Hindu god <strong>Vishnu</strong>, one of the three principal gods in the Hindu pantheon, along with <strong>Shiva and Brahma</strong>. Vishnu is known as the protector.</p>
<p>It is believed that <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> was also to house the king after death and used as a mausoleum.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> comes from the Khmer language, the official language of Cambodia. It means City Temple.</p>
<p><strong>Siem Reap</strong> was once the capital of the Khmer empire, then known as Angkor. From the 800s to the 1300s it was a prosperous hydraulic facility that collected monsoon waters from the rainy season, in huge basins. This elevated flooding, and protected plantations during drought.</p>
<p><strong>Merchants and traders of gold and spices brought Hinduism and later Buddhism</strong>. Business opportunities caused people to stay in the region</p>
<p>Since Angkor itself was the technical source of the life-giving agricultural water controlled by the king, it was regarded by the Khmer with religious reverence. Its temples and palaces were an expression of that and at the same time an essential part of its supernatural mechanism.</p>
<p>Royal intercession by numerous ceremonies, some of which re-enacted the primal marriage of Hindu divinity and native earth spirit on the pattern of ancient folk cult, ensured the continuing gift of the waters of heaven.</p>
<p>The king, an earthly image of his god, was the intermediary who ensured that his kingdom would continue to receive divine benevolence in the form of water in controlled quantities.</p>
<p>Courtiers played roles both religious and administrative for the king, who believed that after his death he would be united with his patron deity. Dedicatory statues were often set up in his chief temple to commemorate his divinization.</p>
<p>The Khmer kings were tied to the city, even as they changed religions. The city was transformed using both Hindi and Mahayana Buddhist architecture and artistic style layers beneath the surface of the temple.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>A large moat and a high wall surround Angkor Wat on all sides, which are longer than one kilometer.</p>
<p>Inside the temple develops on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new enclosure, formed of galleries, pierced with monumental porches on all four sides and provided with corner towers</li>
<li>a <strong>second floor</strong> repeating the same arrangement</li>
<li>a <strong>central tower</strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries staggered and interconnected by cruciform galleries</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>temple mountain</strong> was a Southeast Asian invention in architecture. It represented a union between the gods and the reigning king. The capital, a square measuring 4 kilometers on each side was lined with a double rise of land. Here two axial avenues crossed ending in a natural hill in the center.</p>
<p>The five stone towers symbolized the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru, the mythical home of Hindu and Buddhist gods. It was also considered an <strong>axis-mundi</strong> or a world axis that connects heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In his city, the king could intercede and re-enact the marriage of the Hindu divinity and the earth spirit to ensure the continuing gift of waters from the heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The temples continued to multiple, with each sovereign trying to outdo the next.  The small temple of <strong>Banteay Srei</strong>, built in 967, is located 20 kilometers north-east of Angkor. It is surrounded by a low-rise enclosure that is pierced by entrance pavilions and bordered by a moat. With three towers consisting of pink sandstone, this is the first temple to use relief sculptures to illustrate Indian legends. This is a prelude to classical Khumer style. Note the reliefs of <strong>devatas </strong>(gods of Hindu epics such as Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and the <strong>tympanums</strong> depicting Hindu myths, such as the rain of Indra.</p>
<h5><strong>Rich in Decoration </strong></h5>
<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> over a thousand dancing <strong>apsaras </strong>(female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) unfold on the walls of the different courts and on the pilasters. Dressed in a bell skirt from which are two large pieces of cloth at the waist, they are lavishly adorned with bracelets, armbands, necklaces and earrings, and extravagant hairstyles.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Bas-Relief Sculptures</strong></h5>
<p>The greatest achievement of the <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> sculptors has been reached in the tens of meters long bas-reliefs of the galleries of the second such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk</em></strong> or <strong><em>Heavens and Hells</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Heavens and Hells</em></strong></h5>

<h5><strong>The Myth </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Churning of the Milk</em></strong> is a Hindu myth about the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil, as well as light and darkness. Due to this struggle twelve precious things are lost in the ocean.</p>
<p>The god Vishnu thought to use the holy mountain Mt. Mandara as a churning stick, surrounded by the serpent king (naga). This was tugged between the demons and the gods. They pulled with all their might! The churning stick stirred the waters of the milky sea for 1000 years&#8212; before recovering the <strong>amrita</strong>, the elixir of eternal life. The foam from the churning produces apsaras<em>,</em> who appear on both sides of Vishnu. Once the elixir was released, the supreme god of the Vedes, Indra descended to catch it and to save the world from the demons.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rise of Jayavarman VII</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2061" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2061" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2061" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199.-D.jpg?resize=650%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="650" height="436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199.-D.jpg?w=352&amp;ssl=1 352w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199.-D.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2061" class="wp-caption-text">Jayavarman VII as Buddha<br />© HansStieglitz@t-online.de</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the death of Suryavarman II, the Champa (the people of nowadays Vietnam) occupied the Khmer kingdom for four years (1145 to 1149).</p>
<p>Jayavarman VII achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>liberated his country and restored order.</li>
<li>conquered Champa (Vietnam), Laos, Thailand and Burma achieving the maximum extent of the Khmer kingdom</li>
<li>enthroned in 1181</li>
<li>reorganized the Khmer country</li>
<li>built a road network linking the provinces to the capital and lined them with lodgings for travelers</li>
<li>built hospitals</li>
<li>changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahāyāna).</li>
<li>raised temples dedicated to the worship of his parents</li>
<li>1186, that of Ta Prohm, in Angkor itself, dedicated to his mother deified under the aspect of a female counterpart bodhisattva.</li>
<li>1191, the temple of Preah Khan of Angkor, in memory of his father in the aspect of Bodhisattva &#8220;Lord of the World&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Work in Progress</strong></h5>
<p>Simultaneously, <strong>Jayavarman VII </strong>had to restore Angkor Thom the capital itself, destroyed and pillaged by the Chams. It used to be centered on the Baphuon, which was more than a hundred years old.  Jayavarman VII recentered it on a new temple-mountain, the Bayon and surrounded it by a moat and a high wall of stone. The new city, Angkor Thom, was &#8211; like the previous ones &#8211; enclosed in a vast quadrilateral, each side of which was oriented in relation to a cardinal point. Four triumphal ways (north-south and east-west) cut it into quarters.</p>
<p>The Buddhist cosmology inspired the symbolism and dispositions of the great foundations (Angkor Thom, Preah Khan, etc.). The architecture (plans and elevations of the temples, construction processes) and sculpture (iconography, aesthetics, adjustments) of the style of the center of its new capital, Bàyon break with four centuries of stylistic evolution and mark its end.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2088" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199-Plan.png?resize=727%2C524&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="727" height="524" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199-Plan.png?w=727&amp;ssl=1 727w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199-Plan.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Construction was not random. By combining Brahmanic notions and Buddhist ideas the architectural purpose was the glorification of the king, his deification, and his identification with the empire. Jayavarman VII, converted to Buddhism, found satisfactory solutions present the capital as the center of the world of the gods, where the king lived as equal of the gods and the protector of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>moats were oceans that encircled the world, enclosing the mountain ranges that border it</li>
<li>doors, surmounted by towers adorned with the deified face repeated four times, facing each cardinal point</li>
<li>gave access to roads lined on both sides of a hundred and eight giants of stone holding a colossal naga</li>
<li>theme of churning of the ocean, myth of creation, and that of the rainbow unites heaven and earth.</li>
<li>In the center, the Bayon, symbolic temple-mountain with a circular interior and radiant reminiscent of the Buddhist stupas, provided 50 faces, with the &#8220;smile of Angkor&#8221;, which one finds the echo in the countless statuary of this time.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Angkor Wat as a Mandala</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>mandala </strong>or circle in Sanskirt, is a spiritual geometric configuration of temples in Buddhism. This allows for harmony with the universe by aligning with the planets, sunrise, and sunset. <strong>Angkor’s</strong> central axis through the temple’s main tower, aligns with the morning sun of the Spring Equinox.</p>
<h5><strong>Destruction, Change and Abandonment</strong></h5>
<p>In 1234, Jayavaram VIII, who succeeded two Buddhist Kings, destroyed Angkor and all effigies of Buddha. He was an iconoclast operating at a very large scale. In total tens of thousands of Buddha images were defaced.</p>
<p>At the end of the 13th century, the definitive adoption of Theravāda Buddhism led to a radical change in architectural traditions and ended all major construction programs. Advocating a simpler way of life, the Theravada Buddhism made <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> the Buddhist center of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Around 1431 a new Thai attack destroyed the hydraulic system on which the economy of the kingdom was based. Shortly after, the royal court abandoned <strong>Angkor.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Angkor Wat</strong> and<strong> Petra’s</strong> stories are linked to their intricate water management systems consisting of canals and artificial water basins. Their engineering feats not only provided their inhabitants with a <strong>constant water source</strong> but tied their destiny to the <strong>ancient world trade routes</strong>.</p>
<p>In both cities, the merchants-navigators and caravans of the vast-reaching trading routes brought along their ideas. Think Hinduism and later Buddhism. They also brought traditions like Hellenistic architecture and the Greco-Roman model of interconnected public spaces.  This <strong>transformed the local cultures</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Angkor Thom</strong>, capital of the Ancient Cambodian Khmer Empire was an important center along the <strong>gold and spices</strong> trade networks of East and Southeast Asia. <strong>Petra</strong> the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom controlled the <strong>Incense Routes</strong> providing Arabian <strong>myrrh, frankincense and perfume</strong> to the Mediterranean cities and Dead Sea <strong>bitum</strong> for the ships.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Petra (400 BCE-100CE)</strong> and <strong>Angkor Thom</strong> urbanism ideas could not be more different.</p>
<p>The advent <strong>Angkor Wat </strong>(800-1400 CE) was announced by the Khmer royal tradition of building temple-mountains to their ancestors. The <strong>temple mountain</strong> was a Southeast Asian architectural invention to illustrate the union between the gods and the reigning king.</p>
<p>The Khmer capital was a gigantic square symbolizing the whole universe. Two axial avenues crossed it, ending in a natural hill at the center.  In the beginning of the 12th century, King Suryavarman II (1113-1145/50 C.E.) built the temple of <strong>Angkor Wat</strong>. He became the first king of the Angkor dynasty.</p>
<p>The original name of the temple was lost. Angkor Wat means <strong>City Temple</strong>. The temple was dedicated to <strong>Vishnu</strong>, the Protector, one of the three main Hindu gods, Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma.  The galleries of its three ascending levels and the moat <strong>symbolized the oceans that surround Mt. Meru</strong>, the home of Hindu gods. The last level is a <strong>central tower</strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries arranged in staggered rows symbolizing the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru itself.</p>
<p><strong>Angkor’s</strong> central axis given by temple&#8217;s main tower also aligns to the morning sun of the Spring Equinox. This <strong>axis-mundi</strong> is a <strong>cosmic axis connecting heaven and earth</strong>.</p>
<p>The effort demanded by the construction of <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> weakened the kingdom. It was briefly occupied by the Champa people of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Jayavarman VII liberated his country and changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahayana). The Buddhist cosmology inspired new constructions such as Preah Khan and Bayon.</p>
<p><strong>Angkor Wat</strong> survived as its plan allowed for its re-interpretation as a <strong>mandala </strong>or circle in Sanskrit. This is <strong>a spiritual geometric configuration</strong> that teaches believers the <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong> and the organization of the universe.  Its architects used the Hindu architecture for a Buddhist temple by replacing the typical Buddhist stupa, with the Mt. Meru. The believers circumambulated in the galleries around the staggered Mt. Meru. Raising level by level the believers understood the concept of eternal rebirth samsara and of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the architecture of <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> remained accompanied by a mostly Hindu bas-relief decoration including over a thousand dancing apsaras (female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) the allegories of Hindu deliverance from demons such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk</em></strong> in which the Devas (gods) fight the asura (demons) to reclaim order and power.</p>
<p><strong>Petra’s</strong> urbanism is far away from any geometrical planning. Dictated by the natural fragmented rocky environment of its surrounding sandstone cliffs, it did not allow the development of the traditional Greco-Roman grid patterns and resulted in a low-density urban network. In the early 1st century, during the reign of King Aretas IV, <strong>Petra’s </strong>cosmopolitan population peaked at almost 25,000 people and the heart of the city of <strong>Petra</strong> covered the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-369" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?resize=658%2C495&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="658" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?w=408&amp;ssl=1 408w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The city borrowed the <strong>Greco-Roman concept of public space</strong> with a monumental Roman-style theater carved directly into the sandstone bedrock, the two levels administrative/religious center of the “Great Temple”, and a colonnade street with portico. Its main axis followed the topography of Wadi Musa spring torrent.</p>
<p>After Trajan’s victory in 106 CE, the Roman conquerors built a colonnaded street on <strong>Petra</strong><strong>’s</strong> main axis connecting all its key centers.  A Roman triple-arched gate marked the access to <strong>Petra</strong><strong>’s</strong> old sacred quarter featuring Qasr el Bin, an ashlar-masonry square shrine and the colonnaded Winged Lions Temple. Both temples were dedicated to Nabatean Arabian idols.</p>
<p>Like <strong>Angkor Wat,</strong> in <strong>Petra</strong> the civil Hellenistic tradition was used for a different religious purpose. The Eastern cult of the dead created the unique rock-cut mausoleums of <strong>Petra</strong>. The result was so atypical that for a long time <strong>Petra</strong> was refused the status of a proper city and it was simply considered a necropolis.</p>
<p>The mausoleums line is at the entrance to the valley and crowns the cliffs surrounding the valley. The monumental Al-Khazneh, <strong>The Treasury</strong>— with its broken pediment and deeply carved tholos topped by a stone urn, Corinthian columns and reliefs of winged Victories, bare breasted Amazons and Castor and Polux— illustrates <strong>a flamboyant Alexandrian Hellenistic style</strong>. It draws a stark contrast with the <strong>Street of Facades</strong> and its smaller Eastern aniconic mausoleums with flat Mesopotamian roofs.</p>
<p>A row of rock-cut monumental columned tombs, <strong>The Royal tombs</strong> crowns the heights of the city itself. Their facades carved in the <strong>sandstone</strong> exhibit <strong>syncretic architectural elements</strong>: multi-storied Mesopotamian facades, Egyptian monumentality and Hellenistic colonnades and pediments. The <strong>Palace Tomb</strong> is the largest, the <strong>Corinthian Tomb</strong> has floral decorative elements, and the <strong>Silk Tomb</strong> has a wavy moiré rock façade.</p>
<p>Other monuments carved into the towering cliffs, such as <strong>Ad-Deir</strong>, or the Monastery were initially considered tombs. Ad-Deir Hellenistic architecture elements strikingly resembles ones of the Al-Khazneh, <strong>The Treasury</strong> showing the continuous experimentation of <strong>Petra’s </strong>architects with different cultural elements.  However, its austere decorations featuring circle-patterns is a legacy of the Nabataean non-figurative artistic tradition. <strong>Crosses etched onto the walls</strong> show that the Byzantines re-used it later as a church.</p>
<p>At <strong>Petra</strong> the recycling of monuments and integration of new ideas in the Nabatean did not stop with Nabataean Ptolemaic and Roman rulers. In the Byzantine period, mausoleums were converted into churches, and the spolia of damaging earthquakes served to construct new Christian Byzantine monuments.</p>
<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> and <strong>Petra </strong>art waned when their multicultural societies were threatened by the raise of religious intolerance.  The religious sites of Angkor Thom and Petra faced a methodical Hindu and respectively Muslim iconoclasm. This destroyed in <strong>Angkor</strong> all the effigies of the Buddha and in <strong>Petra</strong> all the human and animal faces.</p>

<h5><strong>Buddhism and Monasteries</strong></h5>
<p><strong>What is a Monastery?</strong></p>
<p>A monastery is a community for men, as monks, or woman as nuns. The word monk is from the Greek word <strong>monos</strong> which means to be alone.  Here, they form a new society for themselves, which is devoted to religious practices, including prayer and rituals.</p>
<p>Before monasteries were built both Buddhist and Christian monks had to rely solely on the kindness of others. The wandered the country, without a place to call home, practicing self-denial, in pursuit of religious goals. People gave them not only food, but shelter in bad weather.</p>
<p><strong>The Function</strong></p>
<p>Once monasteries were built, monks had  a community to live in with like minded others.</p>
<p>In Buddhism and Christianity monks or nuns pray on behalf of the people and the monastery is the spiritual focus of the town.</p>
<p>In Christianity, the monks pray for the salvation of the souls of the living.</p>

<p>It is different in Buddhism because there is no concept of a soul.  There is instead a cycle of rebirth called <strong>samsara</strong>. This is thought to be a repetitive state. But, when someone finally reaches <strong>moksha</strong>, this is when release from samsara occurs. This ends attachment to both the material world and the ego. In this state nirvana or liberation is reached. This is the final state in which there is <strong>oneness with everything</strong>.</p>
<p>The prayers and meditations are thought to help the community, as the common person would not possess the proper skills. Although they could turn to the monastery for instruction as well.  The people of the community can improve their <strong>karma</strong>, by giving donations of food and other useful items to the monastery.</p>
<p><strong>Dharma</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong>, also known as <strong>Dharma</strong> or the law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life is suffering (suffering = rebirth) </strong></li>
<li><strong>The cause of suffering is desire. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The cause of desire must be overcome.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When desire is overcome, there is no more suffering (suffering = rebirth)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is understood that moksha is extremely difficult to achieve. Buddha’s teachings focus on Enlightenment to assist.</p>
<p><strong>The Middle Way</strong>:  Following the middle path between extreme asceticism and extreme indulgence</p>
<p>Buddha taught the <strong>Noble Eightfold Path </strong>involving ethical conduct<strong> (<em>sila</em>), </strong>concentration<strong> (<em>samadhi</em>), </strong>and wisdom<strong> (<em>prajna</em>).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Right view</strong>: understanding where one is heading before beginning <strong>(wisdom)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right intention: </strong>committing to following the path <strong>(wisdom)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right speech</strong>: what is said to not harm others <strong>(ethical conduct)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right action</strong>: what is done to not harm others <strong>(ethical conduct)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right</strong> <strong>livelihood</strong>: daily living that does not cause harm to others <strong>(ethical conduct)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right effort</strong>: focusing energy to the task at hand <strong>(concentration)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right mindfulness</strong>: awareness of not harming oneself or others <strong>(concentration)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right concentration: </strong>a dedication to practice such as meditation <strong>(concentration)</strong></li>
</ol>

<h5><strong>Types of Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>To the first of his followers, and the tradition associated with <strong>Theravada Buddhism</strong> and figures like the great Emperor Ashoka, the Buddha was a man, not a God. He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the Mahayana School, Buddha was a savior and often a god—a god concerned with man’s sorrows above all else. The <strong>Mahayana form of Buddhism</strong> is in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrayana </strong>is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, with many rituals which define it as different. It is practiced mostly in Tibet, Mongolia and in parts of China.</p>
<p><strong>Similarities:</strong> Buddha was the founder, and they all follow the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Differences:</strong> attainment of Nirvana. Only monks can obtain Nirvana in Theravada, as is traditional Buddhism. In the Mahayana form of Buddhism followers believe that everyone can.</p>
<h5><strong>Hinduism vs. Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism arose from Hinduism. Both believe in reincarnation, karma, and working toward a good life to ultimately achieve enlightenment.</p>
<p>Hinduism has a caste system, while Buddhism does not. It does not have the rituals, priest or gods and goddesses that the Hindus do.</p>
<h5><strong>An Inspiration for Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Three types of architecture were inspired by Buddhist communal and monastic spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stupa</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vihara</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chaitya</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>stupa</strong> came first. It is considered a sepulchral monument or a place for burial or receptacle for relics. Typical items would include objects or items the person wore. After monasteries started to be built, these items were removed from the <strong>stupa</strong> and they were left to simply become symbols of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The original <strong>stupa</strong> was important. It was built by the first Buddhist ruler of India, named Ashoka.</p>
<p>Between 120 BCE and 200 C.E. over 1000 <b><i>viharas</i></b> (a monastery with residence hall for the monks), and <strong>chaityas</strong> (a stupa monument hall), were established along ancient and prosperous trade routes. The monasteries required large living areas.</p>
<h5><strong>Ashoka: the first King to embrace Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Sites special to King Ashoka (304–232 B.C.E.), the first king (of northern India) to embrace Buddhism, were also integral to the building of monasteries.</p>
<p>The complex at Sanchi, where the original Great Stupa (Mahastupa) of Sanchi was created as a reliquary for the Buddha’s ashes after his death, became the largest of many stupas that were created later when a monastery was built at the site.</p>
<p>Ashoka added one of his famous pillars at this location—pillars that not only proclaimed his acceptance of Buddhism, but also served as instructional objects on Buddhist ideology.</p>

<h5><strong>Buddhist Monasteries in India</strong></h5>
<p>In India, by the 1st century, many monasteries were founded as learning centers on sites already associated with Buddha and Buddhism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lumbini</strong> where the Buddha was born,</li>
<li><strong>Bodh Gaya</strong> where he achieved enlightenment and the knowledge of the dharma (the Four Noble Truths),</li>
<li><strong>Sarnath</strong> (Deer Park) where he preached his first sermon sharing the <em>dharma</em></li>
<li>Kushingara where he died.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Buddhist Cave Temples</strong></h5>
<p>Located in hilly, isolated regions, Buddhist cave temples were used for monks practicing their religion. In India where Buddhism was founded, there are more than 1300 of these cave temples. These were mainly built between the second century BC and the seventh century AD.</p>
<p>Each cave has a specific architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaitya</strong> (worship hall)</li>
<li><strong>Vihara</strong> (monastery)</li>
<li>Decorative with sculptures and murals pertaining to Buddhist religion</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>chaitya</strong> has a church-like structure. It has a long hall, with a horseshoe sounded hall at the end. Here there are mound shrines or <strong>stupas. </strong>These are enshrined for worship.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2094" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chatiya.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="449" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Chaitya</em> at Karle near Lonavala, Maharashtra, first century B.C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The <em>stupa</em> is at the end of the nave (the main central aisle) On either side of the columns are side aisles to help people walk through the space—around to the stupa, and back out.</p>
<p>This is <strong>similar to the architecture of Early Christianity</strong> where the side aisles at the Early Christian Church in Rome, Santa Sabina, which help the flow of people who come to worship at the altar at the end of the nave).</p>
<p>Monks lived in <strong>vihara</strong> caves. The architecture of these spaces is rectangular with a flat roof. There is a long hall in the center with sleeping quarters and mortuary temples along the sides. The name <strong>vihara </strong>translates into a secluded place to walk, in reference to a dwelling with an open courtyard.</p>
<h5><strong>Rock Cut Caves</strong></h5>
<p>The rock-cut caves were established in the 3rd century B.C.E. in the western Deccan Plateau, the southern portion of India.</p>
<p>The earliest rock-cut caves include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bhaja Caves</li>
<li>Karle Caves</li>
<li>Ajanta Caves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Profitable relationship existed between the monks and wealthy traders. The Bhaja caves were located on a major trade route from the Arabian Sea eastward toward the Deccan region linking north and south India. Merchants, wealthy from the trade between the Roman Empire and southeast Asia, often sponsored architectural additions including pillars, arches, reliefs and façades to the caves. Buddhist monks, serving as missionaries, often accompanied traders throughout India, up into Nepal and Tibet, spreading the dharma as they travelled.</p>
<p>During <strong>Hinayana (lesser vehicle)</strong> the memory of historical Buddha and his teachings were recent, so there were no images of Buddha. Eventually, the rock-cut monasteries became quite complex. They consisted of several stories with inner courtyards and veranda.</p>
<p>In the later Mahayana (greater vehicle) phase, there was a need for physical reminders of the Buddha and his teachings. Images of the Buddha drawn from the jataka stories—the life stories of the Buddha—, or of the Buddha performing his Enlightenment and his first sermon (when he shared the Four Noble Truths with the laity) proliferated in both paintings and reliefs. A stupa was still placed in the central hall, but now an image of the Buddha was carved into it, underscoring that Buddha is the stupa.</p>
<h5><strong>Early Caves in Northern India: Bhaja, Ajanta</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2096" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?resize=650%2C488&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>At <strong>Bhaja</strong> there are no representations of the Buddha other than the stupa since Bhaja was an active monastery during <strong>the earliest phase of Buddhism</strong>, <em>Hinayana</em> (lesser vehicle), when no images of the Buddha were created. In <em>Hinayana</em>, the memory of the historical Buddha and his teachings were still a very real part of the practice. The Buddha himself did not encourage worship of him (something images would encourage), but desired that the practitioner focus on the <em>dharma</em> (the law, the Four Noble Truths).</p>
<p>The main <em>chaitya</em> hall (which contained a memorial stupa, empty of relics) at Bhaja contains a solid stone stupa in the nave flanked by two side aisles. It is the earliest example of this type of rock-cut cave and closely resembles the wooden structures that preceded it. The columns slope inwards, which would have been necessary in the early wooden structures in the north of India to support the outward thrust from the top of the vault. In similar stone caves, sometimes the columns are placed in stone pots, which mimic the stone pots the wooden columns were positioned in, to thwart termites. This is an example of a practical architectural practice being adopted as the standard.</p>
<p>At <strong>Ajanta</strong>, the earliest phase of construction also belongs to the Hinayana (lesser vehicle) phase of Buddhism (in which no human image of the Buddha was created). The caves are very similar to those at Bhaja. During the second phase of construction, Buddhism was in the <strong>Mahayana</strong> (greater vehicle) phase and <strong>images of the Buddha</strong>, predominantly drawn from the jataka stories—the life stories of the Buddha—were painted throughout.</p>
<p>In Mahayana, which was more distant in time from the life of the Buddha, there was a need for physical reminders of the Buddha and his teachings. Thus images of the Buddha performing his Enlightenment and his first sermon (when he shared the Four Noble Truths with the laity) proliferated. The paintings at Ajanta provide some of the earliest and finest examples of Buddhist painting from the period. The images also provide documentation of contemporary events and social custom under Gupta reign (320-550 C.E.).</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Buddhism Iconisn-Aniconism</strong></h5>
<p>The “aniconic mode” of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism</strong> developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that <strong>never show the Buddha in human form</strong>. Instead, <strong>his presence was indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations</strong> as well as by his “non-image.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>Chinese aniconic phase</strong> refrained from any pictorial representation whatsoever and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy</strong>. The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.</p>
<h5><strong>The icon (corporeal body) of the Buddha in India and China: Gandhara style</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2097" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Icon.jpg?resize=802%2C613&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="802" height="613" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Icon.jpg?w=420&amp;ssl=1 420w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Icon.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After the 1st century C.E., <strong>with the development of Mahayana Buddhism</strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form. These new, iconic images of the Buddha were particularly popular in the region of <strong>Gandhara (in present-day Pakistan)</strong> and <strong>in Māthura, south of New Delhi.</strong> They were depictions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, i.e. bodhisattvas. Many of the concept’s characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism appear to have developed in Gandhara.</p>
<p>These anthropomorphic images usher in <strong>a new phase of Buddhist art</strong> in which artists convey meaning through the <strong>depiction of special bodily marks (lakshanas) and hand gestures (mudras) of the Buddha</strong>.</p>
<p>In this anthropomorphic image of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the artist depicts Prince Siddhartha seated on a throne, surrounded by the demon Mara and his army, who attempted—unsuccessfully—to thwart Prince Siddhartha’s attainment of enlightenment. At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth.</p>
<h5><strong>The Influence of Alexander the Great</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandhara</strong> is the ancient name of a region in <strong>northwest Pakistan</strong>. It is bounded on the west by the Hindu Kush Mountain range and to the north by the foothills of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>In 330 B.C., <strong>Alexander the Great conquered this region and familiarized its artists with the classical Greek sculpture</strong>. Starting about 50 B.C., Kushan era, the sea trade driven by monsoons increased. Thus, merchants from Rome and Middle East passed through Gandhara on their way to Central Asia and China. Gandharan control of the high mountain passes vital to this international commerce made the region wealthy. The resulting cosmopolitan elites became some of the most powerful Buddhist patrons in all South Asia.</p>
<h5><strong>Art of Gandhara</strong></h5>
<p>This art combines (syncretism) <strong>local characteristics</strong> with elements derived <strong>from both Indian and western (Greek, Roman) cultures.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Gandhara Buddha</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the body is hidden with<strong> heavy cloak echoing a Roman toga; </strong>its <strong>sharp folds</strong> echoing <strong>Greek Parthenon draping styles </strong>form concentric curves centered on the right shoulder.</li>
<li>the face is elongated, the chin is quite prominent, and the corners of the relatively thin mouth are slightly sunken.</li>
<li>the eyes are narrow under a heavy lid, gazing downward in compassion to the world</li>
<li>the <strong>wavy Greek-like hair </strong>is gathered into a topknot symbolic of wisdom</li>
<li>a lightly incised circle, called an <strong>urna</strong>, appears between the eyes.  The urna was an identifying mark of the Buddha’s divine status and ability to see beyond our realm.</li>
<li>Buddha has long earlobes that recall the heavy royal earrings he once wore</li>
<li>the second-century <strong>Bodhisattva Maitreya had a musculature markedly western/Greek</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha is shown in his human shape because of his last incarnation in the human world,  but particular bodily marks are witness to his transcendence of the human realm. <strong>After enlightenment, the historical prince Siddhartha Gautama acquired various marks (lakshana) that identify him as the Buddha.</strong></p>
<p>The importance of the bodily attributes for any Buddha image in India and China can hardly be overestimated. Descriptions of these are formalized in the Buddhist canon, specifying 32 primary and 80 secondary superhuman attributes.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the local lists are homogenous. The major bodily attributes of a Buddha are witness to his completion of awakening and are, therefore, the only adequate way to represent him in human form.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s body is dignified, well proportioned, and extremely tall, with its slender and long limbs.  The top hair bump, and the hair into tiny snail stylized curls. Another mark is the urna between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s earlobes are extended in reference to the heavy jewelry he wore previously as a prince. He wears a simple monk’s robe, in keeping with his spiritual purpose, and sits in a lotus position. His skin was said to be of a golden hue, emitting light from every single pore.</p>
<p>Fingers have all the same length, or special markings on the palms and on the soles of the feet. All parts of the Buddha’s body, even features that cannot be represented, like his voice, are determined by his being enlightened.</p>
<p>Often the face and the uncovered parts of the body were gilded, representing the light emitting from the Enlightened One’s body.</p>
<p>Other important attributes mentioned in the texts pertain to <strong>the meanings of his hands position, the <em>mudras,</em></strong> which evoke ideas during Buddhist meditation or rituals:</p>
<ul>
<li>right hand over right knee (calling Earth as a witness to Enlightenment)</li>
<li>right hand held up with palm out (symbolizing giving reassurance, “no fear”)</li>
<li>hands held at chest with fingers turning invisible wheel (setting in motion the “wheel of the doctrine”—that is, preaching)</li>
<li>hands placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched palms facing upwards (“meditation mudra”)</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2102" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Seated-Buddha.jpg?resize=833%2C623&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="833" height="623" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Seated-Buddha.jpg?w=413&amp;ssl=1 413w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Seated-Buddha.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>A Parallel with the Icon of Christ</strong></h5>
<p>A remarkable parallel can be drawn with the icon of Christ. The portrayal of his physical features follows the notion of a “delineation,” which places every human being into a coded system of features that establish a distinctive identity.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Patriarchs of the Byzantine stated that “The icon of a man is not inscribed according to nature, but according to position.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<p>In other words, there was no doubt about what the historical, incarnated Christ “looked like,” because there was only one way in which He could have manifested physically in the world. Thus “an icon has to be seen as a living eyewitness of actual events.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Buddha Sculptures &#8211; Mathura style</strong></h5>
<p>The Mathurā school started in in the <strong>central northern India</strong> and it was contemporaneous with the NW school of Gandhara (1st century CE). During a period in which Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism flourished in India, Mathura was a sacred place for the followers of Jainism who sculpted their deities</p>
<p><strong>Mathura Buddhas</strong> are related to the earlier Indian yakṣa figures (male nature deity), a direct continuation of the old Indian art of Sanchi with few Gandharan elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>facial types are more Indian-like and have a round smiling face</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buddha iconography:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>full of energy with broad shoulders, swelling chest,</li>
<li>if standing the legs are firmly planted and spaced apart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mudras</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the left-hand palm facing down in “calling earth as witness” mudra</li>
<li>often the right hand forms a mudra of “fearlessness” representing protection, peace,</li>
</ul>
<p>benevolence and the dispelling of fear; the left arm akimbo or resting on the thigh</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Warmer climatic conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buddha’s torso is dressed in a transparent monk’s robe</li>
<li>a higher fluidity of the clothing</li>
<li>drapery is closely molding the body giving the illusion of nudity</li>
<li>the right shoulder bare</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>details tend to be less realistic, and more symbolic</li>
<li>radiant inner calm and stillness, the products of supreme wisdom</li>
<li>earlier the shaven head and the topknot of the head indicated by a tiered spiral</li>
<li>later Buddhas had shell-like hair curls, which became the standard representation throughout the Buddhist world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ornate halos around the Buddha’s head, while in Gandharan art the aureole is plain</li>
<li>garments with lotus flower (symbol of purity) design</li>
<li>the presence of either the lion throne or the lotus throne.</li>
<li>the sitting Buddha images</li>
<li>naturalistic pose with legs crossed</li>
<li>represented as powerful with broad shoulders and open eyes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Standing Buddhas tend to display characteristics and attitudes seen in the Greco-Buddhist </strong></p>
<p><strong>art of Gandhara:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the clothing covers both shoulders, with symmetric folds</li>
<li>the left hand holds the gown of the Buddha while the other hand (Roman toga style)</li>
<li>the folds in the clothing are more typical of the Gandharan style</li>
<li>the clothing covers both shoulders, with symmetric folds</li>

<p>The<strong> <em>Great Stupa at Sanchi</em> </strong>in<strong> Madhya Pradesh, India </strong>is a work of<strong> stone masonry </strong>with<strong> sandstone on the dome. </strong>The initial monastic center started with the original stupa (Stupa1) + monolithic pillar built by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (reigned circa 269-232 BC) in the 3rd century BC.</p>
<p><strong>Sanchi Stupa’s outstanding importance include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large hemispherical dome crowned with a triple stone umbrella (chattras-Buddha stays under a chakra as royalty does) surrounded by a square railing</li>
<li>Around the 1st century CE under the Shungas</li>
<li>The stupa was later enlarged and encased in stone</li>

<p><strong><em>Great Stupa at Sanchi</em></strong> acknowledges <strong>early fertility symbols</strong> associated with the vitality of the <strong>fruit-bearing tree.</strong> At each end of the ornate torahs (gates) three yakshi sculptures act as architectural brackets, supporting the sandstone beams that ran above their heads. The yakshi is the almost nude female figure clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with a leg along its trunk. They wear jewelry around their necks, waists, and ankles.</p>
<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa- Circumambulating path to Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/92.-Stupa-Plan.jpg?resize=722%2C1088&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="722" height="1088" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Circumambulating</strong> is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong> (also known as the dharma and the law). By turning around, they understand what means to be caught up in samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death. Escaping on the 2nd terrace allows them to understand the escape from the cycle, the <strong>Enlightenment.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stupa= a circle or wheel and the unmoving center symbolizes Enlightenment.</li>
<li>stupas are placed on a square base, and the four sides represent the four directions, north, south, east and west.</li>
<li>Each side often has a gate—torana— in the center, which allows the practitioner to enter</li>
<li>Each gate is a life event of the Buddha: East (Buddha’s birth), South (Enlightenment), West (First Sermon where he preached his teachings or dharma), and North (Nirvana).</li>
<li>The gates are turned at right angles to the axis mundi to indicate movement in the manner of the arms of a svastika, a directional symbol that, in Sanskrit, means “to be good”</li>
<li>They are guarded by guardians to remind the passage from mundane to sacred. They are either nude or dressed with a local dhoti</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa Aniconic representations of Buddha</strong></h5>
<p>Sculptural friezes at important early Buddhist stupas like Sanchi depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the <strong>Buddha represented in aniconic form</strong>, using certain fixed symbols. On the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi the <strong>Buddha’s body is represented by the Body tree, a crowning lotus rosette </strong>on a column like structure, <strong>a stupa</strong>, the <strong>Buddha’s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).</strong></p>
<p>Each symbol <strong>represents a pivotal event in Buddha’s life:</strong> a lotus (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, a fig tree or throne representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, a wheel, a flaming column with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and a stupa (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.  In some cases, he is also represented by a pair of footprints.</p>
<h5><strong>Stupa -Jataki Monkey King story &#8211; Bodhisattva</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A depiction of the Mahakapi Jataka</strong> appears on the western gateway of the Great Stupa (Stupa 1) at Sanchi.  <strong>The first scene, depicted at the bottom, shows the arrival of the king of Benaras</strong>, mounted on a horse accompanied by soldiers. The king is shown with a parasol or chatra over his head, which signifies his royal status.</p>
<p>A feature that arouses curiosity is the portrayal of <strong>musicians who accompany the king</strong>—perhaps meant to accentuate the royal status of the king, suggesting that he travels with an entourage of attendants and musical accompaniment. <strong>To the right</strong> of the king an archer appears with bow and arrow aiming at the Bodhisattva <strong>(Great Monkey)</strong>.</p>
<p>The artist(s) of the Sanchi relief shows the Bodhisattva as the bridge by which monkeys escape the king’s arrows to join the rest of the troop in the forest. <strong>On the left side of the river</strong> (which in this relief is full of active fish and rhythmic waves of water), two men, presumably following the order of the king, appear holding a sheet below the Great Monkey as he falls.</p>
<p>The episodes depicted in the Sanchi panel <strong>give no indication of order</strong> through either time or cause and effect. Such is the complexity of this portrayal that even a viewer well-versed in this story must closely examine the panel to “read” it accurately. Apparently, the artist made this for an audience with previous knowledge of the Jataka stories. There is mention of Bodhisattva instructing the king in Buddhist law before dying from the sustained wounds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Stupas predate Buddhism</strong>. Before Buddha, teachers and philosophers were buried in stupas (Hindu funerary monuments). The shape was supposed to represent a person seated in meditation.</p>
<p>In the 6th century BCE stupas built after Buddhism contained portions of the Buddha’s ashes (not known exactly when Buddha died for sure). There were 8 stupas originally because there were 8 kings who wanted to split the remains.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century BCE Great Stupa was one of the oldest and best-preserved stupas from Ashoka’s reign. Ashoka was the greatest Mauryan king in India and the first ruler to associate with Buddhism in India. He converted after killing 100,000 people. When he converted, he disinterred Buddha’s remains from the other stupas and distributed the remains to his new stupas.</p>
<p>Ashoka built many stupas across his empire so the faithful could always access them. Ashoka chose this site because it was raised on a hill</p>
<p>In the 2nd century BCE, the Sunga Dynasty in India enlarged this stupa and decorated it by adding the gates.</p>

<p><strong>Buddha </strong>in <strong>Bamiyan, Afghanistan</strong> was one of two <strong>rock cut</strong> Buddhas fashioned with <strong>plaster, polychrome, and paint.</strong>  The largest stood <strong>150 feet tall</strong>. They were destroyed in 2001.</p>
<p>The main bodies were hewn directly from the sandstone cliffs. The stone was <strong>in situ</strong> and <strong>living rock</strong>. The details were modeled in mud, mixed with straw, coated with stucco. <strong>Gold and fine jewels</strong> were added These were gifts and offerings from pilgrims.</p>
<p>The <strong>niches</strong> are shaped like mandorlas to emphasize the statues. This also acts as protection from the elements such as rain, wind, and sun.</p>
<p>The works were an <strong>appropriation of Greek and Asian artforms.</strong> The <strong>Asian influence</strong> could be seen in the body form, facial features, and size. The <strong>Greek influence</strong> was present in the drapery and folds.</p>
<p>There is no knowledge of patron, artist, or details of the commission.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>larger Buddha</strong> was painted with a red robe and depicted as <strong>Vairocana</strong> Buddha who embodies all wisdom. This type of Buddha must be depicted as grand in size as it is a very masculine form of Buddha.</p>
<p>The <strong>smaller Buddha</strong> was painted with a blue robe and known as a historical Buddha. It may represent female aspects and as such is smaller.</p>
<p>The <strong>cave galleries</strong> are painted with wall paintings and images of Buddha. Pilgrims can walk through these caves.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandharan</strong> was a diverse culture that emerged in Afghanistan. It was influenced by Alexander the Great’s Greek empire, Buddhism from the Silk Roads, and Indian kingdoms.</p>
<p><strong>Bamiyan</strong> was a <strong>caravanserai</strong>, a “highway town” of sorts for travelers on the Silk Road that connected China to the Mediterranean. The area contained numerous Buddhist sanctuaries. By the 7<sup>th</sup> century, there were 5,000 plus monks and pilgrims in Bamiyan.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhism</strong> is not location-specific, focuses on an afterlife, and is not class-specific. it can be worshipped anywhere and spread easily among traders. Mahayana Buddhism spread due to Chinese expansion westward. It developed a concept of Buddha as an incarnation of wisdom and truth. This meant Buddha was literally larger than life. As such, monumental statuary of Buddha emerged.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Timeline</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong>1221 CE, </strong>Ghengis Khan conquered this region of Afghanistan killing everyone but left the sculptures</p>
<p>Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, who was Muslim, tried to destroy the statues in the <strong>17<sup>th</sup> century.</strong></p>
<p>In March <strong>2001</strong> the Taliban, who determined these works were idols, dynamited and destroyed them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jowo Rinpoche </em></strong>is made from <strong>gilt metals</strong> with <strong>semiprecious stones, pearls</strong>, and <strong>paint</strong> as well as <strong>items from various offerings</strong>. It is believed to have been brought to Tibet in 641 CE. Today, the <strong>5-foot-tall</strong> sculpture sits in the <strong>Jokhang Temple, Lhasa, Tibet</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally,  the sculpture was in the style of <strong>Nirmanakaya </strong>which was simple and unadorned. But it was transformed into a <strong>Sambhogakaya</strong> or adorned sculpture because of all the offerings made to it.</p>
<p>The temples’ interior is a dark labyrinth of chapels and hallways.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the <strong>holiest object in Tibet. </strong>Since it represents the Buddha, it is believed to be Buddha’s proxy. It is based on what Buddha looked like when he was 12 and it was made during his lifetime. As such, it is an important pilgrimage destination for Tibetan Buddhists. They must take a pilgrimage here if they are able and three major pilgrimage routes dead end here.</p>
<p>This object is said to bestow freedom from fear and suffering, can grant wishes and quickens the path to enlightenment.</p>
<h5><strong>The Process for Pilgrims </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Before entering, pilgrims circumambulate the temple to create good spiritual energy</li>
<li>Inside the temple, pilgrims make their way to the central shrine, often crawling on their hands or sliding on their bellies.</li>
<li>They hum prayers while bringing offerings.</li>
<li>When they reach <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong>, they pray in front of it and give offerings</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jowo</strong> means <strong>Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rinpoche</strong> means <strong>precious one</strong></p>
<p><strong>Khang</strong> means <strong>house </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This is the sacred image of <strong>Buddha at age 12</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urna</strong>: spiral or circular red dot on the forehead of Buddhist images</li>
<li>Stretched earlobes (previously as a prince, Buddha wore huge earrings that stretched out his ears)</li>
<li>Believed to be based off Buddha himself</li>
<li>Face is of inner focus and patience.</li>
<li>The meditative pose in lotus position signifies enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The temple was founded in 647 CE by King Gampo, 1<sup>st</sup> ruler of unified Tibet who imposed Buddhism. The Queen was Queen Wencheng, daughter of the Tang Chinese emperor. She is credited with bringing Buddhism to Tibet when she married King Gampo in 641 CE. Part of her dowry was the <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong>.</p>
<p>On her way to Tibet from China, her wagon got stuck in the mud. This was interpreted as the Jowo Rinpoche wanting to stay on that spot, so construction began on a temple. Every day when workers returned to the site, the construction they had done the previous day had been undone. This continued for 6 years!</p>
<p>Finally, a divination revealed that an ancient demoness was sleeping in the earth under the exact spot where they were building the temple. Every night, she would push her arms and legs, while thrashing around, wrecking the construction on the temple. To stop this, <strong>the main</strong> <strong>Jokhang Temple</strong> was built on her heart to weigh her down and prove Buddhism’s supremacy, and <strong>ten smaller temples</strong> were built around Jokhang Temple to hold down her arms and legs.</p>
<h5><strong>Development of Vajrayana Buddhism (Tantric Buddhism)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A further evolution of Mahayana Buddhism</strong>, Vajrayana (Sanskrit: “Thunderbolt Vehicle” or “Diamond Vehicle”) form of Buddhism that was developed in India about 500–600 C.E. in India and neighbouring countries, especially Tibet. It was based on the traditions of late (600) Indian and Chinese Buddhism with a strong emphasis on monasticism.</p>
<p>Unique to Tibetan Buddhism is the institution of the tulku (incarnate lama): <strong>Tibetan Buddhists believe that compassionate teachers are reborn again and again, in each lifetime. </strong>Identified when they are children and invested with the office and prestige of their previous rebirths. Tibet has had many such lamas, <strong>the most famous of whom is the Dalai Lama</strong>.</p>

<p>The Fifth Dalai Lama became ruler of Tibet in 1642, and under his rule was built the great palace of the Potala in Lhasa, the country’s capital. Tibet was incorporated into China in 1951, and the present (Fourteenth) Dalai Lama went into exile in India in 1959, when the Tibetan diaspora began. Since that time, Tibetan Buddhism has become of increasing interest to people throughout the world.</p>
<p>Based on a sophisticated scholastic philosophy that can be traced to ancient Hindu and Vedic texts, the followers of Vajrayana Buddhism believe in <strong>a shortcut to enlightenment through psychological/physiological transformations</strong>. This involves elaborate forms of tantric practice believed to be handed out by Buddha to selected disciples to recapture his own enlightenment experience. It also includes borrowed exorcism practices from Bön (Tibet’s indigenous belief system).</p>
<p><strong>They practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>yoga techniques of meditation, mantra (sacred power words)</li>
<li>rituals using vajra (the weapon of the Indian Vedic rain and thunder-deity Indra) and ghanta (bell), sacred images (such as those in the museum collection), hand and body gestures (mudra) .</li>
</ul>
<p>Tibetan Buddhism eventually spread into Mongolia and Nepal, as well as into China, where it received imperial patronage especially during the Yuan (1260–1368) and Qing (1368–1644) dynasties. It also influenced parts of Southeast Asia and East Asia.</p>
<p>As an offshoot of Mahayana Buddhism, the Vajrayana pantheon is made up of a vast group of buddhas, bodhisattvas, dakinis (female buddhas), and fierce deities whose devotees venerate them as great protectors.</p>
<p>Vajrayana’s <strong>visual arts culminate in the mandalas</strong>, elaborate diagrams representing the universe and used as meditation aids. <strong>Temples and mandalas are sacred spaces</strong> that believers can inhabit through meditation and can help interacting with buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Vajrayana Buddhists engage in <strong>a variety of rituals and ceremonies, some of which are considered taboo by other Buddhism branches</strong>: (visual) meditation practices, ritual devotion to buddhas and bodhisattvas, pilgrimage, and mantra recitation.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #000000; font-size: 1.375rem;">(3) 58. Church of Sainte-Foy (Reliquary of Sainte Foy)</strong></p>
<p>Romanesque Europe. Stone. 1050-1130 CE. Conques, France. Romanesque.</p>
<p><strong>A relic is an object that is esteemed or venerated because of association with a sanctified historical person</strong>. Catholic churches have a long history of collecting and venerating relics. The more closely something was associated with Christ, the more spiritually valuable it was.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Sainte-Foy?</strong></h5>
<p>Sainte Foy (English: Saint Faith) was born in the French/Roman 2<sup>nd</sup> century city of Agen. She became a martyr when she was killed by the Romans by refusing to worship pagan gods. She was only 12 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Her skull became the relic</strong> that pilgrims wanted to visit. It was believed that it cured blindness.</p>
<p>There are formal characteristics shared by both <strong><em>Jowo Rinpoche and</em> <em>Reliquary of Sainte Foy</em> </strong> that relate to their association with relics . Each is shaped as a human whose pose, expression, and embellishment, indicate the core beliefs associated with the relics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Figural sculptures</li>
<li>Static, rigid postures and bilateral symmetry</li>
<li>Expressionless faces</li>
<li>Reflective luster of the surfaces</li>
<li>Seated position</li>
</ul>
<p>The rigid, static pose of these figures and their bilateral symmetry reflect a separation from earthly concerns and suggest a spiritual transcendence. This is also communicated through their <strong>calm, expressionless faces</strong>. Likewise, the <strong>reflective luster of the surfaces evokes an association with the spiritual realm</strong>. Finally, the seated positions of the figures convey different ideas.</p>
<p>The enthroned Sainte-Foy reflects the heavenly majesty of a sainted Christian marty, while the Jowo Rinopoche lotus position and “calling the earth as witness” mudra reflect his enlightenment.</p>
<p>The materials/imagery used reinforce the reliquary Sainte-Foy’s association with relics.</p>
<h5><strong>Materials</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>gold and silver</strong> convey the heavenly rewards (of Christian martyrdom)</p>
<p>The Reliquary of Sainte-Foy is a female figure enthroned and richly embellished. The figure is <strong>sculpted in wood and plated in gold and silver gilt repoussé</strong>. Cabochon <strong>gems and enameling</strong> add to the lavish presentation.</p>
<p>Many of the gemstones encrusting the surface were donated by pilgrims as part of their veneration.</p>
<p>There are <strong>elements of ancient Roman art</strong>. The head of the saint is a reused ancient Roman sculpture and antique cameos are found on the exterior. This links the reliquary to the Christian persecution era, corresponding with the age of the relics contained inside. This use of spolia (repurposed art) makes the object even greater in value by associating it with the treasures of the Roman Empire and by linking the sculpture to the era in which Sainte-Foy was martyred.</p>
<h5><strong> Imagery</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The youthful appearance of the figure which recalls the story of the 12-year-old martyr who refused to renounce her Christian faith.</li>
<li>The blank stare of the figure reflects a spiritual transcendence from earthly life.</li>
<li>The jeweled crown or throne that evokes the heavenly majesty of a sainted Christian martyr.</li>
<li>The lamb imagery and crucifixion scene at the base of the throne parallels the martyr’s sacrifice with that of Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Their function is associated with movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>with a destination to which pilgrims travel</li>
<li>a relic/reliquary is a fixed object in a specific location: a pilgrimage on a known route.</li>
<li>Their function is religious and cannot be explained outside a Christian/Buddhist context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>reliquary of Sainte-Foy</strong> is synonymous with its Christian context. Its function cannot be seen, considered, or described without reference to the Church of Sainte-Foy. The object does have a more varied history. The saint’s remains were transferred from Agen to Conques in the 9th century, and the head of the statue is widely believed to be a repurposed imperial portrait from the later Roman Empire. Yet the fundamental religious function of the reliquary of Sainte-Foy has remained the same for centuries.</p>
<p>The <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong> despite the historical evidence is <strong>seen as a relic of the historical Buddha</strong>, carved by a celestial architect to serve as Buddha’s proxy after he leaves Earth.</p>
<p>Both works function is to express the power of their relics. The access to them is institutional, held by a religious order and held on display to be viewed by the public.</p>
<p>Once a year, on the saint’s feast day, the reliquary is paraded in a glass case through the town of Conques so that it may be viewed and venerated by large crowds. The reliquary also protects the relics. The actual relics of Sainte-Foy are not seen. They are believed to be engaged through prayer and contemplation during the pilgrimage.</p>
<p><strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong> was built to act as a proxy of Buddha after he left Earth.</p>
<h5><strong>Difference in function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The relics of Sainte-Foy are never seen</li>
<li>Buddha relic, Jowo Rinpoche is permanently on display</li>
</ul>

<p>Miguel González. New Spain. 1698 CE.  Based on original Virgin of Guadalupe, Basilica of Guadalupe, Mexico City.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-553" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/95-Virgin-of-Guadalupe.jpg?resize=369%2C489&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="369" height="489" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this work of oil on canvas, on wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl the standing Virgin hovers above an eagle on <strong>a cactus (Mexico’s city symbol),</strong> a winged cherub, and a crescent moon . Mary&#8217;s face has an ashen tone.</p>
<p>Gonzalez’s depiction of the Virgin Mary is tied to European traditions.  Her entire body is surrounded by a glowing aureole of light augmented with golden rays, her feet rest on a crescent moon, and she wears a golden crown. All are references to the Woman of the Apocalypse, in the Book of Revelation.</p>
<p>The Virgin’s robes have been crafted from mother-of-pearl using a new, luxurious technique known as enconchado, inspired by imported Far East artworks. The reflective luster of the mother-of-pearl in the light emphasizes a divine status .</p>
<p>In Miguel González’s <strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe (Virgen de Guadalupe)</em></strong> the Virgin Mary is depicted in the form of the image said to have imprinted itself miraculously on the cloak of an indigenous man, Juan Diego, to whom she appeared in Mexico in the 16th century. The standing figure of the Virgin, her eyes downcast and hands clasped in prayer, hovers above an eagle, its wings spread wide, perched on a cactus, all supported by a winged cherub. Four roundels depict the manifestation of the Virgin in an indigenous form in the new world</p>
<h5><strong>Function as a Devotional Object</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the local features of the icon were intended to make the figure of Mary more accessible</li>
<li>to assist the converted local population in their devotions towards the Virgin</li>
<li>to promote the conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity</li>
<li>as a large artwork permanently affixed to a wall, it required the pilgrimage of devotees</li>
<li>as a copy of the famed, miracle-working image it has been credited with sharing some of the power of the original image displayed in the Basilica of Guadeloupe in Mexico City, yet there is no recorded a manifestation of divine action.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong>, in <strong>Central Java, Indonesia</strong>, is made from <strong>volcanic-stone masonry</strong>. It is <strong>the largest Buddhist temple in the world</strong> and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is 300 years older than Angkor Wat and 400 years older than the European Cathedrals. The Indonesian temple was buried under volcanic ash and overgrown with vegetation until discovered by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Raffles in 1814. A team of Dutch archaeologists restored the site in 1907–11. A second restoration was completed by 1983.</p>

<p>Visiting the temple requires circumambulating through the corridors. It is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the Four Noble Truths (also known as the dharma and the law). This helps to understand samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>Climbing up successive terraces allows for understanding the transition from the lowest manifestations of reality, through a series of spiritual regions, toward the enlightenment at the summit which allows unrestricted views of the mountains, offering a liberating feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p>One <strong>enters on the east gate</strong>, and <strong>reads from left to right</strong>, moving in a <strong>clockwise direction</strong> around the monument. Almost 5 km of <strong>carved bas reliefs</strong> educate the illiterate according to Mahayana Buddhism texts. These texts deal with the self-discovery and education of the bodhisattva, conceived as being with compassionate, and fully devoted to the salvation of all creatures.</p>
<p>The stories from Buddha’s life, Jataka and Avadana illustrate lessons on morality, karma and merit that distinguished the enlightened creature.</p>
<p>Buddhist religion, philosophy and cosmology is woven into the architecture of the Borobudur. The temple is the symbol of Mount Meru, which is considered the center of the universe in Indian cosmology.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the teachings of Buddha the temple represents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the Four Noble Truths</li>
<li>the Noble Eightfold Path</li>
<li>the three realms of existence: Kāmadhātu, Rūpadhātu and Arūpadhātu</li>
</ul>
<p>These help to guide the visitors  to follow the spiritual teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Kāmadhātu</strong> <strong>(Desire Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>160 reliefs based on the text of Mahakarmavibhangga, which is about the law of cause and effect (karma).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rūpadhātu (Form Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scenes depicting mankind’s consciousness about the meaning of life through reliefs on a four sides gallery, both inside and out.</li>
<li>To view in the correct order, one must walk around clockwise four times and observe both upper and lower reliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arūpadhātu (Formless Realm) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reliefs depicted at the top illustrating Enlightenment (Nirvāṇa) which requires an almost five kilometer walk clockwise, ten times, to view correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Other Forms of Decoration</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>birds</li>
<li>flowers</li>
<li>mythical beings like Kāla above the temple entrance</li>
<li>Makara mythical being with an elephant trunk and an open mouth from which the head of a lion emerges are at the base of the gate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is shaped as a stepped grey andesite pyramid with 3 levels—a square base, a middle level of five square terraces, and an upper level of three circular terraces—totaling 9 lesser sections. The number 9 which represents the end of a cycle in the decimal system, which originated from the Indian subcontinent as early as 3000 BC is mystic in Buddhism and Hinduism. Important Buddhist rituals usually involve 9 monks.</p>
<p><strong>The historical Buddha had 9 virtues</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accomplished</li>
<li>Perfectly Enlightened</li>
<li>Endowed with knowledge and Conduct</li>
<li>Well-spoken</li>
<li>the Knower of worlds</li>
<li>the Guide Unsurpassed of men to be tamed</li>
<li>the Teacher of gods and men</li>
<li>Enlightened</li>
<li>Blessed</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>3 circular terraces carry small stupas</strong>, crowned at the centre of the summit by a large, circular, bell-shaped stupa, 115 feet (35 metres) above the base. The bottom plinth encasement that obscures an entire series of reliefs consists of a massive heap of stone pressed up against the original structure. It was probably added to hold together the bottom story, which began to spread under the pressure of the immense weight of earth and stone accumulated above.</p>
<p>The lowest level, which is partially hidden, contains reliefs of earthly desires, illustrating “the realm of feelings/desires”, <strong>the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe</strong>. It portrays the law of cause and effect. For example, if you like gossiping, you might be reborn with an ugly appearance.</p>
<p>The next level is a 13-foot-wide corridor open to the sky and adorned with bas-reliefs that depict “the realm of forms” through events in the life of the historical Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas. There are 2 registers: the balustrade depicting fables about altruism.</p>
<p>Opposite the balustrade is the main wall where the Jatakas stories are located.</p>
<p><strong>Lalitavistara</strong>, a set of 120 reliefs on the first platform, depict Prince Siddharta’s life from birth to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Queen Maya riding  in a horse carriage is retreating to Lumbini garden to give birth to Prince Siddhartha. In the nativity scene, Queen Maya&#8217;s depiction recalls the tree spirits or yakshinis. These spirits are are often shown as beautiful and voluptuous, with a flywhisk in right hand, fleshy cheeks, wide hips, narrow waists, broad shoulders, knotted hair and exaggerated, spherical breasts. According to legend, the infant stood and took seven steps. With each step, a lotus flower appeared, to prevent his tiny feet from touching the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Here is the Story</strong></p>
<p>“Prince Siddharta was born to King Sudhodana and Queen Maya of the Sakya clan who reigned in Kosala, India, around the fifth century BC. One day Queen Maya had a dream of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was interpreted by priests as a sign that the couple would bear a son, who would become either a world ruler or a Buddha. The king preferred him to be the world ruler, so he confined the prince in the palace and indulged him in sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>As fate had it, one day the prince went out of his palace and he saw a sick person, an old person, a corpse, and a monk. Siddharta realized that he, too, would become old, sick, and die. Later, he renounced his mundane life and embarked on his search for true happiness. After learning from several spiritual teachers, and practicing severe ascetism for six years, he finally meditated under a bodhi tree. Here he attained enlightenment. Because of his compassion for fellow humans, he revealed the path to achieve unconditional happiness.”</p></blockquote>
<h5>The Jataka Tales</h5>
<p>The <strong>Jataka tales</strong> are about the 500 Bodhisattvas, the alternating human and animal forms in which Buddha was reincarnated before he was born as Prince Siddhartha and attained enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>Animals perform self-sacrifices for other beings</strong>. “A sad monkey hugging a buffalo’s neck is the story of real friendship. One day a monkey had a problem. An ogre wanted to eat him. Devastated, the monkey told his buffalo friend about his fate. The buffalo comforted the monkey, saying that he would offer himself instead. What’s more, the buffalo’s body was bigger. The buffalo just asked themonkey to send his best wishes to his relatives. Then they both met the ogre. Touched by thekindness of the buffalo, the ogre dismissed his plan to eat either of them.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avadana (Noble Deeds)</strong> are similar to Jataka, but the main figures are legendary people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sudhana’s quest for enlightenment</strong></p>
<p>He was an Indian youth, maybe a merchant’s son seeking bodhi (enlightenment). He takes a pilgrimage on his quest for enlightenment and studies under 52 “teachers”: a doctor teaches him compassion for the ill, children playing teach him about simple happiness,…</p>
<p>The upper level illustrates “the realm of formlessness,” or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration, but lining the terraces are <strong>72 bell-shaped stupas, many containing a statue of the Buddha, partly visible through the lattice stonework</strong>. The <strong>504 Buddha statues are shaped to express 6 different mudras</strong> (hand positions).</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Buddha Hand Gestures and Significance</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>Right hand across right knee symbolizing the summons of the Earth Goddess.</li>
<li>Right hand open with the face of the hand facing upwards – a symbolic gesture of loving kindness by the act of giving.</li>
<li>Both hands folded on his lap symbolic for meditation.</li>
<li>Right hand raised upwards with the face of the hand facing the audience – a symbolic gesture of dispelling of fear.</li>
<li>Right hand slightly lifted upwards with the tips of his thumb and index finger touching each other – a symbolic gesture of preaching the Dharma.</li>
<li>Both hands raised in front of the center of the upper body, touching with his right ring finger his left index finger – by far the most important symbolic gesture, for it represents the turning of the wheel of the Dharma.</li>
</ol>
<p>The archways allow people to access the higher levels are decorated with pre-Buddhist elements,  such as the fearsome face and open mouth of Kala. This is a Hindu deity from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, In Javanese mythology, Batara. Kala is the god of destruction.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbolism of the Mandala</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2126" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=544%2C628&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="544" height="628" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=260%2C300&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 888w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=768%2C885&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?w=1041&amp;ssl=1 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The temple’s plan suggests a <strong>mandala</strong>, one of the richest visual objects in Buddhism. A mandala is a symbolic picture of the universe painted on a wall or scroll, or simply created with colored sands on a table. It represents an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation. Each object in the palace has significance, representing an aspect of wisdom or reminding the meditator of a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The <strong>mandala&#8217;s purpose is to help transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones</strong> and to <strong>assist with healing. </strong> The entire sacred manmade mountain of chiseled gray andesite is a giant stupa. On the topmost terrace, the main stupa contained an unfinished image of Buddha with the hands not fully carved that was hidden from the spectator’s view, symbolized the indefinable ultimate spiritual state.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>Progressively the reliefs on the terraces become more static. The sensuous roundness of the forms of the figures is not abated but, in the design, great emphasis is laid upon horizontals and verticals and upon static, formal enclosures of repeated figures and gestures. At the summit all movement disappears.</p>
<p>The circular design enclosing the stupa, between the reliefs are decorative scroll panels, and a hundred monster-head waterspouts carrying off the tropical rainwater.</p>
<p>The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar.</p>
<h5><strong>The Javanese Variation</strong></h5>
<p>Although the origin of the temple is based on Indian mythology and Buddhist iconography, one can see the Javanese influence. The statues are less refined and have been recreated in the local perception of beauty. This is the way Buddhism was manifested in Java during the Sailendra dynasty.</p>
<p>Based on Indian influences and Mahāyāna Buddhism, arriving via China during Tang dynasty (618-906), this became the Buddhism of Java.</p>
<p>Sailendra dynasty shared their power with the Hindu dynasty Sanjaya. For example, the construction of the Kalasan temple – illustrates, that, apart from its religious function, the <strong>Borobudur</strong> also formed an important expression of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2107 " src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=717%2C473&#038;ssl=1" alt="Buddha © Dallas and John Heaton/Free Agents 1 Limited/Corbis" width="717" height="473" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The congregational worship in<strong> Borobudur</strong> is performed in a walking pilgrimage paying reverence to the stupa. This is achieved by circumambulating and keeping it on the right. The visitor is transformed and educated, while climbing through the levels of Borobudur. The encountering of illustrations of progressively more profound tales from Jataka and Avadana is achieved in a  similar way to the very early frescoes of the Ajanta Caves in India.</p>
<p>Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.</p>
<p><strong>Vesak, the “Buddha Day” ceremony, occurs once a year during a full moon</strong>. Thousands of Buddhist monks walk in solemn procession to Borobudur to commemorate the Buddha’s birth, death, and enlightenment. Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their teacher.</p>

<h5><strong>Annex: The tradition of the 1st image: King Udyana’s/Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty</strong></h5>
<p><strong>In Christian tradition</strong>, the legend of St. Luke the evangelist, who portrayed the virgin mother and the son, was developed roughly from the sixth to the eighth centuries, and propagated the idea that Christ’s image, but also that of his mother, the virgin, can be regarded as an historical portrait.</p>
<p><strong>The Buddhist tradition</strong> knows of a comparable legend about Buddha’s first image which was three dimensional and carved of sandalwood.</p>
<p><strong>King Udyana</strong> was distressed at not being able to behold the Enlightened One’s appearance, therefore Udyana decided to have a sandalwood image made, five feet in height. When the Buddha descended from the heaven of the thirty-three gods, he accepted it and pointed out the various merits achieved by image making.</p>
<p>This scene is illustrated in a stone relief from Gandhara, where we see the Buddha holding the image up in his hand and Udyana kneeling in front of him. In the late fifth century, the Udyana legend was linked with the story of the dream of Emperor Ming (58-76 CE) of the Han dynasty in the official tale of how Buddhism was introduced to China.</p>
<p>The new story claimed that the Buddha’s painting that the emperor received was in fact the same first image produced by King Udyana in the Buddha’s lifetime, thus giving authority to Chinese icons of the Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>The Udyana legend</strong> became embellished over time with details relating how one or many artisans were miraculously transported to the heavens to create the likeness of the living Buddha. Even today, there is an icon named the Udyana Shaka in Kyoto that is believed to be a direct copy of the legendary Udyana image that was brought from China to Japan by the monk Chonen in 985.</p>
<p>Seiryoji’s Shaka icon was always believed to embody miraculous powers that could be transferred to a replica if the copy was done with appropriate accuracy. The Udyāna story does not only establish the tradition of a first image in the likeness of the Enlightened One, but also makes a claim for the anthropomorphic Buddha image to be a divine image that is religiously efficacious, even to the point that it is equal to the extraordinary salvific powers of the Buddha’s relics.</p>
<p>The salvific efficacy of a divine image is affirmed by its ability to work miracles, which, once it happens, turns out to be not at all surprising, but rather expected and matter of fact. Furthermore, the type of miracles produced by images is foreseeable and consists primarily of various appearances of light and the self-induced movement of the image.</p>
<p>Stories about miraculous images were recorded in various text sources compiled during the sixth and seventh centuries. Within these miracle stories, a group of marvelous icons termed Aśoka images can be identified.</p>
<p>Historically, King Ashoka (reigned ca. 273-232 BCE) of the Maurya Dynasty left his famous stone edicts to testify to his widespread propagation of Buddhism, <strong>but at his time still no anthropomorphic Buddha images were known</strong>.</p>
<p>In China, his legend of having constructed 84, 000 relic stupas all over the world extended to sacred images. Even though stories of Ashoka images had become popular in the south of China, the notion of images possessing miraculous powers probably first arrived in the northern parts of China in the fifth century.</p>
<p>These Ashoka images are characterized not only by their wonder-working abilities, but also by their miraculous origin that is usually narrated in stories about wondrous discoveries.</p>
<p>One typical story about such images is a mural on the west side of the south wall in cave 323 at Dunhuang. Texts in accompanying cartouches state that two large Buddha statues on lotus pedestals came floating on the river Wu. Only the monks and believers in the Buddhist Law the wind and waves calmed down, and the statues could be taken to the monastery where they are worshipped until this very day</p>
<h5><strong>Annex: The Great Monkey King (Jat 407)</strong></h5>
<p>One day in Jetavana Monastery, Bhikkhus began talking about the good that the Buddha did for his relatives. When the Buddha asked them about their subject, and they told him, he said, &#8220;Bhikkhus, this is not the first time the Tathagata has done good works to benefit relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he told this story of the past.</p>
<p>Long, long ago, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the Bodhisatta was born as a monkey in the Himalayas. When he was fully grown, he was extremely strong and vigorous and became the leader of a troop of eighty thousand monkeys.</p>
<p>On the bank of the Ganges there was an enormous mango tree, with two massive branches so thick with leaves it looked like a mountain. Its sweet fruit was of exquisite fragrance and flavor. One branch spread over the bank of the river, but the other extended over the water.</p>
<p>One day, while the monkey king was eating the succulent fruit, he thought, &#8220;If any of this fruit ever fell into the river, great danger could come to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent this, he ordered the monkeys to pick all the mango flowers or tiny fruit from that branch. One fruit, however, was hidden by an ant&#8217;s nest and escaped the monkeys&#8217; attention. When it ripened, it fell into the river.</p>
<p>At that time, the King of Baranasi was bathing and amusing himself in the river. Whenever the king bathed in the river, he had nets stretched both upstream and downstream from where he was. The mango floated down the river and stuck in the net upstream from the king.</p>
<p>That evening, as the king was leaving, the fishermen pulled in the net and found the fruit. As they had never seen a fruit like this before, they showed it to the king.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this fruit?&#8221; the king asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not know, sire,&#8221; they answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The foresters, sire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The king summoned the foresters, who told him that the fruit was a mango. The king cut it with a knife and, after having the foresters eat some, tasted it himself. He also gave some of the fruit to the ministers and to his wives.</p>
<p>The king could not forget the magnificent flavor of the ripe mango. Obsessed with desire for the new fruit, he called the foresters again and asked where the tree stood. When he learned that it was on the bank of the river, he had many rafts joined together and sailed upstream to find it. In due course, the king and his retinue arrived at the site of the huge tree.</p>
<p>The king went ashore and set up a camp. After having eaten some of the delectable mangoes, he retired for the night on a bed prepared at the foot of the tree. Fires were lit and guards set on each side.</p>
<p>At midnight, after the men had fallen asleep and all was quiet, the monkey king came with his troop.</p>
<p>The eighty thousand monkeys moved from branch to branch eating mangoes. The noise woke the king, who roused his archers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surround those monkeys eating mangoes and shoot them,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Tomorrow we will dine on mango fruit and monkey&#8217;s flesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The archers readied their bows to obey the king. The monkeys saw the archers and realized that all means of escape had been cut off. Shivering in fear of death, they ran to their leader and cried, &#8220;Sire, there are men with bows all around the tree preparing to shoot us. What can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not fear,&#8221; he comforted them. &#8220;I will save your lives.&#8221; Then he climbed onto the branch stretching over the river. Springing from the end of it, he jumped a hundred bow-lengths and landed on the opposite bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Judging the distance, he had jumped, he thought, &#8220;That is how far I came.&#8221; Then he found a long vine and cut it, thinking, &#8220;This much will be fastened to a tree, and this much will go across the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>He secured one end of the vine to a sturdy tree and the other around his own waist. Then he again leapt across the river with the speed of a cloud blown by the wind. In his calculation, however, he had forgotten to include the length to be tied around his own waist, so he could not reach the trunk of the mango tree.</p>
<p>He reached out and grabbed the end of a branch firmly with both hands. He signaled to the troop of monkeys and cried, &#8220;Quick! Step on my back and run along this vine to safety. Good luck to you all!&#8221;</p>
<p>The eighty thousand monkeys, each in turn, respectfully saluted the monkey king, asked his pardon, and escaped in this way. The last monkey in the troop, however, had long resented the leader and wished to overthrow him. When he saw the monkey king hanging there, he exulted, &#8220;This is my chance to see the last of my enemy!&#8221; Climbing onto a high branch, he flung himself down on the monkey king&#8217;s back with a dreadful blow that broke his heart.</p>
<p>After he caused his rival excruciating pain, the wicked monkey triumphantly escaped and left the monkey king to suffer alone.</p>
<p>Having seen all that had happened as he lay on his bed, the king thought, &#8220;This noble monkey king, not caring for his own life, has ensured the safety of his troop. It would be wrong to destroy such an animal. I will have him brought down and taken care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ordered his men to lower the monkey gently down to a raft on the Ganges. After the monkey had been brought ashore and washed, the king anointed him with the purest oil. Spreading an oiled skin on his own bed and laying the monkey king on it, the king covered him with a yellow robe.</p>
<p>After the noble animal had been given sugared water to drink, the king himself took a low seat and addressed him. &#8220;Noble monkey, you made yourself a bridge for all the other monkeys to pass over to safety. What are you to them, and what are they to you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The monkey explained, &#8220;Great king, I guard the herd. I am their lord and chief. When they were filled with fear of your archers, I leapt a great distance to save them. After I had tied a vine around my waist, I returned to this mango tree. My strength was almost gone, but I managed to hold the branch so that my monkeys could pass over my back and reach safety. Because I could save them, I have no fear of death. Like a righteous king, I could guarantee the happiness of those over whom I used to reign. Sire, understand this truth! If you wish to be a righteous ruler, the happiness of your kingdom, your cities, and your people must be dear to you. It must be dearer than life itself.”</p>
<p>After teaching the king in this way, the monkey king died. The king gave orders that the monkey king should be given a royal funeral. He ordered his wives to carry torches to the cemetery with their hair disheveled. The ministers sent a hundred wagon loads of wood for the funeral pyre. When the regal ceremony was over, the ministers took the skull to the king.</p>
<p>The king built a shrine at the monkey&#8217;s burial place and made offerings of incense and flowers. He had the skull inlaid with gold, raised on a spear, and carried in front of the procession returning to Baranasi. There he put it at the royal gate and paid homage to it with incense and flowers. The whole city was decorated, and the skull was honored for seven days.</p>
<p>For the rest of his life the king revered the skull as a relic, offering incense and garlands. Established in the wonderful teaching of the monkey king, he gave alms and performed other good deeds. He ruled his kingdom righteously and became destined for heaven.</p>
<p>After the lesson, the Buddha declared the Truths and identified the Birth: &#8220;At that time the king was Ananda, the monkey retinue was this assembly, the wicked monkey was Devadatta, and I myself was the monkey king.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>South, East and Southeast Asia</h2>
<h3>300 BCE- 1980 CE</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1475" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=990%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.4 Theories and Interpretations of South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia developed many artistic and architectural traditions that are deeply rooted in Asian aesthetics and cultural practices. Asian arts and architecture reveal exchanges of knowledge in visual style, form, and technology with traditions farther west.</p>
<h5><strong>GrecoRoman Connections</strong></h5>
<p>Early connections with the <strong>GrecoRoman</strong> world are evident in the Hellenistic-influenced artistic style and subjects found in artwork associated with ancient Gandharan culture in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Early Buddha sculptures in north India, China, and Japan wear a two-shouldered robe based on the Roman toga.</p>
<h5><strong>Islamic Influence</strong></h5>
<p>South and Southeast Asia had early <strong>contact with Islam</strong> through trade. In western India, contact was achieved through military campaigns. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Islamic sultanates arose in these lands, creating another layer of cultural practices and interactions. This influenced Asian visual culture through the importation and creation of new art forms and styles.</p>
<p>Innovations based on Islamic influence in these areas include the use of paper for manuscripts and paintings. It also includes the adoption of Mughal styles in Hindu court architecture, painting, and fashion.</p>
<h5><strong>European Adaptations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>European influence</strong> is evident in the evolution of architectural styles, and in the adoption of naturalism and perspective in Asian painting traditions during the colonial era.</p>
<h5><strong>Sharing with West Asia and Europe</strong></h5>
<p>Asian art forms had great influence on the arts of West Asia and Europe. Art and ideas were exchanged through trade routes. The impact of Asian art is especially evident during times of free exchange. Import time frames include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Silk Route during the Han and Tang dynasties and Mongol Empire.</li>
<li>The colonial era.</li>
<li>The opening of Japan for trade in the 19th century.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>A Market for Collectors</strong></h5>
<p>In West Asia and Europe, collectors acquired Asian art works through gift or trade. Ceramics created in China, from Tang slipwares to highfire porcelains, have been coveted internationally for more than 1,000 years. The popularity of <strong>Chinese blue-and-white porcelain</strong> was so high that ceramic centers in Iran, Turkey, and across Europe developed local versions of blue-and-white ceramics to meet market demand.</p>
<p><strong>Textiles</strong> are also an important Asian art form. So coveted these fabrics dominated much of the international trade between Europe and Asia. <strong>Silk and silk weaving</strong> originated in <strong>China</strong>, where it flourished for thousands of years. <strong>Cotton</strong> was first spun and woven in the Indus Valley region of <strong>Pakistan</strong> and was, like silk, important for international trade.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Comparisons in Cultures</strong></h5>
<p>Cross-cultural comparisons may be made most readily among the arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia and the arts of the ancient Mediterranean, medieval Europe, and West Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Ryoan-ji (wet and dry gardens) </strong>is a<strong> rock garden in Kyoto, Japan </strong>that measures<strong> 100 feet by 33 feet. </strong></p>
<p>It has a rectangular plot of pebbles, surrounded by low earthen walls, with 15 rocks laid out in small groups on patches of moss. Rocks are encircled by white pebbles which are smooth river rock.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight on the Rocks</strong></p>
<p>The rocks are in five groups with 15 rocks in total.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 group of 5</li>
<li>2 groups of 3</li>
<li>2 groups of 2</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrangement of rocks leads the viewers’ eyes from left to right. Balance is achieved by small groups which create a rhythm and overall sense of harmony.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a <strong>Zen temple</strong>. It serves as a place of spiritual refreshment, contemplation, and rejuvenation. Since the elite practiced <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong>, this was a sign of status. It was used to incite meditation.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2069" style="width: 881px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2069" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=881%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="881" height="565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?w=330&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2069" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, dry garden © Vanni Archive/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The dry garden was viewed from a temple deck as an exercise in enlightenment and acceptance. No matter what vantage point you have, you can only ever see 14 out of the 15 rocks. It is said that you can only see the 15<sup>th</sup> rock through <strong>attaining enlightenment.</strong></p>
<p>The number <strong>15 denotes completeness in Buddhism.</strong></p>
<p>Buddhists maintain completeness is not possible.</p>
<p>If you TRULY accept that you can’t see the stone (that you cannot have completeness), then you become enlightened, and THEN you can see the 15<sup>th</sup> stone.</p>
<p>Visiting this dry garden is supposed to <strong>encourage meditation.  </strong>It is a place of contemplation and meditative practice for monks who rake the rocks daily into different patterns.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson</strong> is that you can work very hard at something – and you should – but that it will be gone the next day. This doesn’t mean that we should work less hard but rather <strong>appreciate things while we do them and accept that they will end or disappear</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>A Wet Garden</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2068" style="width: 883px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2068" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=883%2C588&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="883" height="588" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2068" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, wet garden<br />© John Lander Photography</figcaption></figure>
<p>A wet garden is an Immersive and natural experience. Meditation and contemplation encouraged through strolling around the garden. The sound of the water and birds is meant to be calming.</p>
<p>This reveals the deep respect the Japanese have for the natural world, and the belief that lessons and enlightenment can be learned/attained through the natural world.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>Zen Buddhist complex and gardens</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> means <strong>peaceful dragon.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>A Visual of the Wet Garden</strong></h5>
<p>The wet garden has two small islands in lake. There is a small shrine on one of the small islands in the lake. It can be accessed through a bridge. This is a shrine to the Shinto goddess of luck.</p>
<p>Cherry trees abound on the island. The pond that attracts water birds.</p>
<h5><strong>A Visual of the Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>dry garden </strong>is carefully raked each day by the Buddhist monks<strong>.</strong> These meticulous arrangements of rocks and pebbles are circled around each rock formation in particular patterns. It is unclear if these patterns have a particular meaning.</p>
<p>In 2002, a research team at Kyoto University claimed that the garden’s rocks, when viewed from the proper angle, subconsciously evoked the outline of a branching tree.</p>
<p><strong>Other theories:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A tigress escorting her cubs across the snow</li>
<li>The Chinese character for “heart” or “mind”</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>The Influence of Zen Buddhist Principles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Restraint, simplicity, and honesty are held in esteem</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Immersion in nature (gardens)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Ryoan-ji was originally a Fujiwara aristocrat’s villa during the Heian Period. Later, a powerful warlord captured the villa and converted it to a Zen Buddhist temple in 1450 CE.</p>
<p>This was constructed for the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism that came from China in 1191 CE</p>
<p>Zen gardens are a principal concept of <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong>, which was a type of Buddhism that the elite practiced because it required ample time in the day for meditation, gardening, tea-drinking</p>

<h3><strong>300 BCE-1980 CE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1475" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=990%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>Trade greatly affected the development of Asian cultures and Asian art. Two major methods for international trade connected Asia. One was <strong>the Silk Route</strong> that linked Europe and Asia, connecting the Indian subcontinent to overland trade routes through Central Asia, terminating in X’ian, China. The second was the vast <strong>maritime networks</strong> that utilized seasonal monsoon winds to move trade among North Africa, West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and south China. These routes were the vital mechanism for the transmission of cultural ideas and practices, such as Buddhism, and of artistic forms, media, and styles across mainland and maritime Asia.</p>
<h5><strong>Religion and Culture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Buddhism</strong> was actively imported to Japan from Korea and China in the 7th and 8th centuries. It succeeded first in China, and then other countries, because of courtly patronage and similarities with local traditions.</p>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia were also home to <strong>foreign cultures and religions</strong>, including <strong>GrecoRoman</strong> cultures, <strong>Christianity</strong>, and most notably <strong>Islamic </strong>cultures from West and Central Asia. Islamic influence is particularly strong in India, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which were under at least partial control of Islamic sultanates during the second millennia CE. These regions have also been influenced by cultures and beliefs from West Asia and Europe. Today South and Southeast Asia are home to the world’s largest <strong>Muslim </strong>populations.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Chinese Buddhist sculpture</p>
<p><strong>Themes: </strong></p>
<p>Politics<br />
Propaganda<br />
Religion<br />
Place of worship<br />
Rulers</p>
<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>is located at<strong> Longmen Caves, in Luoyang, China.</strong> Made from hard, gray <strong>limestone </strong>the largest Buddha<strong> measures 57 feet. </strong>These were carved<strong> in situ</strong> into <strong>living rock</strong> as <strong>high relief. </strong>Here there are 2,300 caves and niches that extends for over a mile.</p>
<p>The Buddha and bodhisattvas display a new, softer, and rounder modeling, as well as facial expressions. Vajrapani and lokapala display a more engaging and animated musculature, with forceful poses. These would have been painted in brilliant blues, reds, browns, and golds.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p>This is a place of <strong>Buddhist worship.</strong></p>
<p>The patrons were emperors (and one empress) and this was the display of power and piety of these people. Rulers wielded Buddhism to affirm their piety, superiority, and tolerance.  Specifically, this revealed the strength and spirituality of Tang Dynasty. It was a metaphor for political power.</p>
<p>This arrangement with <strong>Buddha in the center</strong> emphasized a correct religious order.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Tang Dynasty was struggling to balance bureaucrats and aristocrats, who consistently posed a threat to the emperors. For emperors to sponsor productions of artworks such as these was to show that there was a likeness between the emperors and Buddha. Thus, aristocrats and bureaucrats should be subservient to the emperor, just as bodhisattvas and disciples were to Buddha.</p>
<p>This sculptural arrangement intentionally <strong>mirrored the political situation</strong> – one person is supreme.</p>

<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>contains in total almost 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, more than 60 stupas, and 2800 inscriptions.</p>
<p><strong>A Look at Fengxian Cave</strong></p>
<p>The specific cave we are examining is called Fengxian Cave.  Here 9 figures pose as a group.</p>
<p><strong>From Left to right: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Bodhisattva</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Vairocana Buddha</strong> (Buddha who represents all the infinite wisdom in the universe),</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Bodhisattva</strong></li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A bodhisattva</strong> are Buddhists who do not pass on to nirvana, but who stays to help.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrapani</strong> are Chinese guardians of Buddha, who wields thunderbolts. The violence is justified only if there is a threat made to Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>Lokapala</strong> are heavenly kings who watch over one of each of the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>There are many <strong>smaller figures of deities, monks, and donors</strong> surrounding the nine main figures.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Most of the carvings date between the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century and the middle of the 8<sup>th</sup> century (Northern Wei through early Tang). Wei had moved capital to Luoyang in 494 CE.</p>
<p><strong>Tang Dynasty</strong> was considered the age of Buddhism in China</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddhism and Confucianism each vied for power over emperors.</li>
<li>Many Chinese, Indian, Central Asian, and Southeast Asian monks traveled through Asia, spreading Buddhism’s messages.</li>
<li>Alternating periods of Chinese Buddhism’s popularity or lack thereof prevented constant flow of work.</li>
<li>Largest period of construction (and the construction of Fengxian Caves) was sponsored by Emperor Gaozong, and his wife and <strong>the one and only empress of China, Empress Wu.</strong></li>

<p>Sailendra Dynasty. c. 750–842 centuries</p>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong>, in <strong>Central Java, Indonesia</strong>, is made from <strong>volcanic-stone masonry</strong>. It is <strong>the largest Buddhist temple in the world</strong> and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is 300 years older than Angkor Wat and 400 years older than the European Cathedrals. The Indonesian temple was buried under volcanic ash and overgrown with vegetation until discovered by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Raffles in 1814. A team of Dutch archaeologists restored the site in 1907–11. A second restoration was completed by 1983.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106" style="width: 783px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2106" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198-Details.jpg?resize=783%2C517&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="783" height="517" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198-Details.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198-Details.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2106" class="wp-caption-text">Detail © Edifice/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visiting the temple requires circumambulating through the corridors. It is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the Four Noble Truths (also known as the dharma and the law). This helps to understand samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>Climbing up successive terraces allows for understanding the transition from the lowest manifestations of reality, through a series of spiritual regions, toward the enlightenment at the summit which allows unrestricted views of the mountains, offering a liberating feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p>One <strong>enters on the east gate</strong>, and <strong>reads from left to right</strong>, moving in a <strong>clockwise direction</strong> around the monument. Almost 5 km of <strong>carved bas reliefs</strong> educate the illiterate according to Mahayana Buddhism texts. These texts deal with the self-discovery and education of the bodhisattva, conceived as being with compassionate, and fully devoted to the salvation of all creatures.</p>
<p>The stories from Buddha’s life, Jataka and Avadana illustrate lessons on morality, karma and merit that distinguished the enlightened creature.</p>
<p>Buddhist religion, philosophy and cosmology is woven into the architecture of the Borobudur. The temple is the symbol of Mount Meru, which is considered the center of the universe in Indian cosmology.</p>
<p>Based on the teachings of Buddha the temple represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Four Noble Truths</li>
<li>the Noble Eightfold Path</li>
<li>the three realms of existence: Kāmadhātu, Rūpadhātu and Arūpadhātu</li>
</ul>
<p>These help to guide the visitors  to follow the spiritual teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Kāmadhātu</strong> <strong>(Desire Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>160 reliefs based on the text of Mahakarmavibhangga, which is about the law of cause and effect (karma).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rūpadhātu (Form Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scenes depicting mankind’s consciousness about the meaning of life through reliefs on a four sides gallery, both inside and out.</li>
<li>To view in the correct order, one must walk around clockwise four times and observe both upper and lower reliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arūpadhātu (Formless Realm) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reliefs depicted at the top illustrating Enlightenment (Nirvāṇa) which requires an almost five kilometer walk clockwise, ten times, to view correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Other Forms of Decoration</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>birds</li>
<li>flowers</li>
<li>mythical beings like Kāla above the temple entrance</li>
<li>Makara mythical being with an elephant trunk and an open mouth from which the head of a lion emerges are at the base of the gate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is shaped as a stepped grey andesite pyramid with 3 levels—a square base, a middle level of five square terraces, and an upper level of three circular terraces—totaling 9 lesser sections. The number 9 which represents the end of a cycle in the decimal system, which originated from the Indian subcontinent as early as 3000 BC is mystic in Buddhism and Hinduism. Important Buddhist rituals usually involve 9 monks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107" style="width: 786px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2107 " src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=786%2C520&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="786" height="520" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2107" class="wp-caption-text">Buddha © Dallas and John Heaton/Free Agents 1 Limited/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The historical Buddha had 9 virtues</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accomplished</li>
<li>Perfectly Enlightened</li>
<li>Endowed with knowledge and Conduct</li>
<li>Well-spoken</li>
<li>the Knower of worlds</li>
<li>the Guide Unsurpassed of men to be tamed</li>
<li>the Teacher of gods and men</li>
<li>Enlightened</li>
<li>Blessed</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>3 circular terraces carry small stupas</strong>, crowned at the centre of the summit by a large, circular, bell-shaped stupa, 115 feet (35 metres) above the base. The bottom plinth encasement that obscures an entire series of reliefs consists of a massive heap of stone pressed up against the original structure. It was probably added to hold together the bottom story, which began to spread under the pressure of the immense weight of earth and stone accumulated above.</p>
<p>The lowest level, which is partially hidden, contains reliefs of earthly desires, illustrating “the realm of feelings/desires”, <strong>the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe</strong>. It portrays the law of cause and effect. For example, if you like gossiping, you might be reborn with an ugly appearance.</p>
<p>The next level is a 13-foot-wide corridor open to the sky and adorned with bas-reliefs that depict “the realm of forms” through events in the life of the historical Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas. There are 2 registers: the balustrade depicting fables about altruism.</p>
<p>Opposite the balustrade is the main wall where the Jatakas stories are located.</p>
<p><strong>Lalitavistara,</strong> a set of 120 reliefs on the first platform, depict Prince Siddharta’s life from birth to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Queen Maya riding  in a horse carriage is retreating to Lumbini garden to give birth to Prince Siddhartha. In the nativity scene, Queen Maya&#8217;s depiction recalls the tree spirits or yakshinis. These spirits are are often shown as beautiful and voluptuous, with a flywhisk in right hand, fleshy cheeks, wide hips, narrow waists, broad shoulders, knotted hair and exaggerated, spherical breasts. According to legend, the infant stood and took seven steps. With each step, a lotus flower appeared, to prevent his tiny feet from touching the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Here is the Story</strong></p>
<p>“Prince Siddharta was born to King Sudhodana and Queen Maya of the Sakya clan who reigned in Kosala, India, around the fifth century BC. One day Queen Maya had a dream of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was interpreted by priests as a sign that the couple would bear a son, who would become either a world ruler or a Buddha. The king preferred him to be the world ruler, so he confined the prince in the palace and indulged him in sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>As fate had it, one day the prince went out of his palace and he saw a sick person, an old person, a corpse, and a monk. Siddharta realized that he, too, would become old, sick, and die. Later, he renounced his mundane life and embarked on his search for true happiness. After learning from several spiritual teachers, and practicing severe ascetism for six years, he finally meditated under a bodhi tree. Here he attained enlightenment. Because of his compassion for fellow humans, he revealed the path to achieve unconditional happiness.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Jataka tales</strong> are about the 500 Bodhisattvas, the alternating human and animal forms in which Buddha was reincarnated before he was born as Prince Siddhartha and attained enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>Animals perform self-sacrifices for other beings</strong>. “A sad monkey hugging a buffalo’s neck is the story of real friendship. One day a monkey had a problem. An ogre wanted to eat him. Devastated, the monkey told his buffalo friend about his fate. The buffalo comforted the monkey, saying that he would offer himself instead. What’s more, the buffalo’s body was bigger. The buffalo just asked themonkey to send his best wishes to his relatives. Then they both met the ogre. Touched by thekindness of the buffalo, the ogre dismissed his plan to eat either of them.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avadana (Noble Deeds)</strong> are similar to Jataka, but the main figures are legendary people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sudhana’s quest for enlightenment</strong></p>
<p>He was an Indian youth, maybe a merchant’s son seeking bodhi (enlightenment). He takes a pilgrimage on his quest for enlightenment and studies under 52 “teachers”: a doctor teaches him compassion for the ill, children playing teach him about simple happiness,…</p>
<h5><strong>Detachment from the Physical World</strong></h5>
<p>The upper level illustrates “the realm of formlessness,” or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration, but lining the terraces are <strong>72 bell-shaped stupas, many containing a statue of the Buddha, partly visible through the lattice stonework</strong>. The <strong>504 Buddha statues are shaped to express 6 different mudras</strong> (hand positions).</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Buddha Hand Gestures and Significance</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right hand across right knee symbolizing the summons of the Earth Goddess.</li>
<li>Right hand open with the face of the hand facing upwards – a symbolic gesture of loving kindness by the act of giving.</li>
<li>Both hands folded on his lap symbolic for meditation.</li>
<li>Right hand raised upwards with the face of the hand facing the audience – a symbolic gesture of dispelling of fear.</li>
<li>Right hand slightly lifted upwards with the tips of his thumb and index finger touching each other – a symbolic gesture of preaching the Dharma.</li>
<li>Both hands raised in front of the center of the upper body, touching with his right ring finger his left index finger – by far the most important symbolic gesture, for it represents the turning of the wheel of the Dharma.</li>
<li>The archways allow people to access the higher levels are decorated with pre-Buddhist elements,  such as the fearsome face and open mouth of Kala. This is a Hindu deity from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, In Javanese mythology, Batara. Kala is the god of destruction.</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Symbolism of the Mandala</strong></h5>
<p>The temple’s plan suggests a <strong>mandala</strong>, one of the richest visual objects in Buddhism. A mandala is a symbolic picture of the universe painted on a wall or scroll, or simply created with colored sands on a table. It represents an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation. Each object in the palace has significance, representing an aspect of wisdom or reminding the meditator of a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The <strong>mandala&#8217;s purpose is to help transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones</strong> and to <strong>assist with healing. </strong> The entire sacred manmade mountain of chiseled gray andesite is a giant stupa. On the topmost terrace, the main stupa contained an unfinished image of Buddha with the hands not fully carved that was hidden from the spectator’s view, symbolized the indefinable ultimate spiritual state.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>Progressively the reliefs on the terraces become more static. The sensuous roundness of the forms of the figures is not abated but, in the design, great emphasis is laid upon horizontals and verticals and upon static, formal enclosures of repeated figures and gestures. At the summit all movement disappears.</p>
<p>The circular design enclosing the stupa, between the reliefs are decorative scroll panels, and a hundred monster-head waterspouts carrying off the tropical rainwater.</p>
<p>The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar.</p>
<h5><strong>The Javanese Variation</strong></h5>
<p>Although the origin of the temple is based on Indian mythology and Buddhist iconography, one can see the Javanese influence. The statues are less refined and have been recreated in the local perception of beauty. This is the way Buddhism was manifested in Java during the Sailendra dynasty.</p>
<p>Based on Indian influences and Mahāyāna Buddhism, arriving via China during Tang dynasty (618-906), this became the Buddhism of Java.</p>
<p>Sailendra dynasty shared their power with the Hindu dynasty Sanjaya. For example, the construction of the Kalasan temple – illustrates, that, apart from its religious function, the Borobudur also formed an important expression of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>The congregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage paying reverence to the stupa. This is achieved by circumambulating and keeping it on the right. The visitor is transformed and educated, while climbing through the levels of Borobudur. The encountering of illustrations of progressively more profound tales from Jataka and Avadana is achieved in a  similar way to the very early frescoes of the Ajanta Caves in India.</p>
<p>Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.</p>
<p>Vesak, the “Buddha Day” ceremony, occurs once a year during a full moon. thousands of Buddhist monks walk in solemn procession to Borobudur to commemorate the Buddha’s birth, death, and enlightenment. Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Angkor Wat, in Siem Reap, Cambodia</strong> is the largest religious monument in the world. It was <strong>built for the patron King Suryavarman</strong> II (1113–1145/50 C.E.) and dedicated to the Hindu god <strong>Vishnu</strong>, one of the three principal gods in the Hindu pantheon, along with <strong>Shiva and Brahma</strong>. Vishnu is known as the protector.</p>
<p>It is believed that <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> was also to house the king after death and used as a mausoleum.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> comes from the Khmer language, the official language of Cambodia. It means City Temple.</p>
<p><strong>Siem Reap</strong> was once the capital of the Khmer empire, <strong>then known as Angko</strong>r. From the 800s to the 1300s it was a prosperous hydraulic facility that collected monsoon waters from the rainy season, in huge basins. This elevated flooding, and protected plantations during drought.</p>
<p>Merchants and traders of gold and spices brought Hinduism and later Buddhism. Business opportunities caused people to stay in the region</p>
<p>Since Angkor itself was the technical source of the life-giving agricultural water controlled by the king, it was regarded by the Khmer with religious reverence. Its temples and palaces were an expression of that and at the same time an essential part of its supernatural mechanism.</p>
<p>Royal intercession by numerous ceremonies, some of which re-enacted the primal marriage of Hindu divinity and native earth spirit on the pattern of ancient folk cult, ensured the continuing gift of the waters of heaven.</p>
<p>The king, an earthly image of his god, was the intermediary who ensured that his kingdom would continue to receive divine benevolence in the form of water in controlled quantities.</p>
<p>Courtiers played roles both religious and administrative for the king, who believed that after his death he would be united with his patron deity. Dedicatory statues were often set up in his chief temple to commemorate his divinization.</p>
<p>The Khmer kings were tied to the city, even as they changed religions. The city was transformed using both Hindi and Mahayana Buddhist architecture and artistic style layers beneath the surface of the temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large moat and a high wall surround Angkor Wat on all sides, which are longer than one kilometer.</p>
<p>Inside the temple develops on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new enclosure, formed of galleries, pierced with monumental porches on all four sides and provided with corner towers</li>
<li>a <strong>second floor</strong> repeating the same arrangement</li>
<li>a <strong>central tower</strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries staggered and interconnected by cruciform galleries</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>temple mountain</strong> was a Southeast Asian invention in architecture. It represented a union between the gods and the reigning king. The capital, a square measuring 4 kilometers on each side was lined with a double rise of land. Here two axial avenues crossed ending in a natural hill in the center.</p>
<p>The five stone towers symbolized the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru, the mythical home of Hindu and Buddhist gods. It was also considered an <strong>axis-mundi</strong> or a world axis that connects heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In his city, the king could intercede and re-enact the marriage of the Hindu divinity and the earth spirit to ensure the continuing gift of waters from the heaven</p>
<h5><strong>Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The temples continued to multiple, with each sovereign trying to outdo the next.  The small temple of <strong>Banteay Srei</strong>, built in 967, is located 20 kilometers north-east of Angkor. It is surrounded by a low-rise enclosure that is pierced by entrance pavilions and bordered by a moat. With three towers consisting of pink sandstone, this is the first temple to use relief sculptures to illustrate Indian legends. This is a prelude to classical Khumer style. Note the reliefs of <strong>devatas </strong>(gods of Hindu epics such as Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and the <strong>tympanums</strong> depicting Hindu myths, such as the rain of Indra.</p>
<h5><strong>Rich in Decoration</strong></h5>
<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> over a thousand dancing <strong>apsaras</strong> (female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) unfold on the walls of the different courts and on the pilasters. Dressed in a bell skirt from which are two large pieces of cloth at the waist, they are lavishly adorned with bracelets, armbands, necklaces and earrings, and extravagant hairstyles.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Bas-Relief Sculptures</strong></h5>
<p>The greatest achievement of the <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> sculptors has been reached in the tens of meters long bas-reliefs of the galleries of the second such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk</em></strong> or <strong><em>Heavens and Hells</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Heavens and Hells</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></h5>

<li>dramatic groupings</li>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Myth </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Churning of the Milk</em></strong> is a Hindu myth about the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil, as well as light and darkness. Due to this struggle twelve precious things are lost in the ocean.</p>
<p>The god Vishnu thought to use the holy mountain Mt. Mandara as a churning stick, surrounded by the serpent king (naga). This was tugged between the demons and the gods. They pulled with all their might! The churning stick stirred the waters of the milky sea for 1000 years&#8212; before recovering the <strong>amrita</strong>, the elixir of eternal life. The foam from the churning produces apsaras<em>,</em> who appear on both sides of Vishnu. Once the elixir was released, the supreme god of the Vedes, Indra descended to catch it and to save the world from the demons.</p>

<p>After the death of Suryavarman II, the Champa (the people of nowadays Vietnam) occupied the Khmer kingdom for four years (1145 to 1149).</p>
<p>Jayavarman VII achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>liberated his country and restored order.</li>
<li>conquered Champa (Vietnam), Laos, Thailand and Burma achieving the maximum extent of the Khmer kingdom</li>
<li>enthroned in 1181</li>
<li>reorganized the Khmer country</li>
<li>built a road network linking the provinces to the capital and lined them with lodgings for travelers</li>
<li>built hospitals</li>
<li>changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahāyāna).</li>
<li>raised temples dedicated to the worship of his parents</li>
<li>1186, that of Ta Prohm, in Angkor itself, dedicated to his mother deified under the aspect of a female counterpart bodhisattva.</li>
<li>1191, the temple of Preah Khan of Angkor, in memory of his father in the aspect of Bodhisattva &#8220;Lord of the World&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Work in Progress</strong></h5>
<p>Simultaneously, he had to restore <strong>Angkor Thom</strong> the capital itself, destroyed and pillaged by the Chams. It used to be centered on the Baphuon, which was more than a hundred years old.  Jayavarman VII recentered it on a new temple-mountain, the Bayon and surrounded it by a moat and a high wall of stone. The new city, Angkor Thom, was &#8211; like the previous ones &#8211; enclosed in a vast quadrilateral, each side of which was oriented in relation to a cardinal point. Four triumphal ways (north-south and east-west) cut it into quarters.</p>
<p>The Buddhist cosmology inspired the symbolism and dispositions of the great foundations (Angkor Thom, Preah Khan, etc.). The architecture (plans and elevations of the temples, construction processes) and sculpture (iconography, aesthetics, adjustments) of the style of the center of its new capital, Bàyon break with four centuries of stylistic evolution and mark its end.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p>Construction was not random. By combining Brahmanic notions and Buddhist ideas the architectural purpose was the glorification of the king, his deification, and his identification with the empire. Jayavarman VII, converted to Buddhism, found satisfactory solutions present the capital as the center of the world of the gods, where the king lived as equal of the gods and the protector of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>moats were oceans that encircled the world, enclosing the mountain ranges that border it</li>
<li>doors, surmounted by towers adorned with the deified face repeated four times, facing each cardinal point</li>
<li>gave access to roads lined on both sides of a hundred and eight giants of stone holding a colossal naga</li>
<li>theme of churning of the ocean, myth of creation, and that of the rainbow unites heaven and earth.</li>
<li>In the center, the Bayon, symbolic temple-mountain with a circular interior and radiant reminiscent of the Buddhist stupas, provided 50 faces, with the &#8220;smile of Angkor&#8221;, which one finds the echo in the countless statuary of this time.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Angkor Wat as a Mandala</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>mandala </strong>or circle in Sanskirt, is a spiritual geometric configuration of temples in Buddhism. This allows for harmony with the universe by aligning with the planets, sunrise, and sunset. <strong>Angkor’s</strong> central axis through the temple’s main tower, aligns with the morning sun of the Spring Equinox.</p>
<h5><strong>Destruction, Change and Abandonment</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>In 1234, Jayavaram VIII, who succeeded two Buddhist Kings, destroyed Angkor and all effigies of Buddha. He was an iconoclast operating at a very large scale. In total tens of thousands of Buddha images were defaced.</p>
<p>At the end of the 13th century, the definitive adoption of Theravāda Buddhism led to a radical change in architectural traditions and ended all major construction programs. Advocating a simpler way of life, the Theravada Buddhism made <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> the Buddhist center of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Around 1431 a new Thai attack destroyed the hydraulic system on which the economy of the kingdom was based. Shortly after, the royal court abandoned <strong>Angkor.</strong>               <u></u></p>

<p><em><strong>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</strong></em><strong> </strong>is also known as <em><strong>Jahangir Enthroned on an Hourglass</strong></em>. This work<strong> on paper, by artist Bichitra</strong> is comprised of <strong>watercolor, gold and ink</strong> and measures <strong>10 inches tall.</strong></p>
<p>It is one of the <strong>symbolic paintings</strong> of Jahangir&#8217;s reign, eulogizing the power status of the contemporary dynasty. One of the many novel expression methods, the symbolism is distinctly handled.</p>
<p>To view you must concentrate on the <strong>aesthetics of composition</strong>, <strong>color palette</strong>, and a manipulative variation of <strong>figural sizes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong>, the painter, depicted various <strong>vegetal forms</strong> along with the <strong>calligraphic</strong> verses on the border. This trademark work combining many regional influences, illustrates Bichitra’s use of <strong>cross-cultural motifs</strong> to convey Mughal principles. Jahangir accepted European entry into the Indian subcontinent, which brought in <strong>western motifs in Indian art</strong>. This included Mughal miniatures are a part of larger books.</p>
<p>The thick and colorful <strong>floral border</strong> on the painting defines the Jahangir-era of Mughal art. The folio, as part of Muraqqa, establishes the spiritual trait of Jahangir’s personality by portraying the Sufi Sheikh as a prior figure after himself.</p>
<h5><strong>The Main Characters</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-846" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=673%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="673" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=673%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 673w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=197%2C300&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=768%2C1169&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The painting comprises five human figures of a reputed status, in decreasing order of visual size. The largest figure is that of <strong>King Jahangir</strong>, while the man in front of him is <strong>Sufi Sheikh Hussain</strong>, in a dimension little shorter than him. The king is adorned with jewelry as opposed to pale garb of the sheikh.</p>
<p>King Jahangir is handing over a book to the Sufi Sheikh Hussain, which he accepts in a shawl, avoiding the physical contact, as an imperial protocol.</p>
<p>The figure below the spiritual leader is an <strong>Ottoman sultan</strong>, followed by <strong>English King James I</strong>. Ottoman sultan&#8217;s turban-tied headdress distinguishes him as a foreigner to the Mughal court, while he awaits his chance to greet Jahangir. King James I, in his royal attire, gazes out of the painting, which is a typical style of European art.</p>
<p>The last figure is that of <strong>the artist</strong> himself, <strong>Bichitra</strong>. Despite the significance over the form of the King’s figure, the ochre-chrome yellow garb of Bichitra grabs the attention compulsively. However, the attire&#8217;s fashion indicates that he was a Hindu artist in the Mughal court. He is holding a miniature painting, which suggests his profession.</p>
<h5><strong>Adaptations of European Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from these, the other flying semi-human forms are <strong>putti figures</strong>, which are European-influenced characters.</p>
<p><strong>The halo</strong> behind the Jahangir’s head, and <strong>hourglass</strong>, are further adaptations of European forms. Concentric in kind, glaring flames around the head seemingly recognize his sun-like illuminated and authoritative demeanor.</p>
<p>At the same time, the crescent moon at the lower arc of the halo is a prevalent representation of spiritual enlightenment in Jain paintings. Symbolically, the crescent moon also narrates the endless cycle of day and night.</p>
<p><strong>King Jahangir</strong> is seated on a large and ornate hourglass. On the putti on the hourglass are engraving with an inscription that reads, “Allah is great. O Shah may the span of your reign be a thousand years”.</p>
<p>The hourglass is an emblematic attribute of the beginning of the new Islamic millennium, it begins with the rule of a knowledgeable Mughal ruler.</p>
<p>From these forms we can infer that Bichitra had been studying European artworks that were accepted by the king as gifts.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism</strong></h5>
<p>While figures are naturalistic and convincingly real, space itself is tipped <strong>upwards and flattened</strong>. A few areas are painted in gradual tonal values, while the rest is in flat application of colors. Artist has utilized a <strong>colorful palette</strong> with incredibly precise and intricate detailing. Notably, the division of backdrop helps in acquiring a rhythmic gaze over the work.</p>
<p>An ornate lower half, which apparently is a Persianate carpet, is replete with <strong>abstract, repetitive, and naturalistic design.</strong> In addition, the artist has neglected linear perspective to feature the content significantly.</p>
<h5><strong>Frames Within Frames</strong></h5>
<p>The painting is enclosed in a <strong>group of rectangular frames</strong> that show a varying <strong>floral and calligraphic designs</strong>. Bordering with repetitive and small decorative cartouches, the background of the folio has floral arabesque. These <strong>floral motifs</strong> are inspired by the local flowers of the region.</p>
<p>At the cusp of the painting, on the vertical edges, the band depicts a calligraphic verse praising the king. The lower band expresses, “Though outwardly Shahs stand before him, he fixes his gaze on dervishes.”</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mughal miniatures</strong> were often a part of a more comprehensive book project called <strong>Muraqqa</strong>. Murraqas describes lives of Mughal kings or elites. They were accessible to the selected and not common men.</p>
<p>After the volume was written, it would be given to an artist with secluded pages to illustrate the relevant narratives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this folio was to render a spiritual and wise image of noble Mughal King Jahangir. As he preferred a spiritual Sufi Sheikh over the kings of the world, he is indicated to be a grand sovereign of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Mughal paintings are said to have used <strong>gold, silver, and lapiz lazuli</strong>, among other hues, for rendition. The usage of material depended on the project and the role it played over the larger mass. The <strong>colors</strong> were generally obtained from <strong>local natural resources</strong>. For example, white was made by grinding the conch, while black from the lamp residue.</p>
<p>In addition, Mughal kings followed greater political propaganda to disperse the might of the Mughal ruler. It also displayed Jahangir’s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety’s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.</p>
<h5><strong>Traditions</strong></h5>
<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance</strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.</p>
<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him</strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp’s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous <em>Hamzanama</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hamzanama </em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers</strong>.</p>
<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir’s court painters</p>
<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong> (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to <em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em> under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases. <em>Baburnama</em>, <em>Akbarnama</em>, <em>Tujuk-I- Jahangir</em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing ateliers</strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.</p>
<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.</strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved</strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette</strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts</strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.</p>
<p>During Akbar’s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Bichitra was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir’s reign.</p>

<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in <strong>Agra, Uttar Pradesh, in Northern India</strong>, is an ancient <strong>Indian mausoleum</strong> representing exquisite <strong>Indo-Islamic architecture</strong> that measures <strong>240 feet</strong> across and sits on <strong>42 acres</strong>. The building is made with <strong>stone masonry</strong> and <strong>marble</strong>, along with <strong>an inlay of precious and semiprecious stones</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is an ancient Indian mausoleum representing exquisite Indo-Islamic architecture. Considered as one of the seven man-made wonders of the world, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is known as the <strong>Crown of the Palace</strong>. Originally, it was known as Rauza-i-munawwara, which means illuminated tomb.</p>
<p>Projecting unique beauty, the mausoleum is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb. Comprising calligraphic decoration in precious gemstones, it is an exceptional Mughal structure in white marble. Many kinds of research on the yellowing of the marble have been conducted in light of global warming, resulting in strict restrictions over the surrounding vicinity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is not a singular marvel, rather it is a large complex of twin mosques, exemplary gardens, and marvelous gates. In 1983, UNESCO designated the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> and the complex as World Heritage site. A thoughtful blend of Persian, Turkic, and Indian styles, it is one of the finest instances of Mughal art and architecture.</p>

<p>The Mughal kingdom had expanded its rule over vast areas of northern and central India. Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces. <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is situated in the center of a large complex on 42 acres.  The complex consists of the main tomb flanked by twin mosques—they are identical in size and rendition—that face the tomb. It also consists of a guest house and beautiful gardens called Chahar bagh, which used the Persian style.</p>
<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone</strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna River, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.</p>
<p>The <strong>Taj Mahal is built on a square and raised platform</strong> or a plinth. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of eight paradises, rendering the plan octagonally. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber. The onion-shaped dome is flanked by four minarets at the four corners of the plinth. Mounted with a finial and a crescent moon, the dome is a golden spot of wonder. At the lower lever, four smaller-sized domes surrounding the central dome. Each smaller dome is comprised of a <em>chhatri </em>(kiosk), enclosing a balcony.</p>
<p>The <strong>arched gate to enter the tomb</strong> is called <em><strong>iwan</strong></em>. It is framed by a rectangular and decorated surface called <em>pishtaq</em>. The gates and other walls project <strong>chamfered corners</strong>, a peculiar style of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the four minarets are tilted away from the central dome, as a precautionary act to avoid damage to the main structure, especially during an occurrence of a natural calamity. Minarets also have a <em><strong>chhatri</strong></em><em> </em>and a staircase to reach the top. They are associated with the religious duty of calling for daily prayers. The <em><strong>muezzin</strong></em>, the official assigned the announcing duty, calls the public for the <em><strong>namaz</strong></em><em> </em>or prayer from these minarets.</p>
<p>The central chamber places the two cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz. Shah Jahan died thirty years after his wife. Mumtaj died after giving birth to their 14th offspring in 1631. The real sarcophagi are safely stored at the lower level. The sarcophagi are ornate with calligraphy. The surface calligraphic verses from the Quran are inlaid in precious stones. The technique is known as Pietra dura, which uses cut and polished colored stones. The verses refer to the paradise and day of judgment, wherein God royally and dutifully rewards the faithful.</p>
<p>The tomb shows many floral patterns, as animal or human figures are prohibited, due to Islam protocols. In addition, the <em><strong>jali</strong></em><em> </em>or a mesh decorative and lapidary is frequently observed.</p>
<p>Composed unconventionally, as opposed to other Mughal or Islamic tombs, the surface of the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is wondrously composed to derive an impeccable play of light and shadow.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is a mausoleum and it serves a funerary function. Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.</p>
<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan. Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of compassion and royalty.</p>
<p>As it is built on the raised platform, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural metaphor for Paradise. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is the symbol of unconditioned love. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the<strong> Taj Mahal</strong> has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaz by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.</p>
<p>Significantly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> emphasizes the power vested in royal Mughal patrons. Shah Jahan decided to build it in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, bringing many Persian artists to India. The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of miniature paintings. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing and being influenced by indigenous Indian art. Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.</p>
<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s</strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of <strong>Islamic and Indian architecture</strong>.  Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule. Many motifs from Hindu culture had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style</strong>, some <strong>plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Mughals were Islamic rulers in India – known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. It is mentioned that Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, which allowed for easy access to water, Agra was known as a “riverfront” city.</p>
<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent.</p>
<p>The five principal elements of the complex, which includes the main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”, a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.</p>
<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> welcomes millions of worldwide tourists every year. After the Taj Mahal was listed a one of the seven man-made wonders of the world, its popularity has grown by leaps and bounds. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns. This has resulted in many new rules and regulations for visitors. Shah Jahan erected this wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection. This was a ground-breaking achievement.  It has continued to draw crowds to Agra to receive a glimpse of architectural beauty. Even after four hundred years Taj Mahal continues to inspire great awe.</p>
<p>During this time in history, the Indian continent observed an influx of Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, conducting business with Indian counterparts. The presence of Europeans also appears in many Mughal paintings, proving their acceptance in Mughal courts. Shah Jahan was a promoter of arts and culture. This did not pass onto the next Mughal ruler and his son Aurangzeb. This led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving ground for the British to take charge by the 18th century.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.2 Purpose and Audience in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1475" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=990%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Sophisticated Neolithic and Bronze Age civilizations thrived across Asia, including the Indus Valley civilization in Pakistan and India, the <strong>Yangshao and Longshan cultures</strong> and <strong>Shang dynasty in China</strong>, the <strong>Dongson culture in Southeast Asia</strong>, and the <strong>Yayoi and Kofun</strong> cultures <strong>in Japan</strong>.</p>
<p>The people and cultures of these regions were diverse, but prehistoric and ancient societies based in key regions (e.g., the Indus River Valley, Gangetic Plain, and Yellow River) developed core social and religious beliefs that were embraced across larger cultural spheres. This helped to shape the regional identities of people within Asia.</p>
<h5><strong>Shared Cultural Ideas</strong></h5>
<p>The core cultural centers in Asia became home to many of the world’s great civilizations and ruling dynasties, including Gupta India, Han China, Khmer Cambodia, and Heian Japan. The shared cultural ideas in each region and civilization gave birth to visual traditions that employed related subjects, functions, materials, and artistic styles.</p>
<h5><strong>Religion and Philosophy</strong></h5>
<p>Many of the world’s great <strong>religious and philosophic traditions</strong> developed in South and East Asia. Distinctive religious art forms developed in this region to support the beliefs and practices of these religions.</p>
<p>The ancient Indic worldview that dominated South Asia differentiated earthly and cosmic realms of existence. Certain sites were recognized for beings sacred, with an understanding of time and life as cyclic.</p>
<p>The <strong>religions</strong> that developed in this region—<strong>Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism</strong>, and numerous <strong>folk religions</strong>—all worked within this worldview and sought spiritual development, spiritual release, or divine union through various religious methodologies and social practices. The Indic worldview was also grafted onto the preexisting animistic and popular beliefs in Southeast Asia during several waves of importation and Indian attempts at colonization.</p>
<h5><strong>Art and Religion</strong></h5>
<p>The practice of the indigenous Asian religions necessitated the development of novel art and architectural forms to support them. Uniquely Asian art forms include iconic images used in Buddhist and Hindu traditions. It also incorporates elaborate narrative and iconographic compositions created in sculptures, textiles, and wall paintings. These are used to ornament shrines, temples, and caves.</p>
<p>There are also Buddhist stupa and monastic complexes, and Hindu temples. <strong>Raigo </strong>scenes are images that are associated with Pure Land Buddhism, where Amid Buddha meets the dead and takes them to the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>Then, there are relaxing Zen rock gardens, sacred spaces for Zen monks to perform their daily practice.  Zen ink painting also began in Zen monasteries.</p>
<h5><strong>Figural Imagery</strong></h5>
<p>Religious practices associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism are iconic. Figural imagery of divinities and revered teachers plays a prominent role in religious practice. The wealth of Buddhist imagery in Asia alone would rival, if not surpass, the wealth of Christian imagery in medieval Europe.</p>
<p>Figural imagery associated with Asian religious art may be found in temples or shrine settings or may inhabit conceptual landscapes and palaces of ideal Buddhist worlds.</p>
<p>These images also appear in mandalas. The word means “circle” and these works can be made in sand, or as thangka paintings on cotton or silk. Figural subjects are common in Indian and East Asian painting</p>
<p>East Asian religions emphasize the interconnectedness of humans with both the <strong>natural </strong>world and the <strong>spirit</strong> world. <strong>Daoism</strong>, with its almost antisocial focus, thrives on living in harmony with nature. The <strong>Dao</strong>, and <strong>Confucianism</strong>, are more of an ethical system of behaviors rather than a religion. All three were developed in China in the <strong>5th century BCE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhism</strong>, which arrived in China in the early centuries of the Common Era, shared clear affinities with the indigenous Chinese religions through its focus on <strong>nature, interconnectedness</strong>, and <strong>appropriate behavior</strong>. Traditions in Korea were heavily influenced by China and incorporate Confucian, Buddhist, and local shamanistic beliefs and practices. The <strong>ancient Japanese</strong> landscape was alive and inhabited by animistic nature spirits, whose veneration forms the basis of the <strong>Shinto</strong> religion.</p>
<h5><strong>Courtly and Secular Art</strong></h5>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia have rich traditions of courtly and secular art forms that employ local subjects and styles. In India, regional painting styles developed to illustrate <strong>mythical and historical subjects</strong>, and <strong>poetic texts</strong> documented court life.</p>
<p>In China and Japan, a new genre of <strong>literati painting</strong> developed among the educated elite. Literati paintings often reveal the <strong>nonprofessional</strong> artist’s exploration of <strong>landscape </strong>subjects, which are frequently juxtaposed with <strong>poetry</strong>. Chinese societies also developed a hierarchical and differentiated society that encouraged appropriate social behaviors that are expressed in art and architecture.</p>
<p>The term “secular” is a bit misleading when describing Asian art, as religious ideas or content frequently are carried over into secular art forms. For example, Hindu deities depicted in Ragamala painting, associated with melodies in India. Or think of Zen Buddhist sensibilities applied to ceramic production and flower arranging in Japan.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Architecture from these regions is frequently religious in function. <strong>Islamic architecture</strong> in South and Southeast Asia takes two major forms: <strong>secular </strong>(forts and palaces) and <strong>religious </strong>(mosques and tombs). Islamic mosques are decorated with nonfigural imagery, including calligraphy and vegetal forms. All mosques have a Qibla wall, which faces the direction of Mecca, home of the Kaaba. This wall is ornamented with an empty mihrab, which serves as a niche for prayer.</p>

<p>The<strong> <em>Great Stupa at Sanchi</em> </strong>in<strong> Madhya Pradesh, India </strong>is a work of<strong> stone masonry </strong>with<strong> sandstone on the dome. </strong>The initial monastic center started with the original stupa (Stupa1) + monolithic pillar built by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (reigned circa 269-232 BC) in the 3rd century BC.</p>
<p><strong>Sanchi Stupa’s outstanding importance include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large hemispherical dome crowned with a triple stone umbrella (chattras-Buddha stays under a chakra as royalty does) surrounded by a square railing</li>
<li>Around the 1st century CE under the Shungas</li>
<li>The stupa was later enlarged and encased in stone</li>
<li>The four magnificently carved gateways called toranas were added at the cardinal points.</li>
<li>The square posts of the entrances support three curved architraves with scrolled ends completely covered with relief sculptures</li>
<li><strong>Depict Jatakas (stories of the Buddha&#8217;s earlier incarnations, Bodhisattavas), </strong></li>
<li><strong>Scenes from the life of the historical Buddha </strong></li>
<li><strong>Buddhist aniconic symbols. </strong></li>
<li>A stone-paved processional path at the ground level enclosed by a balustrade and accessed through the four gateways</li>
<li>A second higher terrace, also enclosed by a railing, is approached by a double staircase.</li>
<li>Represents the Buddha, the path to Enlightenment, a mountain, and the universe</li>
<li>Following the decline of Indian Buddhism, the site decayed; rediscovered in the 19th century</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Great Stupa at Sanchi</em></strong> acknowledges <strong>early fertility symbols</strong> associated with the vitality of the <strong>fruit-bearing tree.</strong> At each end of the ornate torahs (gates) three yakshi sculptures act as architectural brackets, supporting the sandstone beams that ran above their heads. The yakshi is the almost nude female figure clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with a leg along its trunk. They wear jewelry around their necks, waists, and ankles.</p>
<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa- Circumambulating path to Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/92.-Stupa-Plan.jpg?resize=466%2C702&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="466" height="702" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Circumambulating</strong> is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong> (also known as the dharma and the law). By turning around, they understand what means to be caught up in samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death. Escaping on the 2nd terrace allows them to understand the escape from the cycle, the <strong>Enlightenment.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stupa= a circle or wheel and the unmoving center symbolizes Enlightenment.</li>
<li>stupas are placed on a square base, and the four sides represent the four directions, north, south, east and west.</li>
<li>Each side often has a gate—torana— in the center, which allows the practitioner to enter</li>
<li>Each gate is a life event of the Buddha: East (Buddha’s birth), South (Enlightenment), West (First Sermon where he preached his teachings or dharma), and North (Nirvana).</li>
<li>The gates are turned at right angles to the axis mundi to indicate movement in the manner of the arms of a svastika, a directional symbol that, in Sanskrit, means “to be good”</li>
<li>They are guarded by guardians to remind the passage from mundane to sacred. They are either nude or dressed with a local dhoti</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa Aniconic representations of Buddha</strong></h5>
<p>Sculptural friezes at important early Buddhist stupas like Sanchi depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the <strong>Buddha represented in aniconic form</strong>, using certain fixed symbols. On the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi the <strong>Buddha’s body is represented by the Body tree, a crowning lotus rosette </strong>on a column like structure, <strong>a stupa</strong>, the <strong>Buddha’s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).</strong></p>
<p>Each symbol <strong>represents a pivotal event in Buddha’s life:</strong> a lotus (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, a fig tree or throne representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, a wheel, a flaming column with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and a stupa (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.  In some cases, he is also represented by a pair of footprints.</p>
<h5><strong>Stupa -Jataki Monkey King story &#8211; Bodhisattva</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A depiction of the Mahakapi Jataka</strong> appears on the western gateway of the Great Stupa (Stupa 1) at Sanchi.  <strong>The first scene, depicted at the bottom, shows the arrival of the king of Benaras</strong>, mounted on a horse accompanied by soldiers. The king is shown with a parasol or chatra over his head, which signifies his royal status.</p>
<p>A feature that arouses curiosity is the portrayal of <strong>musicians who accompany the king</strong>—perhaps meant to accentuate the royal status of the king, suggesting that he travels with an entourage of attendants and musical accompaniment. <strong>To the right</strong> of the king an archer appears with bow and arrow aiming at the Bodhisattva <strong>(Great Monkey)</strong>.</p>
<p>The artist(s) of the Sanchi relief shows the Bodhisattva as the bridge by which monkeys escape the king’s arrows to join the rest of the troop in the forest. <strong>On the left side of the river</strong> (which in this relief is full of active fish and rhythmic waves of water), two men, presumably following the order of the king, appear holding a sheet below the Great Monkey as he falls.</p>
<p>The episodes depicted in the Sanchi panel <strong>give no indication of order</strong> through either time or cause and effect. Such is the complexity of this portrayal that even a viewer well-versed in this story must closely examine the panel to “read” it accurately. Apparently, the artist made this for an audience with previous knowledge of the Jataka stories. There is mention of Bodhisattva instructing the king in Buddhist law before dying from the sustained wounds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Stupas predate Buddhism</strong>. Before Buddha, teachers and philosophers were buried in stupas (Hindu funerary monuments). The shape was supposed to represent a person seated in meditation.</p>
<p>In the 6th century BCE stupas built after Buddhism contained portions of the Buddha’s ashes (not known exactly when Buddha died for sure). There were 8 stupas originally because there were 8 kings who wanted to split the remains.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century BCE Great Stupa was one of the oldest and best-preserved stupas from Ashoka’s reign. Ashoka was the greatest Mauryan king in India and the first ruler to associate with Buddhism in India. He converted after killing 100,000 people. When he converted, he disinterred Buddha’s remains from the other stupas and distributed the remains to his new stupas.</p>
<p>Ashoka built many stupas across his empire so the faithful could always access them. Ashoka chose this site because it was raised on a hill</p>
<p>In the 2nd century BCE, the Sunga Dynasty in India enlarged this stupa and decorated it by adding the gates.</p>

<p><strong>Funeral banner of Lady Dai </strong>is an artwork of<strong> painted silk </strong>that measure<strong> 6 feet by 7 inches long. This is an </strong>early example of painted naturalistic scenes in Chinese art.</p>
<p>During this time, we begin to see some of the Chinese 2D characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy black calligraphic line</li>
<li>use of red and black</li>
<li>stylized figures</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the earliest known Chinese portrait. Painted silk was a common and expensive artform in China.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was <strong>a sign of status</strong>, as painted silk was an expensive artform.</p>
<p>It was used to <strong>attract the spirit of the deceased</strong> to its tomb, where it could be properly started on its afterlife journey&#8211; instead of remaining on earth to bother the living. (This is like Tut’s tomb)</p>
<p>It was <strong>part of the funeral procession</strong> and was carried in front, before being draped upon her coffin.</p>
<p><strong>Here is What We See </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical divisions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Left: yin (female component = moon)</li>
<li>Center: yin + yang</li>
<li>Right: yang (male component = sun)</li>

<li><strong>Horizontal divisions</strong>

<li>Heaven
<ul>
<li>Dragons, toads, moon, crow on red sun</li>
<li>At the very top, a twisted red dragon, is an imperial ancestor (to show her noble lineage)</li>
<li>At the bottom of the cross of the T are two kneeling guides who will shepherd her to the afterlife</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earth (where Lady Dai and her attendants are)</strong>
<ul>
<li>She carries her long cane (which was found in her tomb; she had sciatica – leg pain from pressure on nerves in lower back)</li>
<li>Accompanied by mourner-attendants who bid her farewell</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underworld (body of Lady Dai and her mourners; underworld is not equivalent to Hell)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Below her, and with dragons wrapped through it, is a <strong>bi</strong> (pronounced “bee”; round circular disc with a hole in the middle; symbol of heaven)</li>
<li>Sacrificial funerary rituals take place</li>
<li>Vessels for food and wine while corpse is wrapped in robe</li>
<li>Shows her journey to Heaven</li>
<li>Long dragons frame the scene – symbol of the supernatural</li>
<li>She is wearing her own funeral banner over her shoulders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Market for Art</strong></h5>
<p>During the <strong>Han Dynasty</strong> the Silk Road trade was incredibly popular and wealthy individuals in China invested in art.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Lady Dai?</strong></h5>
<p>She was the wife of Marquis of Dai, a high-ranking civil servant. The lady died around the age of 50. Lady Dai lived in Han Dynasty which was the Golden Age of Classical China with a highly stratified society.</p>
<p>Only elites could afford elaborate rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>The Find</strong></h5>
<p>The tombs of Marquis of Dai, Lady Dai and her son were all discovered in 1971. Lady Dai was put to rest in seven nested lacquer coffins.  Her body was found wrapped in 20 layers of silk. The airtight tomb was 36 feet underground in a clay lined and charcoal packed hole. (Charcoal absorbs moisture)</p>
<p>All the above led to a very well-preserved body. Her skin was still elastic, joints flexible, she had eyelashes and nostril hair. Blood remained in her veins, and all organs were intact.</p>
<p>She died of a heart attack. There were 138 melon seeds in her body which suggests she died shortly after eating the fruit.</p>

<p><strong><em>Todai-ji</em></strong> in <strong>Nara, Japan</strong> was created by various artists, including <strong>sculptors Unkei and Keikei</strong>, as well as the <strong>Kei School</strong>. Material includes <strong>bronze and wood (sculpture)</strong> as well as <strong>wood with ceramic-tile roofing (architecture).</strong></p>
<p>In the 8<sup>th</sup> century, this was the largest building project on Japanese soil ever. The construction was modeled after Chinese Tang architecture and <strong>sinification</strong>. It was based on the pagoda style and multi-eaved buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Elaborate bracketing systems</strong> were used such as complex wooden joints instead of nails to hold the building together. Large sturdy pillars helped to funnel weight to the ground.</p>
<p>Cypress wood is the main building material. The Japanese have always had a close link to the natural environment and history of wood craftsmanship. An enormous amount of the material was required.  Cypress was the main wood used. It grows up to 40 meters, is naturally straight, has tight grain that easily splits into long beams and is resistant to rot.</p>
<p>The main Buddha Hall used 2200 acres of local forest and it had 84 massive pillars. The wood had to be brought from many miles away and came from ten different provinces.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Place of worship for Buddhists and place of learning for Buddhist students</li>
<li>Displayed Emperor Shomu’s power, piety, and prestige</li>
<li>To unite Japanese clans under his rule, he promoted spiritual unity across the land that he was the leader of</li>
<li>Todai-ji was to be the chief temple of Buddhism in Japan</li>
</ul>
<p>During the rebuilding the Minamoto family was eager to present itself as national saviors who were pious. They wanted to seem morally superior to the Taira clan. Thus, political propaganda during each of its building phases.</p>

<p>Todai-ji is also known as “Eastern Temple”</p>

<p><strong>Nios</strong> are aggressive guardian deities of Buddhism that were originally a Hindu idea. They justify the force by eliminating evil.</p>
<p><strong>Nios </strong>are the Japanese version of <strong>vajrapani </strong>and are usually used as guardians at the gates of Buddhist temples. They are a metaphor for shoguns who will defend their Buddhist faith</p>

<p>The large-scale rebuilding in the 12<sup>th</sup> century created a multitude of commissions for buildings and sculptors. To fulfill demands, the Kei School of Sculpture emerged. This was the peak of Japanese sculpture.  The work was noted for the muscularity and dynamism of its figures. Sculptors such as Unkei and Keikei became famous.</p>
<p>The Nios are 26 feet tall, with powerful and dynamic bodies, in dramatic contrapposto.  They have bulging muscles and popping veins. The hair is pulled tightly back, and a sense of movement is created.  Originally, they were covered in black lacquer.</p>
<p>Documents were found inside the wood bodies about the patronage. <strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Great Buddha </strong>was originally created between 743 – 752 CE. It would have been complete in 749, but the snail-curl hair took and additional 3 years. At over 49 feet tall, it is Japan’s largest statue. It represents Vairocona Buddha the Buddha of wisdom and therefore must be larger than life.</p>
<p>The work was Commissioned by Emperor Shomu, and it required all the available copper in Japan. This was then mixed with tin to create bronze.</p>
<p>When completed, the Japanese court, officials and Buddhist dignitaries from China and India attended an “eye-opening” ceremony. An Indian monk painted in the Buddha’s eyes, symbolically imbuing it with life.</p>
<p><strong>Daibutsu</strong> is Japanese for Giant Buddha.</p>
<h5><strong>Buddhism in Japan</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6<sup>th</sup> century via Silk Road traders.</p>
<p>It quickly became associated with the Imperial Court and the elite showed status this way.</p>
<p>During the 8<sup>th</sup> century Emperor Shomu promoted Buddhism across the state and built Todai-ji for the Kegon sect of Buddhism (earliest form of Japanese Buddhism). This was part of a large building project where he ordered temples, monasteries, and convents to be built throughout Japan’s 66 provinces.</p>
<p>In the 12<sup>th</sup> century, during the rebuild, there was the Gempei Civil War between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto clan won as the Buddhists from Todai-ji had allied with them.</p>
<p>Taira clan burned the site in 1180 as retaliation. The destruction shocked Japan.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rebuild</strong></h5>
<p>The Minamoto elite contributed funds to rebuilding it and then looked like benefactors.</p>
<p>The Buddhist priest Chogen was placed in charge of reconstruction. He made three trips to China to observe what Song China was doing artistically.</p>
<p>In 1700 Buddha was redone.</p>

<p><strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> in <strong>Khajuraho, India</strong>, is built from <strong>sandstone</strong> and stands <strong>85 feet high.</strong>  It is one of the ancient Hindu shrines of India. Located inside the native of Khajurao, in central India, they are famous for their incredibly beautiful erotic sculptures, displaying several sex positions in the most sensual form. One of the finest specimens of temple architecture, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is made in a <strong>Nagara style architecture of northern India.</strong></p>
<p>Despite many foreign invasions, the temple has survived the wrath of time. The well-carved columns, plinth, walls, sanctum, and halls are worth noticing. They are living proof of <strong>semantic Indian art</strong> and expert <strong>craftsmanship of Indian artists</strong>.</p>

<p>Males and females locked in sexual positions portray the deep knowledge that ancient Indian sages had regarding lovemaking as a concept of attaining spiritual bliss. Moreover, artists have sculpted human figures with accurate anatomy, denoting the system of research prevalent among the guilds. Owing to the temple being extant, the architecture and stone masonry are exceptional.</p>
<p>In the past, Indian art is an embodiment of abstract and manifest. The manifest forms through temple architecture represent life and its eventual surrender to the higher consciousness by refining the senses.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is a part of a bigger complex with many other shrines in Khajurao, a native village in central India. When it was built in the 10th century AD, more than 80 temples were constructed. These were destroyed by Sultanate rulers, post-12-13th centuries. Presently, less than 25 temples are extant, remembering the ancient artistic legacy.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2034" style="width: 821px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2034" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?resize=821%2C550&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="821" height="550" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2034" class="wp-caption-text">Detail © Michele Burgess/Alamy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Built on the raised platform, plinth or <em>jagati</em>, the central shrine of <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is surrounded by four smaller shrines, constructed in the same style. This pattern is known as Panchayantana in Indian doctrines. Notably, this structure reminds us of four minarets surrounding the famous mausoleum, Taj Mahal by Shah Jahan. The function served is quite contradictory in the case of this Hindu temple. As it is a Nagara-style temple, it comprises the main space called <em>garbha griha</em> or sanctum, which houses the god-statue of <strong>Lord Vaikunth Vishnu</strong>. It is a small, windowless, and no-contact, sacred space, where most priests are allowed to perform routine rituals.</p>
<p>Vishnu is one of the main gods of the Hindu pantheon, which <strong>symbolizes preservation and protection</strong>. The cult of Vishnu in India is known as Vaishnavite. Mentioned in the Vedas, he is a Vedic god and thus had a large following throughout the continent of India since the ancient past. Most importantly, Vishnu is the god who regularly incarnates on the earth whenever there arises a great force of evil.</p>
<p>Vishnu appeared on the earth through ten reincarnations which consist of popular gods like Rama, Krishna, Parshurama, among six others. In addition, Vishnu also appears in a variety of other divine forms, among which Vaikunth Vishnu is also a significant one. The god with three heads and four hands, is a powerful emblem of taking charge of the preservation of life and beings. The three heads represent three combined incarnations viz. Narsimha, Varaha and Saumya.</p>
<p>Facing east, the <strong>garbha griha</strong> is enclosed in a tall spire structure called <strong>vimana.</strong> Tapering at the top, the <strong>vimana </strong>symbolizes refinement of human senses to achieve supreme bliss and union with God. The sanctum connects to an alley called <strong>antarala</strong>, which is a connecting bridge to the sacred space with a secular one.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>The sacred space of <strong>garbha griha</strong> opens to a hall with many decorative columns, in hypostyle format, which is called <strong>mandapa</strong>.</p>
<p>There are categories to <strong>mandapa,</strong> which comprise <strong>ardhamandapa</strong> and <strong>sabhamandapa</strong>,<em> </em>concerning the performed activities. These activities include religious duties, chanting, singing hymns in the praise of gods and goddesses, among others. <strong>Mandapa</strong><em> </em>is a secular space, where every layman is allowed to visit and pray.</p>
<p>The interior of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is made with corbeled arch, a style of overlapping masonry, which is pressured on the ground for stability. This is known as <strong>Ashlar masonry</strong> with stones fitted using rivets instead of mortar or nails. Artists have used <strong>horror vacui</strong>, defining the profuse decoration on the outside walls. Significantly, the southern walls of the temple show intimate sexual poses of a male-female union.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2035" style="width: 836px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2035" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-D.png?resize=836%2C564&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="836" height="564" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2035" class="wp-caption-text">Lakshmana Temple plan</figcaption></figure>
<p>The temple sculpture in ancient India followed the aesthetics of <strong>rasa</strong> (acquiring relish) and <strong>Taalmana</strong><em> </em>(proportion) to create evocative artworks. Hence, the figures are curvy, tall, slender, and extremely rhythmic. Moreover, they are lyrical, moving the gaze subtly and effectively. Artists were able to achieve this remarkable feat of precision because of <strong>sandstone, which is soft and workable</strong>.</p>
<p>Apart from erotic couples called <strong>mithuna,</strong> there are high reliefs of over 600 gods from Hindu pantheons. The short capitals show the form of lions, while before a devotee circumambulates the temple, the statue of Lord Ganesha assures of the correct revolving path. Significantly, in India, Lord Ganesha is worshipped by all creeds before initiating a new chapter of life. The human figurines are adorned with many accessories denoting royalness.</p>
<p>The interior of the Lakshmana Temple is equally decorated with the narration of the lives of gods. Incarnations of Vishnu, Krishna Leela (tale), among many other narrative panels enliven the temple with the traditional culture of India. Based on Indian aesthetic theories, the placement of sculptures allots figures of speech (<em>alamkara</em>) quality. Hence, they suggest an abstract philosophy over describing it through inscriptions. The aesthetics of suggestions in Indian aesthetic theory is called <em>dhvani</em>. Through love-making scenes on the temple, the importance of sex as a means to higher consciousness is emphasized by the ruling dynasty of Chandella.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Primarily, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple serves as the worshipping place of Lord Vishnu</strong>. The Hindu temples are deemed as a residing space for the god among the common masses. Visiting the temple, the devotee circumambulates the shrine to activate the divine energy and pay symbolic reverence and dedication. Most importantly, they should circumambulate in a clockwise direction.</p>
<p>The Chandella kingdom followed the Vaishnaivite cult and to address social legitimacy, they built many temples. It also showed their piety. With respect to political agenda, they would often borrow the model of deity from the neighboring kingdom to maintain the cordial relation. In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple,</strong> king Yashovarman had followed the same method. However, it is stated that the present idol in the temple is not an original one.</p>
<p>Rulers are depicted in tantric sex poses, which were seen as a kind of offering to the deities. The theme of the building is preservation (this is what Vishnu embodies): whether it be sexual prolonging or preservation of human life (through reproduction).</p>
<p>The ancient Indian temples are solid proof of profound study, which are documented in the doctrines called <strong>shastras.</strong> From the studies in the science of construction to the study of making love is practically demonstrated and celebrated in these documents.</p>
<p>With respect to the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, the legacy of architecture and art is combined with tantric philosophy, which presents a spiritual significance to sex. According to Tantrism, the union of the male and female body develops proximity with god.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Shilpashashtra and Kamasutra are ancient Indian texts on the art of sculpting and lovemaking, respectively. The main architect of the temple is known as Sutradhar or a Vishwakarma, a person who designs and directs the construction. Indian traditional doctrines are also replete with information to plan the building, as well as instructions to create a sculpture concerning the essential aesthetics. These structures of information have proven to be textbooks to the generation of artists in making high-relief or free-standing sculptures. Majorly, the narratives have been borrowed from ancient texts like Vedas, Puranas, and epics.</p>
<p>Presenting a Vaikunth Vishnu idol in the sanctum, the Chandela kings propagated Vaisnavism. However, they also promoted Jainism and had also supported the construction of Jain temples.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>Yashvoraman, a Chandella king, in 930 AD, augmented the construction of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, which eventually was completed during his son’s rule. A guild of artists was employed to finish the massive plan of the temple. Concerning the ruler’s desire to stand it out from the rest, a few changes were observed.</p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, the notion of sculpting erotic poses on the junctures was novel and performed for the first time. It is an example of using one of the figures of speech (<em>alamkara</em>) called <em>slesha </em>or pun. The temple was and is open to the visitors to seek the blessings of the preserver deity, Vishnu. It is one of the world heritage sites of India.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>Lakshmana temple was constructed between 930 &#8211; 1050 CE. Yashovarman of the Chandella dynasty built many temples in Khajurao with an exemplary amount of exterior as well as interior decoration. Thus, it initiated the nomenclature of Chandela art and architecture with specific significance. Moreover, Khajurao was the capital of the kingdom that boasts many cultural sites.</p>
<p>During the 10th century AD, the history of India had witnessed many falls and the rise of successful empires. Thus, the heritage was becoming predominant had followed a set of established rules. Many other kingdoms prevailed with final successive rules of Pala kingdom in the east and Chola kingdom in the south, among others, who proved great patronage to art and architecture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Travelers Among Mountains and Streams</em></strong>, by artist <strong>Fan Kuan</strong> is a work comprised of <strong>ink and color on silk</strong>. It measures <strong>7 feet by 3 feet and 4 inches</strong>.</p>
<p>This work has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisp brushwork</li>
<li>Painting on silk</li>
<li>Height is emphasized by filling up the composition</li>
</ul>
<p>There are gaps between the foreground, middleground, and background. This suggests space in between. Negative space implies space is moving backwards and receding.</p>
<p>Scrolls were selected by artists based on color and texture and usually have the title up on the top right.</p>
<p><strong>Style Features</strong></p>
<p>There are<strong> six components</strong> that Fan Kuan was taught by his master, as were many <strong>literati.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>What was the Function of a Scroll?</strong></h5>
<p>Scrolls were expensive, a <strong>sign of status</strong>, and something you would display to your guests. These artworks were not permanently displayed. They were meant to be admired and studied but carefully packed away.</p>
<p>One can study the image, meditate upon it and generally slow down. This provokes the same response as gazing at a beautiful vista would.</p>
<p>There is immensity of nature. Man is dwarfed by nature. There is also beauty in nature. Men can get lost in nature and revel at its immensity.</p>
<h5><strong>A Display of Daoist Attitude</strong></h5>
<p>Scrolls could also display the <strong>Daoist </strong>attitude of <strong>Yin and Yang</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daoism was popular amongst the elite</li>
<li><strong>Yin:</strong> female; dark; receptive; yielding; weak</li>
<li><strong>Yang:</strong> male; light; assertive; creative; strong</li>
<li>The interaction of these complementary ideas is necessary to natural order</li>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>During the chaos of the Five Kingdoms period (between the Tang and Song dynasties), many scholars and artists fled to the mountains. Known as <strong>literati</strong> these people were disenchanted with human affairs and turned towards nature.</p>
<p>Scenes that depicted majestic landscapes developed into an ironically popular style in urban China. China elevated landscape paintings to an important subject for art, hundreds of years before Western artists would.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fan Kuan</strong>, was an artist and a Daoist hermit, whom very little is known about. He is famous for landscapes in the Song period, and this is possibly his only surviving work.</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>Shiva as Lord of Dance</strong></em><em> </em>or the famous <em><strong>Natraja</strong></em><em> </em>sculpture epitomizes the manifestation of divine and cosmic energy. It is an absolute artistic representation of the <strong>golden age of sculpture in India</strong> and made from <strong>bronze</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p>The viewer must train the eye to look beyond the mere dancing pose and try and grasp the deeper meanings of symbolic gestures and forms. Although <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> is shown in an effeminate dancing pose, it is a <strong>symbiotic form of male and female energy</strong>. With one leg lifted, knee bent, and a hand crossing over the chest, the lyrical composition brings attention to the cosmic rhythm of the universe.</p>
<p>Etymologically, in Nataraja, <em>nat </em>means dance, and <em>raja </em>denotes the king. <strong><em>Narteswar</em></strong> and <strong><em>Natesa</em></strong> are two other names attributed to this sculpture.</p>
<p>As one of the Hindu pantheon’s top three gods, <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> is mentioned as a destroyer of the world, wherein he serves as an agent to initiate the process of new creation. That is why he is <strong>one of the most revered gods in India</strong>. Presenting primordial rhythm and sound, Natraja or Shiva as Lord of Dance amplifies two critical events of universal life: <strong>birth and death</strong>. As he performs the dance called <strong>Tandava,</strong> he is annihilating the present world with utmost calm composure.</p>
<p>As the most popular Indian sculpture, an emblem of worship and religiosity, <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> <strong>symbolizes fearlessness, the defeat of evil, peace, wisdom, and immense knowledge</strong>. A cultural motif, different regions and timelines have depicted the Natraja in various styles, each showing a different number of hands of Shiva.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visual Elements</strong></h5>
<p>Each motif or the form in the Natraja is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.</p>
<p>The arch surrounding the Shiva shows flames that originate from the mouth of the creature called <strong>Makara</strong>, a mythical sea creature, at the base. Thus, the encircling <strong>nimbus represents</strong> a cosmic circle of fire. This denotes the never-ending cycle of creation and destruction—a cogent Hindu belief. This nimbus or halo is known as the <em>Prabha mandala</em>. Interestingly, the earlier Natraja idols had an arch while later transformed into a fully circular halo. As he is ecstatically dancing, the flying locks of Shiva fan around, touching the nimbus.</p>
<p>The <strong>headdress</strong> consists of a skull, and a flower named Datura metel, denoting death as the ultimate truth and fragrance of life, respectively. Mounted with a crescent moon and the goddess <strong>Ganga</strong>, it indicates a peaceful state of mind despite the impending termination of life that everyone is destined to.</p>
<p>According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was brought to earth from heaven by Shiva, to save the world from drought. It is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.</p>
<p><strong>Shiva has four hands</strong>, which either carry some symbolic object or depict a hand pose called <em><strong>mudra</strong></em><em>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upper right hand</strong> holds a drum, called <em><strong>Damaru</strong></em><u>,</u>which continues beating over time. Like a ticking clock, it symbolizes the primordial sound of regular and many creations and annihilations.</li>
<li>The <strong>lower right-hand</strong> palm is raised, known as <em><strong>abhaya </strong></em>mudra, signifying fearlessness towards evil. The same hand has a cobra wrapped around the wrist, designating fear, danger, and turmoil. Yet, the lord is unperturbed.</li>
<li>The <strong>upper left-hand</strong> holds <strong>agni</strong> (fire), an important element for the act of creation as well as destruction.</li>
<li>Crossing his chest, the <strong>lower left-hand</strong> hides the heart of the Shiva. It is known as <em><strong>tirodhaana</strong></em>, meaning concealment. The same hand points to the left foot.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva possesses three eyes</strong>. Inclusive of the third eye on the forehead, is an inner eye that opens a vast pool of inherent knowledge and wisdom. Adorned with accessories like a bracelet and necklace, the loincloth also blows with the vigorous movement of dance, touching the halo. Shiva stands one-footed on the dwarf demon names Apasmara Purusha, which exemplifies ignorance and illusion.</p>
<p>Most importantly, throughout all of this, Shiva continues to remain patient and peaceful, projecting the idea of control or <em><strong>sayyam</strong></em><em> </em>in the act. Hence, the sculpture is an eye opener in the chaotic world, where we tend to forget the higher purpose of life, while following a dogmatic routine.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> is a cult statue dedicated to Lord Shiva, a prominent Hindu god. One of the oldest religions of India, Hinduism had been a pivotal belief in addressing the meanings of icons used in art forms. The doctrine Shilpashastra is the most important in ancient Indian literature that compulsively dominates the form, style, and composition of early Indian sculpture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> condenses the ancient iconography of India, embodying the divine. It was created to anesthetize the laws of the universe into a narrative that can relate as well as connect to the common mass. It emulates the dancing form from the doctrine called Natyashastra, a book of theatre. Thus, it was a cult statue throughout the sub-religions of India.</p>
<p>The sculpture of Shiva was first made <strong>in a dancing pose</strong> for temples during the 5th and 6th century CE as relief sculptures. The free-standing sculpture began to be made in the 10th century and <strong>preferably in bronze</strong>.</p>
<p>Around the 11th century, Nataraja statues were carried in processional parades, comprising priests and devotees. As a concept of commemoration, the Natraja idols would be <strong>covered with red and green cloth, surrounded by candles and flowers</strong>. The presence of the god in the statue, or deifying the idol, comes into being when a devotee worships it with immense faith.</p>
<p>Indian art was based on the fundamental principles of art and aimed at evoking the inherent emotion <strong>(bhava)</strong> of the art piece into the audience called <strong>rasa</strong>. The experience of expected <strong>rasa</strong> in the viewers is the marker of the successful artwork. Hence, developing an enormous reverence to the holy process of annihilation, which will inevitably become the ground of creation, Natraja follows this indoctrinated philosophy of art sincerely.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Composed in a balanced format, this bronze sculpture is from the Chola dynasty of the 10th century. The Chola artist employed the <strong>lost wax process</strong> or Cire perdue technique of casting. Hence<strong><em>, Natraja</em></strong> is also created with the same process. The cire perdue entails a long process of forming a wax model to prepare a core around it and pouring the molten metal either to produce a hollow or a solid cast.</p>
<p>During the Chola period, bronze casting was in vogue, which is proved by a range of artifacts of a variety of Indian gods available in diverse collections. Significantly, these sculptures project stone temple carvings&#8217; style along with the iconographical features, which purports a commendable merger of technique and aesthetics. With the instruction from Shilpashastra, the <em>talman </em>or the proportion for the divine figures was preordained. The doctrine also commands how limbs should be styled, underlining Hindu ideology.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>The Chola dynasty served as a patron to <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> or <strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance</em></strong>. Proliferating in trade and development, the Chola regions observed notable advancement in bronze casting. Moreover, the expanse of the empire extended until Srilanka in the south and other southeast Asian countries. Hence, they had enormous access to vast copper reserves, which multiplied the production of bronze sculptures.</p>

<p>The focus of the drawing and writing in the <strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> is on the battle scene. This emphasizes its <strong>violence, the skills of the samurai</strong>, as well as the <strong>luxury of the emperor and of his consorts. </strong></p>
<p>The text usually precedes the illustration, but in this case, it frames it. The scroll’s inscription summarizes the events. “It was more than horrible.”</p>
<h5><strong>The Ongoing Battle of the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>The artist removes the roof of the palace and places himself at an elevated “bird’s eye” observation point.  Here, he describes every scene in detail. This technique was largely used in <strong>yamato-e paintings</strong> and creates a feeling of peeking indiscreetly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> uses a continuous narration technique. <strong>The action moves from right to left</strong> in panels that are unschooled by the narrator.</p>
<p>A single ox carriage transports your eye in the whirlwind of carts and mounted warriors. The wheels of the cart are spinning, and people are trapped.</p>
<p>A few characters appear more than once. Note the courtier Fushiwara and the mounted Minamoto Yoshitomo with his samurai horned helmet tied with a chin strap. The main characters are seen pushing the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa in the carriage.</p>
<p>This work <strong>combines poems with drawings.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The artist uses a differentiated portraiture technique for the samurai heroes emphasizing their emotions and ruthlessness. Meanwhile the courtiers, and court ladies were depicted fugitively with stylized aristocratic dignified faces, lacking personality.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>Going from right to left, the hand scroll offered a cinema experience. Your eye draws imaginary diagonal lines, while following the ox cart carrying away the captured retired emperor. The use of diagonal lines emphasizes movement and disentangles the viewer from the mass of the samurai killing courtiers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The storytelling exhibits symmetry and relies on a crescendo to capture the viewer’s attention. It starts with a nicely decorated single ox carriage. Following the carriage, the viewer gets entangled among colliding carts and warriors.</p>
<p>The violence escalates. It culminates as the palace is engulfed by flames. Courtiers have their necks cut. Court ladies in heavy silk dresses are ambushed by arrows and chose to commit suicide by jumping in the wells.</p>
<p>After kidnapping the retired emperor, the samurai flew on their horses leaving behind a disaster.  In the end a running archer followed by a samurai led the rebels far away from the palace engulfed by flames. The samurai break free. They seem to draw energy from the violence they created.</p>
<p>Without any remorse for the wreckage, the painting celebrates the samurai’s swift and fatal power. It is the Minamoto clan (the victors) point of view.</p>
<p>The <strong>brushstrokes are refined</strong> while depicting the palace, the gateways, and people at the court. The <strong>brushstrokes become brisk</strong> for the horses and the samurai.</p>
<p>The dramatic moment of <strong>the battle is captured using vivid red and green colors</strong>. The <strong>use of black</strong> for the palace focuses the viewer on its veranda event in which the emperor is forced to enter the cart.</p>
<p>The painting is <strong>intended to be realistic</strong>. The attention to detail makes it a <strong>valuable historical reference</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A handscroll tells a story</strong> section, by section as it is horizontally unrolled. <strong><em> Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> gives realistic details on the conflict between rival samurai clans.</p>
<p>It was made in the 13th century to commemorate a 12th century event, glorifying the clan Minamoto and the Samurai in general.</p>
<blockquote><p>The mounted armored archer and their war tactics seemed to illustrate the words of the Chinese tactician Sun Tzu (The Art of War): <em>In raiding and plundering be like fire…Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The facts in the painting happened in the end of the Heian period. The painting was commissioned in the Kamakura period (1185 -1333) and initiated by the Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo. During the Kamakura period the samurai were an established “knightly” class and Minamoto were the shogun’s clan.</p>
<p>The work also has documentary value on the Heiji Rebellion (1159-60). This detail-oriented painting provides precious information on the <strong>armor, head protection and weapons of the samurai</strong>, as well as <strong>the weaponry of other foot soldiers</strong>. Observe the historical references of the <strong>clothes of courtiers and court ladies.</strong> Also look at the <strong>architecture and decoration of royal gateways and buildings</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>hand scroll technique</strong> probably originated in India around 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE.</p>
<p>Around the 6th century CE., it arrived via the Silk Road all the way to Japan together with the Buddhist religious scrolls and the Chinese writing system. It took almost two centuries for Japanese Buddhists to produce their own scrolls.</p>
<p><strong>The Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</strong> is a narrative painting, called <strong>e-maki</strong>. It combines an illustrated hand scroll, with the sequential technique of the Buddhist scrolls, and the traditional Japanese painting, yamato-e, developed alongside poetry during the Heian period.</p>
<p><strong>Initially e-maki depicted literary classics</strong> such as <em>The Tale of Genji</em>. In the military ruled Kamakura era, illustrated handscrolls often had a focus on “war tales” like this one. The action-oriented paintings or the ones detailing historical events were preferred by men. They were called <strong>otoko‐e</strong>, or “men’s paintings”. An entire set was dedicated to the events of the Heiji rebellion. Another scroll tells the story of Taira recuperating the retired Emperor and one is only remnants.</p>
<p>The attack on the retired emperor was insignificant, but the painting is a masterpiece of Japanese painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>The audience of an emaki was reduced. It is an <strong>intimate object</strong> that was held in the hands of the narrator who presented the story scene by scene to a small group of listeners.</p>
<p>With their exquisite calligraphy and paintings, generally done by official court painters, the <em>emaki</em> appealed to an educated elite, such as the imperial family, the shogun, or Buddhist monks.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>The scene takes place during the Heiji Rebellion at the end of the Heian period. This was known as <strong>the period of calm and tranquility.</strong> This is considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court. At the end of this era the sovereignty laid with the emperor, but in fact the power was wielded by the noble clans.</p>
<p>The Fujiwara and afterwards the Taira clan controlled the imperial court by marrying their daughters with the emperor and relegating the emperors to endless ceremonial functions. Japanese emperors reclaimed their power by abdicating in favor of a successor and relegating that one to conduct the ceremonies. Disputes ensued each time that the successor to the throne was chosen or an emperor retired.</p>
<p>By participating in all these disputes, <strong>the samurai warrior class steadily rose and made political gains</strong> throughout the entire Heian period.</p>
<p>In 1159, during the Heiji Rebellion the courtier Fujiwara no Nobuyori seemed the help of the samurai Minamoto no Yoshitomo to attack the palace. They started a fire and mercilessly killed courtiers and court ladies, in a bid to seize both the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa and his son from the power grip of the rival samurai clan, Taira.</p>
<p>Minamoto tried to control the emperor. Another scroll continues the story by telling how the Taira managed to regain control of the Emperor. The continued rivalry between Minamoto and Taira led to the civil Genpei War, the destruction of the Taira and the establishment of the Minamoto Shogunate.</p>

<p><strong><em>Forbidden City</em></strong> located in<strong> Beijing, China </strong>is a stunning Chinese Palace made of<strong> stone masonry, marble, brick, wood, and ceramic tile. </strong>It sits in the center of the city<strong> on 178 acres.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the building is <strong>timber and brick</strong>, with sloping rooflines and <strong>glazed roof tiles. </strong>The emphasis is on traditional craftsmanship through the support of Chinese laborers. Tile roofs curve upward to allow light in and keep rain out.</p>
<h5><strong>The Significance of Numbers</strong></h5>
<p>Extensive use of <strong>the number 3</strong> and multiples of 3 are used throughout. There are <strong>three tiered roofs</strong>, and the <strong>staircases have 9 steps.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 3</strong> is associated with harmony between yin and yang</li>
<li><strong>Number 9</strong> is associated with divinity of emperor</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Meaning of Color</strong></h5>
<p>The use of color in the<strong> <em>Forbidden City</em> </strong>also has meaning. These are the four main colors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red</strong> represents the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> represents the earth.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong> represents the Heavens.</li>
<li><strong>White</strong> is a symbol of purity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>courtyard style residence</strong> uses a <strong>geometric organization</strong> of space that is aligned with the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>Outer court represented <strong>Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the South.</li>
<li>Belonged to realm of state affairs and only men had access to its spaces.</li>
<li>Included: emperor’s formal reception halls, places for religious rituals and state ceremonies.</li>
<li>Hall of Supreme Harmony represented central focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inner court represented <strong>Heaven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the North</li>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>Eastern and Western sides reserved for retired emperor and empress dowager</li>
<li>Also included <strong>Buddhist and Daoist temples</strong> building during Ming Dynasty</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>The symbolism shows the relationship between Heaven and Earth. Emperor is the Son of Heaven and can mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>Power is conveyed visually and there is a spatial representation of power. This shows the emperor’s power over laws and regulations since he can regulate and reorganize nature.</p>
<p>The architects followed ideal cosmic order and social hierarchy in Confucianism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The complex was to showcase Yongle’s magnificence during turbulent years after the overthrow of his nephew. It was a visual assertion of imperial power with ceremonial space, ritual space and living space.</p>
<p>It was named the <strong><em>Forbidden Palace</em></strong> because only royal court could enter.</p>
<p>The complex was a political and ritual center for China for 500+ years. It was a place of power and propaganda that legitimized rulers and became visual evidence for the Mandate of Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 North Gate (Gate of Divine Might)</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some key points about the <strong>North Gate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walls are 30 feet high to keep people out</li>
<li>Designed to withstand cannons</li>
<li>Gate from which troops would often leave</li>
<li>3 openings: middle one was reserved for the emperor only</li>
<li>Heavily guarded day and night</li>
</ul>

<p>This gate has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five entryways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest in the center was used as passage for Ming and Qing emperors.</li>
<li>The side ones are smaller and were used for officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-eaved roof is guarded by two pairs of <strong>Ming stone lions.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Mao Zedong</strong></h5>
<p>Today the gate is characterized by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong weighing 1.5 tons. Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two placards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: Long Live the People’s Republic of China</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrases have significant meaning as <strong>“Long Live”</strong> was reserved for Emperors of China. But afterward it was available to common people because Mao had liberated it…just like Forbidden City!</p>

<p><strong>The Northeastern section </strong>was a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. He planned to retire and abdicate, then settle down in modest quarters here, along with his major art collection.</p>
<p>This part of the complex is called the <strong>Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service</strong> and this room is the theater room. The layout mirrors the arrangement of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The finest craftsmen of the day spent <strong>five years building</strong> just this palace. He never spent a night here.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the palace was chained shut and largely forgotten. It has now been restored to what was imagined it would have been like.</p>
<p>If he didn’t sleep here, what did he do here?</p>
<p>There were <strong>gardens, banquet rooms, prayer halls</strong>, an <strong>opera house,</strong> and a <strong>theater room</strong>. It was a place to <strong>meditate, write poetry</strong>, and <strong>enjoy company of concubines.</strong></p>
<p>It was a simple rectangular room with translucent <strong>embroidered scenes</strong>, <strong>jade-inlaid wall hangings</strong> and <strong>Chinese carved decoration. </strong>There were also panoramic <strong>murals painted on silk</strong>, <strong>wisteria painted on ceilings</strong>, along with <strong>magpies flying over the tiled rooves</strong> of the palace. This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l’oeil</strong>). This was a testament to the emperor’s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.</p>
<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ming</strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant</strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.</p>
<p>The construction of the Forbidden city was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son’s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).</p>
<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.  The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China</p>

Interpretation of history</p>
<p><strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> was made by an<strong> unknown artist </strong>but<strong> based on an oil painting by Liu Chunhua. </strong>This<strong> color lithograph </strong>produced in the late 1960s<strong> measures 2 feet by 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>The work features a <strong>low horizon line</strong> to enlarge the figure and <strong>atmospheric perspective.</strong></p>
<p>It is painted with <strong>Western realism</strong> as it is <strong>modeled</strong>, in <strong>3D</strong>, has <strong>precision</strong>, and <strong>accuracy with form. </strong>There is realism of fabric, body, and landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Mao</strong> is idealized, luminous, lighter than the background so he stands out. When this painting was first made, he was in his 70s, but he appears much younger.</p>
<p>As for colors there is no use of traditional reds. Instead, <strong>purples, greens, browns are used</strong>. The symbolic colors were abandoned for realistic colors.</p>
<h5><strong>All About Color Lithographs</strong></h5>
<p>When an image is popular artists want to make prints of it for reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw image the with and oily crayon on a flat stone</li>
<li>Cover the stone with water. It is repelled from the oily crayon.</li>
<li>Cover the plate with oil-based ink. It is repelled from the places where the water was and latches onto the oily crayon.</li>
<li>Press the paper down on top. Apply pressure</li>
<li>To make a color lithograph, you would need multiple stones – one for each color.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended to be <strong>propaganda, emotionally moving </strong>and present an <strong>interpretation of history</strong>. It was made when Mao was not in a position of strength. He has found himself in this trouble because of the failure of the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>The point of this work was to help Mao regain power and mend the country. This was to convince others that Mao could lead the country again, like he had through the revolution, despite the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>The emphasize was on Mao’s grassroots beginnings and his inherent strength. It shows him as a revolutionary who was committed to championing the common people and doing what was right by addressing the lives of the working class.</p>
<p>This work was described by Communist party officials as a “model work”.</p>
<p>Mao looks the heroic, ennobled, aggrandized leader, who is honorable, successful, and determined.</p>
<p>The image was widely published in newspapers and journals, as well as reproduced in the form of posters, statues, and kitchenware. Some believe there were more than <strong>900 million copies</strong> made.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The strike hasn’t happened yet. He is brave because this is the dawn of a new day.</li>
<li>Heroic pose as he strides forward among lush fields.</li>
<li>The winds of change literally blow through the valley.</li>
<li>Chinese landscape now serves a new purpose – it shows the struggle of the common man and the beauty of China’s people.</li>
<li>Telephone pole in the distance associates Mao with technology.</li>
<li>Umbrella tucked beneath one arm, hand in a fist – he is superhuman, charismatic, determined, practical.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>In the early 1920s, Mao and other communists helped guide the 13,000 miners’ <strong>strike at the Anyuan Coal Mine</strong> to protest the treatment of workers and demand higher wages.</p>
<p>This resulted in higher wages, better conditions, an education program, and widespread support for the Communists. Mao emerged as one of the most significant and well-liked leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Mao ruled from 1949 – 1976.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Leap Forward (1958 – 1962) </strong>was Mao’s plan to industrialize China while maintaining the basic agricultural/pastoral structure of China. The “solution” was to have farmers create steel mills in their backyards. Millions died as not enough food was produced, steel mills caught fire and many other catastrophes. The plan backfires tremendously</p>
<p><strong>Mao’s Cultural Revolution of 1966</strong> continued for a few more years as a reaction to Mao realizing he was on the brink of losing power. Mao tried to turn frustration towards him into frustration towards the traditions of Chinese culture. Mao argued that his plan would have worked had it not been for Chinese traditions that stood in the way.</p>
<p>Mao mobilized peasants <strong>(Red Army)</strong> and together <strong>they tortured</strong> traditional artists, scholars, and professors, while they <strong>destroyed </strong>thousands of books, historical objects, and artworks (anything Confucian or Buddhist they could get their hands on).</p>
<p>Mao encouraged artists to create “art for the people” that would convey communist ideas in ways accessible to the masses. Realistic images of workers, soldiers, and peasants began to replace traditional ink/silk images of landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Liu Chunhua’s</strong> image was painted in 1969 in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. Liu Chunhua was a member of the Red Guard.</p>
<p>This work used socialist realism to portray Chairman Mao as a revolutionary leader committed to championing the common people.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1475" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=990%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.1 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia have long traditions of art making, reaching back into prehistoric times. The earliest known ceramic vessels were found in Asia. Fired shards from Yuchanyan Cave in China have been dated to 18,300 and 17,500 BCE.  Jomon vessels from Japan show shards dating back to 10,500 BCE. The arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia represent some of the world’s oldest, most diverse, and most sophisticated visual traditions.</p>
<h5><strong>Religion and Philosophy</strong></h5>
<p>Asian art was and is global. The cultures of these regions were connected to each other and to West Asia and Europe, with clear reciprocal influences. Here we will connect works of art and artistic traditions to the cultural practices and belief systems in South, East, and Southeast Asia. Many <strong>religious and philosophic traditions</strong> developed in these regions, and the art generated shows the strong influence.</p>
<h5><strong>A Wide Range of Media</strong></h5>
<p>The arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia include important forms developed in a wide range of media. <strong>Ceramic arts</strong> have flourished in Asia since the prehistoric era. Many technical and stylistic advancements such as the use of <strong>high-fire porcelain</strong>, developed here.</p>
<p><strong>Metal </strong>was used to create sculpture, arms and armor, ritual vessels, and decorative objects of all kinds.</p>
<p>Shang dynasty <strong>bronze vessels</strong> from China employed a unique <strong>piece-molding technique</strong> that has never been successfully replicated.</p>
<h5><strong>Distinctive Art Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Distinctive art forms from South, East, and Southeast Asia include the construction of <strong>Buddhist reliquary stupas</strong>. The practice of monochromatic ink painting on silk and paper, developed in China, as did the pagoda, an architectural form based on a Chinese watchtower. Also on this list are rock gardens, tea houses, and related ceremonies, as well as Japanese woodblock printing.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Stone and wood carving were prominent art forms used in architectural construction, decoration, and sculpture. Temples intended to house deities or shrines were constructed or rock-cut. Rock-cut caves containing Buddhist imagery, shrines, stupas, and monastic spaces span across Asia from India through Central Asia to China.</p>
<p>Japanese architecture often uses natural materials, such as wood, or follows Chinese architectural models with wood structures and tile roofs.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Painting in Asia usually took two forms—<strong>wall painting and manuscript</strong> or album painting. The painting styles that developed in India and East Asia favor contour drawing of forms over modeling.</p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Calligraphy</strong></h5>
<p>Calligraphy was an important art form in these regions. In China, calligraphy was considered the highest art form, even above painting.</p>
<p>Calligraphy was also prominent in Islamic art in Asia, and is found on architecture, decorative arts objects, and ceramic tiles, and in manuscripts written on paper, cloth, or vellum.</p>
<h5><strong>Textiles</strong></h5>
<p>Important textile forms from this region include <strong>silk</strong> and <strong>wool-tapestry weaving</strong>, <strong>cotton weaving</strong>, <strong>printing</strong>, <strong>painting</strong>, and <strong>carpet weaving</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Decorative Arts</strong></h5>
<p>Elegant and elaborate decorative programs featuring floral and animal designs are commonly found on decorative arts from East Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Gold and Jade Crown </strong>is a<strong> metalwork </strong>object<strong>, </strong>worn on the forehead, that<strong> measures 1 foot and 4 inches. </strong>The crown is lavish with ornamentation and elongated branch-like protrusions from which tiny <strong>gold discs</strong> and <strong>jade ornaments</strong> are attached.</p>
<p>The crown required very delicate and precise hammering as gold is a soft metal and jade is a hard material.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Work such as these were found in <strong>burials</strong> for royalty. Initially, historians believed this to be the sole purpose. Objects that were important in life were taken to the grave, but these crowns were also used in special and occasional <strong>ceremonial rites</strong> of the Silla royalty.</p>
<p>Silla used <strong>shamanistic practices</strong> in their ceremonies where Kings and Queens were significant players. The gold indicated the power of the wearer. A crown is also a visual marker of status.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols and Meanings</strong></h5>
<p>Three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke a sacred tree that once stood. It is believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi. </strong>Jade ornaments symbolized ripe fruit hanging from the tree branches as <strong>fertility and abundance. </strong>The antlers symbolized the power and speed of a deer. It is a sacred animal in Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries, Korea was divided into three kingdoms, with the <strong>Silla kingdom</strong> being the most powerful and wealthiest of all three. Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as <strong>a country of gold</strong>. Silla kings began to associate with gold and use it to identify royalty.</p>
<p>Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced <strong>shamanism</strong>. This is a type of nature worship which requires the expertise or mediation of a figure called a shaman who can facilitate communication between the gods and people. In shamanism Gods control nature. Humans are at the mercy of nature. The shaman intervenes on behalf of the people.</p>

<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> a set of two vases made from<strong> white porcelain with cobalt-blue underglaze </strong>each stand 2 feet tall<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a very specific kind of ceramic that is hard, white, brittle, and shiny. It gets the name from Marco Polo. Porcelain is close to the Italian name for a cowrie shell, and he thought it looked as shiny as a shell.</p>
<p><strong>Underglaze </strong>means the decoration is applied to the surface before it is glazed. This makes the decoration durable.</p>
<h5><strong>Parts of the Vase</strong></h5>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> are one of the most famous cultural specimens of Chinese porcelain art. As part of the collection of Sir David Percival, they received the eponymous title! Sir Percival was known to possess a vast collection of Chinaware. He bought 1500 pieces of china during the Chinese Civil War, in the early 20th century, from Dowager Empress Cixi. She sold them to gain funds for the war.</p>
<p>The pair of artifacts <strong>exhibit a far eastern and middle eastern merger</strong> concerning the shape and the motifs they manifest. The viewer should deliberately focus on this aspect of <strong>cultural exchange</strong>. At the same time, they have an inscription on the neck, which stands out vividly. The inscription mentions the name and date of the artifact.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The two David Vases are <strong>identical with similar forms, colors, and materials</strong>. Made from porcelain, they are supposedly denoted to the deteriorated versions made in bronze, which was prevalent in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
<p>The identical vases possess the shape of an elongated vase with a handle on the neck above the shoulder. The form has a cylindrical base that tapers inwards to acquire a balanced grip on the ground. Above the same, two moldings create initial lower sections. The main body of the vase forms an arch near the shoulder, which concludes with molding. The elongated neck, a bit lesser than the length of the main body, joins to the thick rim, forming the head of the vase. The <strong>handles are shaped in the form of an elephant head and trunk on both sides.</strong></p>
<p>The artisans, maintaining the minimalistic approach, have used <strong>blue pigment on the white porcelain</strong>. The <strong>design </strong>of the vases is a <strong>blend of animals and decorative foliage</strong>. The lower cylindrical body is divided into equal sections comprising <strong>symbolic motifs.</strong> The following section displays <strong>floral motifs</strong> while the main body has a <strong>single dragon</strong> with an undulating body covering the entire circumference. Following the molding with a decorative pattern, the first section has the form of <strong>a flying phoenix amidst clouds.</strong> Divided by protruding partitions, the upper neck section has a pattern of successively repetitive vertical leaves. The head of the vase shows alternating floral motifs with foliage.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> do not have a special function to serve because they were for the altar of a Daoist temple. However, they have a vivid inscription at the cusp of the shoulder and the neck above the band of the dragon. The inscription mentions the name of the official who commissioned these elegant pair of blue and white Chinese wares.</p>
<p>Porcelain was used to create the initial vases. They were then painted with blue pigment. Artists deglazed at the end, thereby increasing the longevity of the pigments. This process is called underglaze. Hence, the vases are still intact and continue to gleam the space.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Although the material of porcelain indicates the Chinese traditions, the visual elements are borrowed from the Middle eastern regions of art. The middle east Mesopotamia zone was an artistic hub that created many copper-inlaid-with-gold vases. The designs, apart from arabesque, also had human figures and inscriptions, which served as a document to the history of the ware. Hence, these traditions seemed to have penetrated in Chinese workshops with the Mongol invasion. The kingdom of Mongols had expanded over nearly all of Asia.</p>
<p>China was the lead producer of porcelain, and hence the products were typically known as chinaware. And, as it appears, the blue and white porcelain products are quintessentially Chinese. Some of the kilns made by China could reach 2200 Fahrenheit.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>With an easy to read and distinct inscription, we know that these vases were commissioned by Zhang Wenjin of Yushan county in 1351. Along with <strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong>, he also presented an incense burner to a Daoist temple in Xingyua (modern-day Wuyan county). Yushan county is situated 120 km from Jingdezhen, where the vases were apparently made.</p>
<p>The inscription descriptively mentions the professional background of Wenjin who was in the salt trade. He made these vases as an offering to the temple to appease the god for his sins. At the same time, he also wanted to protect his family from evil.</p>
<p><strong>The inscription reads:</strong></p>
<p>信州路。玉山縣。順城鄉。德教里。荊塘社。奉聖弟子。張文進。喜捨。香炉。花瓶。一付。祈保。合家清吉。子女平安。至正十一年。四月。良辰。謹記。星源。祖殿。胡淨一元帥。打供。</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Zhang Wenjin, from Jingtang community, Dejiao village, Shuncheng township, Yushan county, Xinzhou circuit, a disciple of the Holy Gods, is pleased to offer a set comprising one incense burner and a pair of flower vases to General Hu Jingyi at the original palace in Xingyuan, as a prayer for the protection and blessing of the whole family and the peace of his sons and daughters. Carefully offered on an auspicious day in the 4th month, 11th year of the Zhizheng reign.”</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>During this period of the 14th century, Mongols had captured the entire stretch of the middle east to the far east. This stimulated an enormous amount of exchange in art, culture, and commerce between the Yuan dynasty of China and the Ilkhan empire of Iran. The blue pigment or cobalt in chinaware was imported from the Iranian Ilkhan empire. At the same time, the form of the vases also reflects a similarity with the bronze vases, which was a popular art activity in the middle east. The motifs and the pattern were also a middle east influence.</p>

<p><strong>Portrait of Sin Sukju</strong> from the <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> is a hanging scroll made from <strong>ink and color on silk. The work </strong>measures<strong> 5 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches.</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Korean portraiture conventions, court artists painted subjects in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-length view</li>
<li>¾ turn</li>
<li>Only one ear showing</li>
<li>With crisp angular lines</li>
<li>Little to no modeling; mostly using lines to show folds of fabric or skin</li>
<li>Highly controlled brushwork</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This hanging scroll was meant <strong>to be displayed</strong>. Silk is a sign of <strong>status.</strong></p>
<p>Sin Sukju (1417-1475) is depicted as a “meritorious subject” and celebrated as Prime Minister. He was an official honored for his distinguished service at court and his loyalty to the king. These types of portraits were common for government workers.</p>
<p>These portraits were cherished by families and worshipped for generations. This is similar to Head of Roman Patrician with a focus on ancestral rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju is dressed in his official robes, with a black silk hat on his head.  He is shown as a Neoconfucian scholar. He sits with his hands folded neatly and concealed within his sleeves. Excessive fabric is a sign of wealth (think of Arnolfini Portrait!).</p>
<p>He wears a rank badge on his chest that was typically made of embroidered silk. This indicates the status of the official which ranged from emperor to local official. Images of birds identified rank. Sin Sukju’s badge shows a pair of peacocks amongst flowers and clouds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju was Prime Minister from 1461 – 1464, and again through 1471 – 1475.</p>
<p>The <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> was trained to capture the likeness of sitters, while adhering to pictorial conventions for illustrating government members. Imperial Bureau was the government school of artists that standardized painted images. Since images were so standardized, artists likely specialized in one area such as the face, hands, or robe.</p>
<p><strong>Sinification</strong> refers to the diffusion of Chinese culture to other regions. Koreans adopted not only Confucianism but also traditions of Chinese paintings. This was a sign of cross-culturation.</p>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> is a meditation on the transience of nature. It is the old versus new and a <strong>lesson of human existence</strong>. What was new will become old. Yet, there are merits to each part of life.</p>
<p>This work also contributes to an <strong>aesthetic pleasure</strong>. To decorate for one’s house in such an expensive way shows <strong>signs of status</strong>.</p>
<p>Folding screens were popular forms of art and interior décor.</p>
<h5><strong>The Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are <strong>two folding screens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the left </strong>the <strong>white plum tree</strong> grows off the paper. It is an older tree that bends downward. It flowers with a calm, mature, stable wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>On the right</strong> a <strong>red plum tree</strong> grows on the paper. It is younger, smaller, and grows upward. It has red buds that are bright, bold, energetic, and vibrant.</p>
<p>The <strong>stream</strong> at the center cuts through the pair of screens. It gives the sense of expanding form. The water looks to be moving because it is painted with swirls through <strong>tarashikomi.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Traditional Images of Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>It was common in Japan to use traditional images of nature to inspire meditation, contemplation, and a source of healing.</p>
<h5><strong>Rimpa Artists and Works</strong></h5>
<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, art historians termed artists like Korin “<strong>Rimpa</strong>” which literally means School of Korin.</p>
<p><strong>Rimpa work is characterized by</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction + naturalism</li>
<li>simplified compositions</li>
<li>sensuality in how the paint is applied with the <strong>tarashikomi </strong>method</li>
<li>Rimpa artists develop <strong>tarashikomi</strong> (wet on wet technique of applying and mixing paint; creates a swirly look)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rimpa artists were inspired by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>textiles (remember Korin’s family background)</li>
<li>ceramics</li>
<li>lacquerware which were all decorated in a traditional Japanese patterned manner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Favourite scenes included:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Passage of time</li>
<li>Seasons</li>
<li>Japanese literature (example: Tale of Genji – story of Heian Era extravagance)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ogata Korin (1658-1868) </strong>was the son of a merchant family who dealt in fabrics, and textiles for kimonos. Their clients included samurai and nobility. The family owned a lot of art by artists who used traditional Japanese flattening and decorative patterns. The artist was inspired by this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa </em></strong><strong>(Kanagawa oki nami ura),</strong> is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai. </strong>This is a<strong> polychrome woodblock print </strong>created with<strong> ink and color on paper. Part of the Series: <em>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em> </strong>it measures<strong> 10 by 14 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em>.</strong> Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled <em>Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji</em>.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a <strong>part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</strong></p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is a Japanese seascape <strong>Ukiyo-e print</strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The <strong>color palette</strong> is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong><strong> is a part of the series</strong>, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play<strong><em>, The Great Wave</em></strong> stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparent <strong>symbolism points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the Ukiyo-e print represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of <strong>a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang</strong>, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by <strong>Hokusai</strong>. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, <strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the ukiyo-e technique.</p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p><strong>Hokusai</strong> has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term <strong>Ukiyo-e means the floating world</strong>, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. Ukiyo-e prints were recognized by their <strong>emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</strong></p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>
<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the <strong>influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art</strong>. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><em><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> was created as one of the thirty-six prints <strong>by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.</strong> Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in <strong><em>The </em><em>Great Wave</em></strong>, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
