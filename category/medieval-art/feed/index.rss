										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ART AND INFLUENCE OF RELIGION</h2>
<h4><strong>ICONS OF FAITH</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Petra Redux</strong></h5>
<p>The city of <strong>Petra</strong> was the capital of the <strong>Nabataean Kingdom</strong> until 106 C.E., when Arabia was annexed by Emperor Trajan and absorbed into the Roman Empire. Petra flourished under Roman rule and continued to be the capital of the region. Petra is a unique city that consists of pink hue rock-cut architecture, and its many caves and façades are sculpted from the soft rock on the sides of cliffs.</p>
<p>A commercial city, Petra had experienced a large influx of cultural influence through trade routes and influence from Egyptian, Roman, and Ancient Near Eastern cultures. The<strong><em> Treasury</em></strong> and <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong>, like the <strong><em>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut</em></strong>, are carved in situ in the side of a cliff.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>reek and Roman influence are reflected in relief sculpture and Roman Corinthian-inspired columns used in the façade of the <strong><em>Treasury</em></strong> at Petra. While the façade of the <strong><em>Treasury</em></strong> is inspired by and uses Roman and Classical Greek conventions, the architect intentionally deviates by altering the width of the columns and using the conventions as ornamentation only. The <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong> at Petra has relief images of mythical animals similar to those used in the Babylonian and Persian empires.</p>

<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong> at Petra is a sacred precinct on the southern citadel hill, likely in an effort of the Nabateans to imitate Greek and Roman city centers. The temple is dedicated to the principal deity of Petra, Dushara, who is unique to Petra and paralleled with Zeus after Greek and Roman influence.</p>
<p>As worshipers enter the complex, they are surrounded by triple colonnades on the east and west side planned similarly to the Generic Greek (Peripteral) Temple Plan. Inside the colonnades is a <strong>lower temenos</strong>, which leads to the <strong>forecourt </strong>and the <strong>pronaos.</strong></p>
<p>Petra&#8217;s plan deviates from the traditional Generic Greek (Peripteral) Temple Plan.</p>
<p>Instead of a cells, there is a small theater or bouleuterion. This leads to the possibility that the temple functioned as a large palace and assembly hall.</p>

<h5><strong>Enter Christianity</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The middle of the 3rd century C.E. was an age of great social, economic, and military disarray in the Roman Empire. The reign of each emperor was usually brief. Rome once again regained a semblance of order under the leadership of Diocletian, who was declared emperor in 284 C.E. Diocletian wisely decided to share power with his potential rivals by establishing a <strong>tetrarchy</strong>.</p>
<p>Constantine, one of the junior tetrarchs, disrupted the tetrarchic system by invading Italy and defeating rival tetrarch Maxentius at the battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 C.E. This allowed him to take control of the Western half of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Constantine enacted many military, financial, administrative, and social reforms that strengthened the Western half, including the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E. This edict supported Christians in the Roman Empire, so that they no longer faced persecution. In fact, the emperor and some members of the Roman elite became the Christian church&#8217;s chief supporters and patrons. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to claim conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p>There were already Christians in the 1st century C.E., but art with Christian themes did not emerge until about 190 C.E. and was created during a period of intermittent persecution. This art reflects both the beliefs of the growing Christian communities and their adaptation of existing Roman artistic styles.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Biblical Knowledge</strong></h5>
<p>Art history is a pictorial document of cultural and religious events. It happened, it was illustrated, so now it can be studied to figure out what people used to do, where they came from, and most importantly, why.</p>
<p>To understand many Early Christian works of art, you need some <strong>Biblical knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Christians adopted the Hebrew Bible</strong> as the <strong>Old Testament</strong>, adding a <strong>New Testament</strong> that told of the life of Jesus, the earliest days of the Christian church, and the ultimate triumph of God in the final book of the Bible, Revelation.</p>
<p>Although <strong>Jesus and the earliest disciples were Jewish</strong>, most of his subsequent <strong>followers were gentiles</strong>. They included narratives from both the Hebrew Bible and their own Greco-Roman culture in the earliest Christian art, as various traditions intersect.</p>

<h5><strong>Art, Death, and Catacombs</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Etruscans used elaborate tombs and mausoleums within larger necropoleis to bury their dead, Jews and Christians used catacombs.</strong></p>
<p>The earliest Christian imagery in the Roman catacombs dates from about 200 C.E. The catacombs in Rome were cut out of a soft rock called tufa, and the walls were lined with loculi where bodies might be placed. <strong>Locul</strong>i line the walls in the gallery of the <strong><em>Catacomb of Priscilla</em></strong> in Rome.</p>
<p>The catacombs are believed to be named after the wife of a Roman consul. She converted to Christianity and as a result was sentenced to death. Originally, the loculi would have been covered with plaques inscribed with information about those buried and sometimes with simple drawings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2694" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Catacombs-of-Priscilla..jpg?resize=784%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="784" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Catacombs-of-Priscilla..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Catacombs-of-Priscilla..jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Catacombs of Priscilla.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Wealthy</strong></h5>
<p>Wealthier families usually had an entire chamber for their burial space, with marble s<strong>arcophagi</strong> to hold the bodies. Complex narratives were designed for the sarcophagi of wealthy patrons. <strong><em>The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</em></strong> combines the Judeo-Christian narrative with the deceased&#8217;s identity as a member of the Roman senatorial class. The style of the sarcophagus represents a new classicizing trend in the 4th century that departs from the harsh tetrarchic style of the late 3rd century. The front of the sarcophagus is composed of two registers, each subdivided by columns into sections that depict various scenes from the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</em>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Religious Narratives</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Religious narratives </strong>in the catacombs portray more than text could. Common motifs represent significant moments or testaments of the faith of the deceased’s life.</p>
<h5><strong>Good Shepherd</strong></h5>
<p>In many cases, Christians and Jews adopted and adapted imagery from the surrounding Roman culture for their own purposes. The motif of the good shepherd was adapted by Christians from images of shepherds popular in the surrounding Roman culture.</p>
<p>In the catacombs of Christians and in churches, this shepherd image was appropriated to represent Jesus, the &#8220;Good Shepherd&#8221; who gave his life for his sheep.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Orant Figure</strong></h5>
<p>Early Christian artists appropriated the orant figure, who raises hands in prayer, from the Roman culture to represent Christian devotees. The female <strong>orant figure</strong> is positioned between two other representations of her life.</p>
<p>In her marriage to the left and with a child to the right. This centralization of the orant figure emphasizes her conversion as a significant life event, like her marriage and the birth of her children.</p>

<h5><strong>Devine Deliverance</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, painters created simple narrative images drawn from the Christian Old and New Testaments to decorate the catacombs and other settings. Dominant were references to the miracles of Jesus or scenes in which faithful figures experienced <strong>divine deliverance</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, the story of Shadrack, Meshack, and Abednego, found in Daniel 3 of the Old Testament, was popular in this period. They would not bow down before the idol of the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar and were thrown into a fiery furnace as punishment but saved from destruction by God.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2700" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=772%2C544&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="772" height="544" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?w=772&amp;ssl=1 772w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=768%2C541&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Three Youths in the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In this catacomb painting, <strong>the three youths raise their arms in an orant gesture.</strong> Certainly, the theme of avoiding idolatry resonated in a culture full of such idols.</p>
<p>During the 3rd century, Christians found themselves in a position whereby refusing to participate in the imperial cult risked death. This led to the portrayal of deliverance from death. The prayers for the dead often referenced God&#8217;s deliverance of the three Hebrew youths and other figures as a paradigm for the ultimate deliverance of those who were buried in the catacombs.</p>
<h5><strong>Religious Storytelling</strong></h5>
<p>Despite Jesus’s earliest followers being Jewish, Christians interpret events in the Hebrew Bible to have their fullest meaning in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and in the subsequent history of the Christian church. Therefore, events drawn from the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament, are often contextualized and interpreted in Christian contexts as types, or patterns, that foreshadow events in the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>This <strong>typological means</strong> <strong>narratives would be depicted in Jewish and Christian contexts with very different meanings.</strong></p>
<p>The story of the prophet Jonah is shown in Early Christian art in the ceiling decoration of the <strong><em>Catacomb of Petrus and Marcellinus.</em></strong></p>
<p>The ceiling painting, divided by red bands against a white ground, is reminiscent of domestic painting in Rome during this period. The disc in the center is a medallion, and the semicircular areas on the wall below are lunettes.</p>
<p>The<strong><em> Good Shepherd</em></strong> symbolizes Jesus, with the motif of the lambs repeated in the lunettes below. We see three of the four phases from the narrative of Jonah surrounding. Jonah is shown thrown overboard, swallowed by a whale, spit up by the whale after three days in its belly, and finally reclining under a gourd tree.</p>

<p><strong>Good Shepard and Jonah Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Notice that Jonah emerges from the whale spreading his hands in prayer for deliverance in a way that echoes the surrounding orant figures and representations of Jesus as he departs the tomb.</p>
<p>Jesus compared himself to Jonah because he was in the tomb for three days, just as Jonah had been in the whale three days.</p>
<p>A similar mosaic from the <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> is of Justinian I, a Byzantinian emperor, and his attendants. Identifiers of his imperial power are in his clothing. He wears purple with a golden tableion, a richly jeweled crown, and a pendant broach.</p>
<p>Justinian holds the bowl containing the unleavened bread that was used in the Holy Communion and has a halo around his head. Though this is an <strong>important combination of religion and government</strong>, emperors of Constantinople were not considered gods or deified upon their deaths, which was considered idolatry in Christianity, as were emperors in Ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Justinian was not a high priest, as Roman consuls were. The high priest in Constantinople was the archbishop.</p>
<p>Justinian is portrayed as the largest figure, representative of his importance.</p>

<h5><strong>Constantinople Was Byzantium</strong></h5>
<p>The modern-day city of Istanbul, Turkey, was once referred to as Byzantium. It later became consecrated as <strong>Constantinople</strong> in May of 330 C.E. and was named <strong>after the Roman emperor Constantine,</strong> who made it the capitol of the Eastern Empire. Like Rome, it was governed by Roman law, had seven hills, and provided free entertainment and bread to its citizens.</p>
<p>The capital of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire was different from its Western sister-city; everyone spoke Greek, and their holy books and educational systems were in Greek.</p>
<p><strong>Constantinople was a Christian society</strong>. Muslims and Jews existed within its framework, but the emperor, as well as the church&#8217;s patriarch and most of its citizens, were Christian in their faith.</p>

<h5><strong>Byzantine Art </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>art and architecture of Byzantium was dominated by Christianity</strong> and is classified: <strong>early, middle, and late.</strong></p>
<p>There are three major influences in Byzantine art:</p>
<p><strong>Christian:</strong> A concern for spiritual imagery, as opposed to naturalistic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Antique:</strong> Byzantines were proud of their Classical heritage and often looked back to Classical Greece and Rome.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmopolitan:</strong> Constantinople stood on a crossroads between the Christian West and the Islamic East. Persia had great influence on Byzantine art.</p>

<h5><strong>Early Architecture: Hagia Sophia</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, or Church of Holy Wisdom, was the largest church in Christendom for a millennium. It was commissioned by Justinian I between 532 and 537 C.E.</p>
<p>It was built by two architects, Anthemios of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus. They were mathematicians who had never created anything of this scale before.</p>
<p>Completed, Hagia Sophia combines the longitudinal plan of a basilica with the vertical orientation that would eventually characterize most Byzantine churches.</p>

<p><strong>Plan for <em>Hagia Sophia.</em></strong></p>
<p>The use of <strong>numerical arrangements reflected Christian ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 for the Trinity</li>
<li>5 for the wounds of Christ</li>
<li>12 for the Twelve Apostles.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the east and west ends are half-circles, culminating in semi-domes (with five windows), each of which has three smaller semi-domes (with five windows), culminating in three apses. The north and south ends have five arches along the side aisles and seven arches in the galleries above, with 12 windows in the lunettes. The windows themselves are in two rows: one of seven, and one of five.</p>
<p>Early Byzantine churches, like <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, are simple on the outside. However, inside <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, the viewer is transported by the church&#8217;s majesty. Marbles of every color—some shipped from as far as Egypt—form the pillars, walls, and floors. Halls echo with the sound of choirs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hagia Sophia </em></strong>looks very different today than it did in the past. It retains its massive dome, but large buttresses and four minarets were added when the church was <strong>converted to a mosque by the Ottoman Turks</strong> with the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 C.E.</p>
<p>During the day, the 40 windows at the dome&#8217;s base make it look as though it is floating on light. At night, the light of thousands of candles gives the same impression to viewers looking at the dome from the outside.</p>
<p>The builders could incorporate so many windows into the dome because they used <strong>pendentives </strong>to shift the weight from the dome to piers, instead of walls. Because the walls do not support the dome, they could be pierced by many windows.</p>
<p>The use of light provides <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> with an otherworldly, spiritual characteristic of Byzantine art.</p>

<h5><strong>Early Architecture: San Vitale</strong></h5>
<p>The church of <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> was dedicated in the port town of Ravenna a decade after <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> was built in 547 C.E. This is not a Western-style church, despite being in Italy, because Justinian&#8217;s armies had recently reconquered the region.</p>
<p>Like the plan of <strong>Hagia Sophia</strong>, <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> shows two concentric octagons, with the inner one rising above the outer one. In the central space, eight columned arches separate eight piers. The ambulatory and gallery above it are interrupted by a cross-vaulted <strong>chancel</strong> that precedes the apse.</p>
<p>With all this symmetry, the asymmetrical <strong>narthex</strong> is unexpected and gives the church its signature look.</p>
<p>The <strong>sanctuary</strong> is covered with images and symbols that express the idea of Christ&#8217;s redemption of humanity and the reenactment the Lord&#8217;s Supper.</p>
<p>The celebration of Mass occurred on the lower level, and those in attendance witnessed the Mass processional from the upper balconies. This pulled the viewers into the action of the Mass.</p>

<h5><strong>Mosaics: something old, something new</strong></h5>
<p>Byzantine mosaics have features that are both a continuation of and a break with the ancient Mediterranean world. Mosaics take some characteristics, and they leave some behind. The frame around the mosaic is ancient. Intricate clothing is contemporary.</p>
<h5><strong>Theodora and her Attendants</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>
<p>Frames neatly compartmentalize mosaics with bursts of ornamentation.</p>
<p><strong>Faces</strong></p>
<p>A person depicted in a Byzantine mosaic usually faces front, with staring eyes. While his or her face can be expressive, the features themselves are usually stylized.</p>
<p><strong>Clothes</strong></p>
<p>Much of the complexity of Byzantine mosaics comes from the clothing. Stark, contrasting colors enhance the brilliancy of the drapery.</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>
<p>Byzantine bodies are elongated and generalized, their small, pointed feet dangling as if they float above the ground. They are usually outlined in black, enhancing their stark otherworldliness.</p>
<p><strong>Setting</strong></p>
<p>Mosaic backgrounds are simple, often just a gold field of color.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>
<p>In some Byzantine art, important people are larger and taller than less important people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Still Early Byzantine Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Ornamentation</strong></h5>
<p>For Byzantines, the more expensive the materials, the better the works of art. There was a decrease in large marble statuary and an increase in costly <strong>materials like metal, ivory, and glass</strong> in the early period. The glass industry was driven in part by demand for mosaic pieces, enamel for plating, and individual pieces for imperial court made of blue and purple glass.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of what is left of the famous Byzantine glass industry is shards. There was a decline of three-dimensional art (like sculpture in the round) in favor of two-dimensional art (like mosaics, frescoes, and enamels).</p>

<h5><strong>Representation</strong></h5>
<p>Though life-like portraiture was not popular, much of Byzantine art sought to represent people (and angels) individually. Byzantine artists did this by referring to complex Christian and Classical symbolism along with using straightforward Greek labels.</p>
<p>Byzantine images seek to tell a story, either a well-known one from the Bible, an exploit of an emperor or empress, or the heroic actions of a saint.</p>

<h4><strong>Narration</strong></h4>
<p>The word Byzantine today is synonymous with ornamentation. Byzantines employed many elaborate styles of decoration—an elaborate gold frame around an icon, busy geometric patterns on clothing, or thousands of angels crowding an upper register.</p>
<p>Greek letters are decorative and informative, and repeating motifs of flowers and animals are similar to neighboring Islamic art.</p>

<p><em><strong>Barberini Ivory.</strong></em></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Barberini Ivory</em></strong> was once part of an imperial <strong>diptych</strong> celebrating the military triumph of an emperor and represents an intersection of Classical imagery and Byzantine art. <strong>At the center is the emperor</strong> (possibly Justinian) on a horse. Note that he is larger than everything else and carved in higher relief.</p>
<p>In the same panel, Classical elements include a winged representation of Victory flying beside him and a personification of the fertile Earth beneath him. <strong>To his side and behind him</strong> is a barely visible conquered enemy, likely Muslim. More conquered people bearing gifts make up the <strong>lower register</strong>. In the <strong>left </strong>panel, a general holds a statue of Victory. Above the emperor are winged angels surrounding an image of Christ, who gives sanction to the emperor&#8217;s actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Archangel Michael.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em>The<strong> <em>Archangel Michael</em> </strong>comes from an ivory <strong>diptych</strong> of the 6th century C.E. A representation of the Archangel Michael, it uses Classical elements including the <strong>wet drapery technique</strong>, Michael&#8217;s facial expression, and the orb of power he bears in his hand. The orb is surmounted by a Christian cross signifying Christ&#8217;s dominion over Earth. There is a change in perspective: Michael is in front of the pillars from the waist up, but his feet are on the steps behind the pillars.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shroud of Charlemagne </strong>is a silken cloth manufactured in Constantinople in 814 C.E. It depicts a large man riding a chariot. Smaller figures are nearby, not touching him. Note the frontal, linear nature of all the figures and the many ornamental circles with their stylized, repeating motifs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Apse Mosaic</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2719" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="722" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>All the figures in the <strong><em>Apse Mosaic and Choir of San Vitale</em></strong> are flat, symbolic, and isolated, lacking three-dimensional representation. There is no overlapping of figures, nor are there natural poses. While Classical, naturalistic poses will make a comeback from time to time in Byzantium, the Byzantine linear form is firmly established, with its focus on spirituality and detail<strong>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Icons and Iconoclasm</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Byzantine art</strong> is characterized by <strong>icons and highly stylized conventions</strong>. The icon <strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong> from the Monastery of St. Catherine portrays Mary, the mother of God <strong>(Theotokos),</strong> enthroned with an infant Christ, flanked by two saints, with angels rising in the background.</p>
<p>An icon like this would be displayed at a church or in smaller form at a private home. All figures are flat and frontal, wearing textured drapery and floating atop small, pointed feet and demonstrate the distinctly Byzantine style.</p>
<p><strong>Early or late, what’s the difference?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, <strong>Early Byzantine</strong> is marked by the <strong>three F&#8217;s—flat, frontal, and floating</strong>. As the period progressed, so did the portrayal of perspective and dimension. If someone is floating, you know what period they belong in.</p>
<p>People soon started spreading rumors about the mystical properties of these spiritual, otherworldly icons. Some icons spoke, cried, or bled. Some were said to be <strong>acheropoietes</strong>.</p>
<p>The Virgin of Vladimir is a middle-period Byzantine icon. She is characteristic of the Byzantine style, evident in the flat gold background, stylized but expressive face, elongated proportions, and ornamentally folded drapery.</p>
<p>Some members of the clergy condemned what they saw as a violation of the second commandment, which bans the use of idols. This influenced Emperor Leo III, who was having a difficult time as Islamic armies kept defeating him. After a major volcanic eruption in 726 C.E. darkened the skies over Constantinople for days, Leo III decided that the hand of God had been withdrawn from his city because icons were being used as idols.</p>
<p>Once Leo III banned icon use, he started to win battles. This began a tradition of <strong>iconoclast</strong> emperors. During this movement, known as <strong>iconoclasm</strong>, church mosaics were painted over with lime and replaced by secular or natural images. Eventually, the widowed Empress Theodora stopped iconoclasm while acting as regent for her son, Michael III, in 843 C.E.</p>

<p><strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George</em>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Triumph of Orthodoxy</em></strong> was made in the late Byzantine Period as part of a commemorative celebration of the end of iconoclasm.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Theotokos</strong> is enthroned in the center of the upper register. <strong>Empress Theodora and her young son</strong> take up the left. <strong>On the right</strong> is Patriarch Methodios, a man who had been tortured and imprisoned due to his love of icons and who had been raised to his post by Theodora herself.</p>
<p>In the <strong>lower register</strong> are saints, some holding icons. The background is the now typical gold. The figures are largely frontal, though there is overlapping. A few floating feet are visible. Contrasting colors are the most obvious part of this picture. The overall impression is of an intensely stylized icon-painting tradition.</p>
<p>Icons, of all Byzantine work, are usually the most rigid in form. This is partly due to the popularity of set images among the people and to the standards set by defiant defenders of icons.</p>

<p>The middle period of Byzantine art (834–1204 C.E.) begins at the end of iconoclasm. A new dynasty of Macedonian kings led by Basil I patronized the renaissance of Classical forms. This period is characterized by a renewed interest in Classical references and design. However, this initial resurgence of naturalistic art was then followed by increasing emphasis on elongated forms.</p>
<p>One of the first things the Macedonian emperors did was repair churches mutilated by iconoclasm. In 867 C.E., a new apse mosaic was added to <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>. It depicts a seated Mary Theotokos who doesn&#8217;t seem to be hovering entirely by herself. Her seat shows an attempt at three-dimensionality. Her body is more realistic; you can see her legs through the folds of her clothing. Her attitude toward her child is tender, and her hands are clearly rendered and emotive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Theotokos and Child from the apse mosaic</em></strong>. <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, <strong>Istanbul (Constantinople). 867 C.E. Mosaic.</strong></p>
<p>Perspective and emotion characterized the Middle Period. Faces are generalized, Christ&#8217;s clothing is flat, and the contrasting palette and flat gold background are stark.</p>
<p><strong>Triptychs overcame diptychs in popularity</strong> during the Middle Period. The <strong><em>Harbaville Triptych</em></strong>, made of ivory, displays Christ with Mary and St. John in the upper register of the central panel, with apostles below. Saints decorate the doors.</p>
<p>Note the frontal figures and the elongated feet, raised up on blocks. The figures on the lower registers are all wearing Classical togas, but the drapery is very flat. A decorative plant motif separates the registers in the central panel.</p>
<p>This work begins the decline of classical features and moves toward a new stylistic portrayal: bodies become more elongated and manneristic, and designs become more intricate and ornate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2724" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harbaville-Triptych.-Constantinople.-ca.-950-C.E.-Ivory..jpg?resize=694%2C532&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="694" height="532" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harbaville-Triptych.-Constantinople.-ca.-950-C.E.-Ivory..jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harbaville-Triptych.-Constantinople.-ca.-950-C.E.-Ivory..jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5><strong>More Ivory</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> was carved for al-Mughira, the youngest son of an Umayyad caliph, as a gift for his eighteenth birthday. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is a cylindrical container, usually used to contain perfume or cosmetics, that was traditionally given to members of royal families to commemorate special occasions and featured symbols of royal power and privilege, like hunting scenes and musical entertainments. The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> is has figural representation and is therefore <strong>not aniconic</strong>.</p>
<p>Art historians think that the symbolism represented in the pyxis illustrates the struggle between the Umayyads the Abasids, another Muslim group vying for power, and that it also served as an invitation to al-Mughira to gather power in hopes that he would be caliph. Therefore, <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> functioned as a container, a gift of luxury, and as a political work designed to serve as royal propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>Inscription</strong></p>
<p>The inscription at the base of the lid of the pyxis says &#8220;God&#8217;s blessing, favors, and happiness to a-Mughira, son of the commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him in the year 357 [968 C.E.].&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ivory</strong></p>
<p>The use of <strong>ivory</strong> is significant as it has been considered a luxury item since ancient times. Ivory objects have been found from prehistory, ancient Egypt, China, Japan, and India. While there are no surviving examples from ancient Greece, writings indicate they existed.</p>
<p><strong>Medallions</strong></p>
<p>The pyxis has four medallions, each with 8 lobes, that contain Umayyad symbolism, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scene of the attack of two bulls by two lions, which is a symbol of Umayyad victory.</li>
<li>Two men on horseback retrieving eggs from falcon nests, which symbolize the Umayyads as they were known as &#8220;the falcons of the Quraysh&#8221; and may be a symbol of the Umayyads claim to the throne.</li>
<li>A lute player between two figures, one holding a staff and a bottle, which are symbols of a ruler, the other holding a fan, thought to be a representative of the Abassids.</li>
<li>Figures riding on horseback and collecting dates from trees symbolizing the Umayyads conquering lands under Abbasid control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Decoration</strong></p>
<p>The medallions are surrounded by figures and animals that include falconers, wrestlers, griffons, peacocks, birds, goats, and animals to be hunted. The decoration is intricate and covers the entire visible surface of the pyxis.</p>

<h5><strong>A Time Without Art</strong></h5>
<p>The Middle and Late periods of <strong>Byzantine art</strong> are separated by a gulf of artless space from 1204 to 1261 C.E. This is when Constantinople was sacked by an army of the Fourth Crusade. The Latin invaders built nothing. They put up a puppet state, melting Byzantine metalwork and shipping off much of the city&#8217;s wealth.</p>
<p>When Michael VIII led the restoration of the city, poorer materials were used. Frescoes were more common than mosaics. Paper replaced parchment, and bookmaking diminished. Gold was replaced by silver gilt, pewter, and ceramic—even in the imperial court. Tradition and imitation of older work dominated. Extremities got even smaller and less detailed. Drapery was flat and angular.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Crusaders in Constantinople</em></strong>.</h5>
<p>By the 1400s, Constantinople was in ruins. Centuries of warfare had finally seen an end to the golden city.</p>
<p>Following an invasion by the Ottoman Turks, Constantinople was destroyed and renamed Istanbul in 1453 C.E. Its people were scattered. Some brought the learning of the Greeks back to the West, while some went north, where Russia stood to inherit the traditions of the Orthodox church.</p>
<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Petra, a commercial city that had architectural and artistic styles that resulted from numerous external cultural influences, became a part of the Roman Empire in 106 C.E. Constantine became the emperor of Western part of the Roman Empire and issued the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E., which ceased the persecution Christians were facing at the time. Art with Christian themes began to emerge in 190 C.E. Pagans, Jews, and Christians used catacombs that were often painted or had mosaics with religious narrative. The city of Byzantium became Constantinople and was a Christian society. Its art reflected Christian imagery and narrative, Classical heritage and cultural influence from Persia and other cultures.</p>

<h4><strong>Medieval Art and Influence of Religion</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>The Big Three</strong></h4>
<p>There are commonalities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. All three are <strong>monotheistic religions</strong> that have much basis in the Hebrew Bible. The spread of <strong>these religions impacted medieval art</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medieval art</strong> is driven by the requirements of <strong>worship, elite or court culture, and learning</strong>.</p>
<p>You have already learned about Islam and Christianity. Let’s explore <strong>how Judaism is interconnected with the Roman Empire and art of the medieval period.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Judaism</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2414" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=975%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Judaism believes in one just and fair god</strong> who is concerned with the actions of humankind. it is extrapolated from the Tanakh, or Hebrew bible, which was developed over a millennium and consists of the <strong>Torah, Nevi’im, and Ketuvim</strong>. The Hebrew bible prophesies that a messiah, promised deliverer of the Jewish nation, will come, and bring an age of universal peace and recognition of God. Judaism holds that this event has not yet happened.</p>
<h5><strong>Christianity</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2415" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=975%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Christianity is rooted in Judaism</strong>, but the two religions deviated from each other in the 1st century C.E. Christians incorporated the Hebrew bible as their Old Testament and have the same beliefs in the nature of God. They believe that prophesies of the Old Testament were fulfilled through Jesus, and the New Testament tells of the life of Jesus, the earliest days of the Christian church, letters of encouragement, and prophesies of what is to come.</p>
<h5><strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Roman Empire greatly impacted followers of Judaism</strong>. The Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonians in 586 B.C.E. The Second Temple was rebuilt as a replacement by 515 B.C.E. and was destroyed by Titus, the future emperor of Rome, in 70 C.E.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, synagogues rose to prominence as &#8220;little temples&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Synagogues</strong> adopted some of the functions of the destroyed Temple. <strong>Some synagogues were decorated with images depicting narratives from the Hebrew Bible</strong> beginning in the 3rd century C.E. The most extensive example discovered to date comes <strong>from the city of Dura-Europos</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>West Wall</strong></h5>
<p>The best-preserved part of the <strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue&#8217;s assembly hall is its west wall,</strong> with its focus on the niche that once held a wooden cabinet for the <strong>Torah</strong>. This is significant as it indicated the beginning of directional worship in Judaism. The west-facing niche enabled individuals to worship the scrolls and Jerusalem at the same time.</p>
<p>The <strong>three levels of narrative panels</strong> on the surrounding walls represent several scenes from the Hebrew Bible that recount the history of Israel in ways that connect to the Jewish community that worshipped there. A simple temple image marks the Torah shrine.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2416" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?resize=986%2C605&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="986" height="605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>West wall of assembly hall with view of Torah shrine</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Exodus</strong></h5>
<p>In this detail from the <strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue paintings</strong>, we see part of the <strong>narrative in which the God of Israel delivered his people from slavery in Egypt by miraculously parting the Red Sea</strong> so that they could pass through. Like a Hebrew or Aramaic text, the <strong>narrative is read from right to left.</strong></p>
<p>Although <strong>Moses</strong> wields his staff, the presence of the large hands above—symbolic of the intervention of Israel&#8217;s God—is what truly has power to bring about the miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue</strong> does not contain an image of Israel&#8217;s god. Instead, <strong>symbols indicate divine involvemen</strong>t in the narrative like the hands from above or images of fire.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2417" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?resize=990%2C605&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Exodus (Moses and Israelites crossing the Red Sea).</strong></p>
<p>The Hebrew Bible depicts a nonphysical character of Israel&#8217;s god and contains various prohibitions against representing this god or creating images of other gods to worship, <strong>similar to aniconism in Islam</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Just a Book? Not Quite</strong></h5>
<p>One of the <strong>luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the illuminated manuscript</strong>. The earliest written documents were <strong>made of papyrus, parchment, or vellum and created in scroll form</strong> and functioned as an editable way <strong>to keep written text</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 1st century C.E., <strong>the codex</strong>, similar in format to a modern book, came into existence. A gathering of several sheets of folded vellum or parchment, this evolved in the 4th century to replace the scroll, as the scrolls were difficult to store and to access specific information quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The Vienna Genesis</strong> is a luxury manuscript made of <strong>purple dyed vellum with gold and silver writing</strong>. The <strong>purple dye is significant</strong>, as it was <strong>associated with royalty</strong>. Also was used to give imperial cloth its distinctive color—evidence of the high value placed on the manuscript.</p>
<p>It has several illuminations at the bottom of its pages. There is a continuous narrative, in a style similar to <em>Last judgment of Hu-Nefer</em>, recounting the story of Rebecca and Eliezer at the well, depicting the servant Eliezer finding a wife for Isaac, Abraham’s son.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2418" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?resize=600%2C766&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="766" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?resize=235%2C300&amp;ssl=1 235w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well, from the Vienna Genesis</strong></p>
<p>In the first episode, Rebecca leaves the city of Nahor to draw water from the well. In the second episode, she offers water to Eliezer and his camels. The city of Nahor is portrayed as a walled city in the background, like cityscapes in Roman Second Style paintings. There is also a partially nude female sitting on the well, a personification of the spring source of the well water. Both are <strong>evidence of the classical motifs and stylistic influence in Early Christian art.</strong></p>
<p>Another page shows <em>Jacob Wrestling the Angel</em>, also in continuous narrative. There are several episodes depicting Jacob’s journey and his encounter with the angel going from left to right and then twisting around and back to the left.

<p>Christianity during the Middle Ages placed increasing emphasis on the power of the book.</p>

<h5><strong>Only the Wealthy</strong></h5>
<p>Wealth was the determining factor when it comes to illuminated manuscripts. These books were labor-intensive and comprised of expensive materials. They were valuable and commissioned by rulers and the wealthy. Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry was commissioned by the Duke of Berry, his name says it all—wealthy patron.</p>

<p><strong>The Coronation Gospels Codex</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts</strong> became some of the most valuable, portable objects of the time, not only because they were frequently <strong>embossed with gold and inlaid with gems</strong>, but because <strong>creating, possessing, and reading them were acts of piety</strong>.</p>
<p>Historians have been able to determine the wealth of a site simply according to the number of books produced.</p>
<p>Many <strong>illuminated manuscripts</strong> from the Carolingian Period are liturgies or <strong>Gospel Books: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John from the New Testament</strong>. Gospel Books were needed across the kingdom to meet the needs of newly built churches and monasteries.</p>
<p>These books were handwritten, illuminated, and authenticated as true to the original word. Illuminated Gospel Books were often used at a ruler’s coronation service, so many illuminated manuscripts became <strong>known as Coronation Gospels</strong>, and imperial patronage drove the production of illuminated manuscripts.</p>
<h5><strong>And the Empire Fell</strong></h5>
<p>The word <strong>medieval comes from the Latin medioaevum, meaning Middle Ages</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Medieval Period is the time between the end of classical Greco-Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Renaissance</strong>, the rebirth of classical civilization.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages can be defined, roughly, as the period in European history between the <strong>7th and the early 11th centuries C.E.</strong></p>
<p>Although <strong>medieval art</strong> has sometimes been dismissed as a barbarous decline from the standards of classical antiquity, <strong>the period produced many innovative and artistic forms of expression</strong>. Some of the earliest medieval art comes from the migration period. During this period, nomadic, nomadic non-Christian people (the <strong>Celts, Franks, Anglo–Saxons, and Vikings</strong>) produced art of great skill.</p>

<p>During the late 8th century C.E., the Vikings came forth from Scandinavia and began to plunder parts of northern Europe. In some cases, they established colonies. The Vikings traveled as far as Novgorod in Russia and North America.</p>
<h5><strong>Funerary Objects, Medieval Style</strong></h5>
<p>As the power of the Roman Empire receded, non-Roman peoples began to settle across Europe. These peoples often had little familiarity with the classical tradition of artistic representation and, initially, were nomadic. Art produced was often portable, but of high quality and is categorized as animal-style art.</p>
<h5><strong>Portable is significant?</strong></h5>
<p>Yes. Portable means moveable. And, if moved far enough, it will impact another culture. And now you have another example of cross-cultural fertilization.</p>
<h5><strong>Purse cover</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Purse cover</strong>, metalworking, and other kinds of funerary objects were retrieved from the Sutton Hoo ship burial site, <strong>crafted in cloisonné</strong>, is characterized by two features:</p>
<p><strong>Interlace patterns</strong>: Interlace is derived from Roman ornamentation, but the heads of monsters are new additions.</p>
<p><strong>Animal motifs:</strong> Abstract depictions of animals have been woven together as part of the decorative patterns of the purse cover. The <strong>two motifs in the center portray falcons devouring ducks</strong>. The <strong>two outer motifs represent a human figure between two beasts</strong>, in a similar style as the Bull-headed lyre. Here, the male figures are abstracted almost beyond recognition.</p>

<h5><strong>Shoulder clasp</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shoulder clasp</strong> (closed) retrieved from Sutton Hoo ship burial site consists of two curved parts connected with a pin that serves as a hinge. A panel on each side is <strong>decorated with millefiori </strong>insets. <strong>Interlace patterns</strong> around the borders of the clasp become <strong>serpents</strong>, which are staples of poetry from an early period in Ireland.</p>

<h5><strong>Animal head post</strong></h5>
<p>The ship from the Sutton Hoo burial site is in ruins. However, during a later period, another people, the Vikings, produced a fantastic ship that has been preserved. The 70-foot-long ship was used for burial and was covered over by a burial mound.</p>
<p>The <strong>Animal head post</strong> from the ship gives an idea of the intricacy of the ship’s decoration. Like the metal work from the Sutton Hoo burial site, it is decorated with a complex interlace design and the post becomes a beast intended to intimidate.</p>

<h5><strong>Merovingian looped fibula</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Merovingian looped fibula</strong> were likely the possessions of a wealthy Merovingian woman and were intended to accompany their owner into the afterlife. There are decorative patterns covering the entire surface of each of the fibulae.</p>
<p>These patterns adjust to the shape of the object, amplify the form and structure, and therefore become an organic part of the pins. A fish is incorporated below the center of each pin, and the looped forms around the edges are stylized eagles’ heads, evidence of the inclusion of abstract animal forms.</p>

<h5><strong>Manuscripts Brought to You From the British Isles</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Art of the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings</strong> served as the basis for some of the earliest Christian art in northern Europe. In addition to the Christian faith, Christian missionaries brought literacy to the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings. This led to the early medieval period production of the illuminated manuscript. The Gospel Book was quite popular.</p>
<p>Manuscripts from the British Isles reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.</p>
<p>They were produced in monasteries on the islands of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Another term sometimes used is <strong>Hiberno-Saxon art</strong>, a name that reflects the influence of the Irish monastic movement.</p>

<p><strong>The Arrest of Christ. Folio 114r. Book of Kells. ca. late 8th-early 9th century C.E. Tempera on vellum.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Book of Durrow </strong>is the earliest extant example of <strong>Hiberno-Saxon Gospel Books</strong>. It is <strong>named for the town in Ireland where it was kept</strong> in the later medieval period, but its <strong>origin is unknown</strong>.</p>
<p>One likely candidate is the monastery on Iona founded by St. Columba during the 6th century. Vikings attacked Iona during the late 8th century. It is possible that the book was taken to Durrow in the wake of this disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Incipit. Gospel of Mark. Folio 86 recto from the Book of Durrow. ca. 660–680 C.E. Ink and tempera on parchment.</strong></p>
<p>Each of the gospels begins with an <strong>incipit page</strong>, in which lavish decoration emphasizes the first letter of the text. In this example, which opens the Gospel of Mark, <strong>the I</strong> and the first part of the &#8220;N&#8221; that <strong>begin the word Initium </strong>are composed of <strong>interlace patterns and Celtic spirals</strong> that resemble the patterns in metalwork from the arts produced by Celtic and Anglo-Saxon artisans.</p>
<p>The letters and words that follow grow smaller and less elaborate. In addition to beautifying a holy book, the incipit pages have the practical purpose of helping the reader locate sections in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Evangelist Symbol</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2426" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?resize=600%2C861&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="861" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?w=331&amp;ssl=1 331w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>PHOTO: Man, symbol for Saint Matthew. Folio 21 verso from the Book of Durrow. ca. 660–680 C.E. Ink and tempera on parchment</strong>.</p>
<p>Each gospel also begins with a full-page image containing an<strong> evangelist symbol</strong>. On this page, surrounded by an interlace border, the figure of a man looks like a checkerboard with legs and a head. He has the <strong>elements of Byzantine stylization: floating, flat, and frontal</strong>. The body of the man resembles the millefiori pattern of the shoulder clasp from Sutton Hoo.</p>
<p>The floating figure is flattened, with the legs shown from the side, whereas the head is positioned frontally. Despite the extreme stylization of the figure, there are also some realistic details—in particular, the figure is <strong>shown with the hairstyle of an Irish monk</strong>, with the head shaved at the front.</p>
<h5><strong>The Lindisfarne Gospels</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Lindisfarne Gospels</strong> were <strong>written in the monastery of Lindisfarne in England</strong> and remained there until Viking raiders drove the monks out.</p>

<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Matthew, cross-carpet page.</strong></p>
<p>Like the <em>Book of Durrow</em>, it reflects the influence of migration period patterns. In this <strong>carpet page</strong>, we can see intricate interlace and millefiori patterns. Here the patterns have resolved themselves into a cross, as if this symbol of Christian faith had tamed the powers represented by the birds and other creatures that skulk in the margins.</p>

<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Luke incipit page.</strong></p>
<p>The Lindisfarne Gospels also include evangelist portraits, a type of image derived from early Roman Christian art. Indeed, there is strong evidence that the portraits may be copies, or at least variations on manuscript sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2429" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?resize=600%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?w=761&amp;ssl=1 761w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Luke portrait page.</strong></p>
<p>In this image, <strong>the evangelist Luke</strong> is clearly derived from Roman sources, but is remade in the visual idiom of the <strong>Hiberno-Saxon</strong> tradition. The image shows Matthew writing his gospel, and his symbol is depicted above him. The folds of Luke’s garments have been transformed into an abstract pattern, as have the evangelist’s locks of hair.</p>
<h5><strong>It’s All Narrative</strong></h5>
<p>You have experienced narrative art in different forms. The <em>Vienna Genesis</em> uses continuous narrative to recount biblical stories. The narrative of the <em>Column of Trajan</em> detailed Trajan’s victorious campaigns against the Dacians spiraling upward around the column. The <em>Ludovisi Battle Sarcophagus</em> uses forceful diagonals, dramatic contrasts, twisting figures, and emotional expressionism to convey the story of a chaotic battle scene between Romans and a northern enemy. How does art in other cultures express narrative?</p>

<h5><strong>The Bayeux Tapestry</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Bayeux Tapestry </strong>is not a real tapestry, in which figures are woven in with the thread, but <strong>an embroidered work of art,</strong> in which colored wool was stitched onto a linen background. It resembles a long comic strip made of cloth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The narrative style is a <strong>combination of pictographic Byzantine codices and Romanesque illumination.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>58 surviving scenes</strong> describe the history of the conflict, William of Normandy’s conquest, the Battle of Hastings, and the aftermath. The Battle of Hastings began when England&#8217;s King Edward the Confessor died in 1066 C.E. William of Normandy was a relative of King Edward, but Harold Godwinson was crowned king. That same year, William sailed for England, slew Harold in battle, and took the crown for himself.</p>
<p>In The Bad Omen episode of the <strong>Bayeux Tapestry</strong>, a comet flies above Harold&#8217;s palace, making its occupants uneasy. In medieval astrology, comets foretold unsettling events. This comet signifies the coming invasion of England.</p>
<p>This scene shares many aspects with illuminated manuscripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Latin words floating overhead are much like Byzantines&#8217; Greek interjections.</li>
<li>Large, bright blocks of color used in the clothing lend an almost cartoonish quality to the narratives, contrasting with the realistic presentation of the figures in the Column of Trajan.</li>
<li>The blocks of color are typical of Romanesque illumination and of most art of the period.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Medieval period</strong> is classified as <strong>the time between the end of classical Greco-Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Renaissance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medieval art was greatly impacted by the requirements of Jewish, Christian, or Islamic worship</strong>. One of the luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the <strong>illuminated manuscript</strong>. The art produced by nomadic, non-Roman peoples was often portable but of high quality and is <strong>categorized with animal-style art.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of <strong>metalworking and other kinds of funerary objects were found in the remains of a ship at the Sutton Hoo ship burial in Suffolk, England</strong>. Manuscripts from the British Isles like the <strong><em>Book of Kells, the Book of Durrow, </em></strong><em>and <strong>the Lindisfarne Gospels</strong></em> reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Roman Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The term Romanesque describes architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Romanesque</strong> reflects certain Roman techniques, such as the <strong>barrel vault</strong> and the <strong>round arch</strong>. Several stylistic sources mark the Romanesque period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The legacy of Roman Imperial or Late Antique/Early Christian architecture and sculpture—seen in the use of Roman style masonry vaulting, rather than wooden roofs, and the reintroduction of monumental architectural sculpture in stone.</li>
<li>Continuity with the traditions of Carolingian and Ottonian art</li>
<li>The influence of Byzantine and Islamic art</li>
</ul>
<p>During the <strong>Romanesque</strong> period, the <strong>Holy Roman Empire</strong> included much of what is now Germany and Northern Italy. The<strong> Salian dynasty</strong> replaced the Ottonian dynasty in the 11th century; and the Ottonian and Early Christian influence is visible in architecture as masons began to adopt Romanesque innovations in masonry.</p>

As Romanesque was influenced, in turn Romanesque stylistic qualities influenced the early development of Gothic architecture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of the use of pointed windows to help distribute weight more efficiently</li>
<li>Early experimentation with vaulting techniques, such as groin vaults and the use of <strong>ribs</strong></li>
<li>Use of segmented units to construct a regular plan</li>
<li>Rhythmic elaboration of the interior elevation and <strong>nave arcade</strong></li>
<li>The addition of the east end of the church (as in the development of the pilgrimage choir)</li>
<li>The elaboration of Carolingian west work into a dramatic two-towered entrance</li>

<h5><strong>Gothic, Not the Trend You Thought It Was</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Gothic period</strong>, known as the age of the great cathedrals, began in approximately 1150 C.E. and lasted until about 1400 C.E. Although it originated in France, the Gothic style spread throughout Western Europe to become the first truly International Style. The Gothic aesthetic encompassed a wide range of structures and media, including churches, palaces, and portraits.</p>
<p>Gothic architecture is best defined as the &#8220;quest for height and light&#8221;, considered to be an opposing pole to the Classical Greco-Roman styles in Europe. The heart of the Gothic aesthetic was the belief that divinity could be experienced through the senses, and Gothic architecture sought to connect viewers to the heavens with high, soaring vaults; bright, multicolored lights; and echoing sounds.</p>

<p>The characteristic forms of Gothic emphasized and facilitated this heavenly encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>lofty masonry that reached toward the heavens</li>
<li>complex, ornate lines with elegant patterns</li>
<li>high, thin walls with great expanses of richly colored stained glass in large windows that allowed for extensive light</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>Elaborated architecture to support a socio-political development</p>
<p>Now that you know the characteristics—Gothic art and architecture is crazy elaborate—it’s time to move on to what it’s about: the social and political stuff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Elite Learning in Byzantium</h2>
<blockquote><p>The Early Byzantium exudes a Christian-Hellenistic duality. The mythologically decorated silverware of Byzantium sets a trap for us, the one of the pagan subject – only to force us to later acknowledge that the nymphs and satyrs were replaced in by revelers of a prosperous proto-Christian world in which the Byzantine elites banqueted and triumphed like the Greek and Roman gods themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling classes of Byzantium were defined by paideia-learning. The young Byzantines learned science in the pagan Hellenistic way based on nature, on things, on the universe, which allowed them to &#8220;situate themselves&#8221; in the world. They also learned using Graeco-Roman and Christian texts. These &#8220;classical&#8221; texts not only that offered support for their thought, but also carried a long tradition, and eventually integrated the elite children in a culture shared both with their ancestors and with their contemporaries.</p>

<p>While Christianity prevailed in the Byzantine empire, the Hellenistic influence was also strong to the point of transcending regimes, ideologies and political upheavals. Excerpted and annotated the Graeco-Roman texts were used to erect the solid foundation of that constituted the unique Byzantine culture. The thread of this classical tradition is perceptible in the <strong>Byzantine collection of silverware sets of the Dumbarton Oaks Museum</strong>.</p>
<p>Brief reminders of the classical texts and their historical development allowed art historians to decode the meaning and role of the mythologically inspired silverware, such as the<strong> <em>Bowl with a Dionysiac Procession.</em></strong> The mythological aesthetics of <strong>early Byzantine silver-works</strong> are rarely ritualistic, reflecting instead the Byzantine elites’ sophistication and their cultural attachment to the myths and texts defining the Graeco-Roman social values system.<sup>1</sup>This 5th century AC silver bowl adopted neutral revelry motifs, voluntarily reducing the distance between a recently Christianized society and classical Greek culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Tertullian&#8217;s Apology for the Christians </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;&#8230; now I see the enormous entertainments, with new names from their extravagance ; &#8230;; and I see mines of silver melted into dishes, &#8230; I see also theatres in abundance, and all indulgingly covered over.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going back in the history of teaching in the West, we encounter Greek children learning the Homeric poems by heart and then preparing themselves, by rhetorical training, for the eloquence of the tribune. In various forms, the learning of the ancient Greece stayed with us, while being extended to new conceptions of the world, whether linked to Christianity, such as scholasticism, or characteristics of the modern world, such as scientific thought.</p>
<p>In modern times, the stakes of teaching the &#8220;Classics&#8221; have continued to shift, but throughout the history of pedagogy in the early Byzantium, the classical texts had an overwhelming position. Mirroring the teachings they received, the elites of the Byzantine empire surrounded themselves with household items underlining the conflicts between their proto-Christian life and their mostly pagan education.</p>
<p>The bishops&#8217; homilies continuously spoke against the duality magic for more than seven centuries until the Council in Trullo (691-692AC), gaining ground slowly but steadily.<sup>2</sup> At a first glance <strong>the Dyonisian engravings</strong> on the Dumbarton Oaks silver bowl seem to support the the thesis of a ritual use. Yet, numerous elements support the bowl’s ornamental value.</p>
<p>The <strong>imagery honored the Dionysian festivals</strong>, traditionally associated with the immutable spring revival and a trade facilitating change in the Mediterranean winds. Presumably, the spring’s increased food stability encouraged the Byzantines to overlook the patristic fathers’ vehement condemnation of banquets.<sup>3</sup>, and maintain the Greek festivals’ social traditions of food distribution accompanied by music, dance and theatrical performances.<sup>4,5</sup></p>
<p>Technically, the <strong>repoussé and chasing</strong> require thin walls, creating fragile objects. Indeed, the bowl’s lower register is damaged, preserving only few fragments of panthers and leaves. Lacking a double wall, the bowl presumably held grapes, and enhanced the owner’s financial security.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Given the <strong>gold coinage</strong> stability during the early Byzantine Empire, the elites also acquired <strong>silver objects</strong> to display, or to melt if needed.<sup>7,8</sup></p>
<p>The well-crafted main <strong>register showcases Dionysos’ biography</strong> from his youth to his marriage, and his old age spent in the arms of Ariadne, his wife. The theme of Dionysos’ spiritual evolution betrays a Christian influence.<sup>9</sup> The Dionysian procession is altered; gone are the Hellenistic satyrs, masks, flutes, and tambourines.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The <strong>female figures</strong> are depicted dancing, reclining partially nude, and serving wine. Horse-pulled chariots and panthers bring in the <strong>partygoers.</strong> Undeniably, the decoration visually integrates the mythological Dionysian theme with the Byzantine festivities, replacing the <strong>nymphs, and ecstatic maenads</strong> with banquet or triumph revelers.</p>
<p>The association of <strong>dance</strong> with intimacy reinforces the Christian prejudice against non-gendered spaces and stigmatizes artists as sexually available.<sup>13</sup> The tension between Hellenistic and self-controlled Christian ideals also emerges in the stumbling Hercules and the dancing man holding grapes.<sup>14</sup> Resembling a drunk Silenus, the young dancer advances towards Dionysus. His torso twisted in a feminine Salome-like pose suggests an erotic play.</p>

<p>Metaphorically, the bowl exposes the banquets’ ability to efface the emerging Christian conventions and blur the gender boundaries. The profane reality of the Byzantine life, whose abundant manifestations could not easily disappear thwarted for centuries the imperial Christianization plans ultimately spawning a Christian society deeply rooted in the classical culture.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-645" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="555" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Art-Title-Page.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Growing Interest in Reality”</strong></h3>
<p>The Florentines began to pursue art forms that rendered the world around themselves more realistically. Bodies begin to return to mass-like forms, drapery fell naturally, and an elegant and decorative style developed. They rejected the popular trend of the Late Gothic.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1250-1400)</strong></h5>
<p>There are two opposing art movements in the 14<sup>th</sup> century:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late Gothic / International Gothic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Gothic style was very popular throughout Europe. It symbolized craftsmanship and decorative design. Figures were rendered with elongation and delicacy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proto-Renaissance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Regions like Florence, Pisa, and Siena began to investigate art and use it as a medium to display important ideas or messages. During the Middle Ages, Italian city-states became wealthy as banking and trade became dominant interests in the Mediterranean world. Humanism developed. An investigation of the classical past and the study the accomplishments of humans became a central concern.</p>
<h5><strong>Guilds</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-646" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=990%2C317&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=1024%2C328&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=1536%2C492&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Artists worked in <strong>guilds</strong> which were similar to unions. This worked organize apprenticeships, help artists, set prices, provide materials, and regulate commissions. This created artistic workshops which were free to join. The members were predominantly male, and it was rare to have females.</p>
<p>This existed until free markets of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Late Gothic sculpture</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Biblical<br />
Death<br />
Religion<br />
Devotional object<br />
Stylized bodies<br />
Male/female relationships</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Bonn, Germany</p>
<p><strong>Röttgen Pietà </strong>is a small painted wood sculpture measuring <strong>34 inches tall. </strong>It retains its original paint,  with browns, reds, and golds.</p>
<p>The  dark colors emphasize the physicality of the body, which is depicted as both limp, but rigid in pain. This late Gothic style is more able to capture this feeling, while retaining the features of delicate elongation from Early Gothic. The Crown of Thorns, wiry body and crumpled fabric creates.</p>
<h5><strong>Creating an Emotional Response</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The goal of <strong>late Gothic sculpture</strong> was to create an emotional response in the viewer. Churchgoers were confronted with agony, death, and sorrow. This was very different from the  jubilant images of Christ that they normally saw in early Gothic art.</p>
<p><strong>Andachtsbild</strong> (end-ACHT-speeld) is the German word for devotional image. It puts human pain in perspective and reminds us of Christ’s sacrifice and Mary’s great suffering. Religious figures are therefore humanized.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Röttgen Pietà</strong></h5>
<p>The Virgin cradles Christ after he has been removed from the cross. Christ is emaciated, through living an ascetic life of deprivation to achieve greater spirituality. He is drained of blood and stiff in rigor mortis.</p>
<p>The horror of the Crucifixion is evident. <strong>Stigmata </strong>is visible on his hands and feet. The Crown of Thorns has caused his face to bleed. Mary’s face is twisted in anger, confusion,  and anguish, as tears roll down her face.</p>
<h5><strong>A New Christ</strong></h5>
<p>The is an early, medieval representations of Christ that is focused on his divinity. Prior  to this Christ was depicted on the cross but did not suffer. Eventually, by the late middle ages or late Gothic era, this new focus on a suffering Christ emerged.</p>
<h5><strong>Art Reflecting Life</strong></h5>
<p>Suffering was part of the 14<sup>th</sup> century. It was a difficult time with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundred Years War</li>
<li>Plague</li>
<li>Famine</li>
</ul>
<p>Artwork suddenly took on <strong>a tragic tone</strong>.  Fearful churchgoers sought comfort and reassurance in the idea that Christ and Mary understood their suffering and the woes of humankind.  Scenes of the Pieta and Mary’s suffering became very common.</p>
<p>This led to a period of worship called Marian Devotion. Mary was seen as an accessible, warm, motherly intercessor who could advocate for humankind through Christ.</p>
<h5><strong>Gothic Goes International</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Late Gothic Era</strong> was so popular across Europe that it is known as International Gothic. This German work illustrates just that.</p>

<p>This Gothic style of text was popular across Europe. It included the elongation of thin, delicate figures, lack of logical space, and Gothic decorative architectural elements.  Gold-leaf backgrounds were often frequently used.</p>
<p>The word <strong>haggadah means narration in Hebrew.</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong>, this <strong>illuminated manuscript, using pigment on vellum</strong>, the scribe was Jewish and someone who knew how to write in <strong>Hebrew</strong>. It is written from right to left. Some pages have just text. Other pages have miniatures that were<strong> illustrated.</strong> There are 56 of these in total.</p>
<p>The artist was Christian and someone who knew the style of Christian illuminated manuscripts. It contains anachronistic styles of clothing and homes that does not match the historical information of the Biblical era.</p>
<p>This is one of the most luxurious examples of a <strong>Haggadah</strong> ever created. The gold illumination led to the name <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of the <em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong></h5>
<p>The pages contain the narrative Passover that include a celebration meal called a <strong>Seder</strong>. It was made for a wealthy Jewish family in Barcelona. This was one way of displaying the status and wealth of the owners.</p>
<p>Books were incredibly expensive to make at that time. The <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong> was even more so with its extensive use of extra gold illumination. Therefore, it was more ceremonial in nature, than a book to read. It is still in excellent condition.</p>
<h5><strong>Inside the Book</strong></h5>
<p>Haggadahs include prayers and readings said during the Seder, along with images to help contribute to the storyline.</p>

<p>At the top right, Miriam, the sister of Moses, and her maidens dance and play musical instruments. The instruments have Islamic motifs on them.  At the top left, the master of the house, sitting under a canopy, orders the distribution of matzoh and haroset to the children.</p>
<p>At the bottom right, the house is cleaned for Passover and leavened bread is removed. At the bottom left, sheep are slaughtered.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of Passover</strong></h5>
<p>This is the story of a miraculous salvation from slavery. It is tradition to recount it annually at Passover <strong>Seder</strong>. The evening begins, when a child at the table asks, “Why is this night different from all other nights?” This sets up the ritual narration of the story of Passover, when Moses led the Jews from slavery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moses tries to ask Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go,</li>
<li>Pharaoh says no.</li>
<li> God works through Moses to deliver ten plagues to Pharaoh, each one worse and worse, to force Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go.</li>
<li>Finally, the greatest plague God could send was the death of all first-borns, to protect Hebrew families.</li>
<li>God instructs Hebrews to mark their doors with animal blood so that the Angel of Death will <strong><em>pass over</em></strong> those homes.</li>
<li>Pharaoh’s oldest child, his son and heir to the throne dies.</li>
<li>Pharaoh is devastated and agrees that God must be who he says he is.</li>
<li>Pharoah lets the Hebrews go.</li>
<li>Moses tries to lead the Hebrews to the promised land.</li>
<li>Pharaoh regrets this and sends his army after them.</li>
<li>To allow the Hebrews to escape, Moses parts the Red Sea.</li>
<li>When the soldiers arrive, Moses lets the sea go. It washes away all the soldiers.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story of the</strong> <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong>Although the 2<sup>nd</sup> commandment in Judaism forbids the making of graven images, the haggadah were exempt from this rule. This was because they were seen as educational and not just decorative.</p>
<p>This is an example of <strong>cross-cultural</strong> borrowing in medieval Spain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian illuminated manuscript format appropriated by Jews.</li>
<li>Jewish text</li>
<li>Spanish artist</li>
<li>Spanish Jewish family</li>
<li>Islamic musical instruments</li>
</ul>
<p>Wealthy Jewish families often worked as advisers, physicians, and financiers so they were exposed to Christian court styles.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations of the Proto-Renaissance</strong></h5>
<p>Artists became important social figures. These artists still worked in guilds. They made contracts with patrons, but now they began to sign their works. This indicated the growing importance and risning status of the artist.</p>
<p>In <strong>architecture</strong>, height and width were stressed. In churches, there wide naves, rib vaults and clerestories.</p>
<p><strong>Painting</strong> included different styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Florentine: </strong>large-scale panels; fresco and tempera; achieve 3D reality; Cimabue + <em>maniera greca</em>; Giotto moves towards substantiated reality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sienese: </strong>decorative with rich colors; thin, elegant, courtly figures; figures are well proportioned; deep recessions into space.</li>
<li><strong>International Gothic style</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Sculpture</strong> was influenced by classical models, realistic masses and draperies,  horror vacuii and cluttered compositions.</p>

<p>The architect of the Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel in Padua, Italy is unknown. <strong>Artist Giotto di Bondone,</strong> designed the interior space so complementary to the exterior, that many believe he may have also been the architect of the <strong>42 feet tall structure.</strong></p>
<p>Unadorned, and <strong>made of brick</strong> on the exterior, and vastly decorative on the inside, it utilizes the old Christian symbolism of beautiful interior (soul) and austere exterior (body).</p>
<p>The simple basilica planned as an AKA rectangular barrel-vaulted hall.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting Frescoes</strong></h5>
<p>A<strong> buon fresco</strong>, or a wet or true fresco, starts with an application of wet plaster onto a wall. The wet plaster is then painted with <strong>tempera</strong> paint, made with egg yolk and pigment. This method  enables the paint to soak into the plaster, rather than just painting it and letting it dry on top of the wall. This makes the work durable, but speed is important.</p>
<p><strong>Giornata</strong>, in Italian is an art term meaning “a day’s work”. When creating a buon fresco, an artist must complete it in a day. When it dries the paint changes color, and it is impossible to remix the paint to match exactly.</p>

<figure id="attachment_441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-441" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-441" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Arena-Inside-Chapel.jpg?resize=500%2C634&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="634" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Arena-Inside-Chapel.jpg?w=246&amp;ssl=1 246w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Arena-Inside-Chapel.jpg?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-441" class="wp-caption-text">Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The figures in Giotto’s frescoes are painted in <strong>sculpturesque style</strong>. They are weighty, full-bodied figures, with a convincing spatial depth. The bodies are rounded and naturally make shadows through modeling.</p>
<p>The figures also exhibit a foreshortening, by turning parallel to the picture plane and receding back.  The composition is simple using a shallow stage.</p>
<p>Blue paint is used on the ceiling and in every panel to create visual unity. It is doted with gold stars, as if the viewer is looking into Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was the Chapel Built?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel</strong> was built for Enrico Scrovegni, from a prominent banking family. He wanted to atone for his sins of charging interest on a loan or the act of usury. Dante, in his novel, <em>Divine Comedy</em> even singles out the Scrovegni family for this sin.</p>
<p>It was named Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel, because it was right by an old Roman area, which was part of the Scrovegni estate.  This kind of art was known as good work to help the patron earn his way into  heaven.  Enrico Scrovegni himself appears in the Last Judgement fresco on the side of the blessed.</p>
<p>The chapel was intended for the private use of the Scrovegni family. It was a sign of great wealth to be able to build such a place.</p>
<h5><strong>Frescos Inside the Church </strong></h5>
<p>There are three registers of paintings, in reference to the Trinity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top level: life of Mary starts with her parents Joachim and Anna.</li>
<li>Middle level: Life of Jesus (Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Flight to Egypt)</li>
<li>Lower level (closest to churchgoers): Passion of Christ (return to Jerusalem à Resurrection)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The altar wall: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annunciation at the entrance</li>
<li>Last Judgment at the exit</li>
</ul>

<figure id="attachment_442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-442" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-442" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=700%2C550&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="550" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-442" class="wp-caption-text">Lamentation<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><em>Lamentation</em></strong> is the scene when Christ has been taken down from the cross, with followers around him mourning him. It is a group scene of the event, unlike the Pieta, which was just Mary and Christ. A range of emotions are displayed: sadness, resignation, outbursts, and despair.</p>
<p>Here, Mary holds Christ in a manner similar to other Mary and Christ Child scenes or Nativity scenes. She raises her right knee to prop Christ up. She puts her arm around him and leans towards him.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-651 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Jesus.jpg?resize=300%2C245&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="245" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Jesus.jpg?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Jesus.jpg?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The diagonal cliff formation points the eye to the main action placed in the lower-left hand corner. Christ is no longer center, no longer heraldic, no longer hierarchical. This is a departure from Medieval tradition.</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene sits at Christ’s feet, and her long, red curly hair, references how she had earlier cleaned Christ’s feet, with oil and her hair. John the Evangelist stands behind her. He is the youngest disciple and always depicted beardless.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-652 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?resize=300%2C237&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="237" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?resize=300%2C237&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?resize=768%2C606&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?w=907&amp;ssl=1 907w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The angels are in grief, pulling on their hair. While the figures at the back encircle the action. They do not provide information to the narrative but are a visual to the entrance of the painting.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Typology?</strong></h5>
<p>Typology is the study and interpretation of stories and symbols in the Bible, especially the relationship between  the Old and New Testaments. Here is how this is used in <em>Lamentation</em>.</p>
<p>The land is baren except for a single dead tree. This is the Tree of Life, which withered at the fall of Adam.  Christ is often thought of as the second Adam. This also gives reference to Winter and Christ’s death, before Spring and the eventual resolution.</p>
<p>In the quatrefoil to the left, Jonah is being swallowed by a whale, from the Old Testament story.  Jonah is often seen as a typological precursor to Christ.  He suffered a “death” in the belly of the whale for three days. Then he was spit out. This was seen as a resurrection.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Giotto di Bondone (1276- 1377)</strong> is considered the first artist of the Renaissance because he departs from the Gothic style and begins to place three-dimensional solid figures in a real and logical space. Art historians speculate that he was trained by Florentine painter, Cimabue, because their styles were so similar.</p>
<p>Born just outside of Florence, he would paint chapels in not only Florence, but Assisi, Rome, Padua, and Naples. He is regarded as the most important Italian painter in the 14<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ISLAMIC ART</h2>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-778" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C557&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="557" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h3>
<h3>Theme: “Divinity, infinity, and unity”</h3>
<p><strong>Islamic art</strong> is inspired by and entirely comprised of Islamic religious messages and content (divine). Additionally, much Islamic artwork is created not only to last forever but uses calligraphic script which relays the word of God – which is infinite – to the umma (Muslims). Lastly, Muslims believed there was unity in ordered and geometric multiplicity. Therefore, works of Islamic art are comprised of multiple parts and many different patterns and forms that are visually unified to create an entire composition.</p>
<p>Islamic art is not specific to a time, place, region or medium. It also spans an incredible 1400 years! It is inspired by many sources including:<br />
<strong>Roman</strong><br />
<strong>Early Christian</strong><br />
<strong>Byzantine</strong><br />
<strong>Sassanian art of pre-Islamic Persia</strong><br />
<strong>Central Asia and China</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-779" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Map.jpg?resize=800%2C527&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="527" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Map.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Map.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Key Terms</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Qur’an</strong>: The central religious text of Islam (Also written as Quran or Koran)</p>
<p><strong>Idolatry:</strong> The worship of idols.</p>
<p><strong>Monotheistic:</strong> Believing in a single god, deity, spirit</p>
<h5><strong>The Faith</strong></h5>
<p>Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet of God. An adherent of Islam is called a Muslim.</p>
<p>There are two denominations: the Sunni, which make up 75 to 90 per cent and the Shia which make up 10 to 20 percent.</p>
<p><strong>There are five pillars of Islam, which are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Shahadah (belief or confession of faith)</li>
<li>Salat (worship in the form of prayer)</li>
<li>Sawm Ramadan (fasting during the month of Ramadan)</li>
<li>Zakat (alms or charitable giving)</li>
<li>Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime)</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Historical Context 622-1600</strong></h5>
<p>The Muslim religion is one of five major religions in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad receives revelations from Angel Gabriel and God</li>
<li>He dies in 632. Muslims divided over succession issues (Sunni and Shi’a)</li>
<li>Umayyads (661-750)</li>
<li>Expand into North Africa and Iberia</li>
<li>Abbasids (750-1258) <strong>The Golden Age: mathematics, astronomy, medicine, natural sciences</strong></li>
<li>Mongols: Muslim world now <strong>divided between East</strong> (South and Central Asia, Iran) <strong>and West</strong> (Arabia, North Africa, Iberia)</li>
<li>Ottomans Capture Constantinople in 1453 with rapid expansion of religion and empire: <strong>theocracy</strong></li>
<li>Egalitarian religion that immediately dominates region and overcomes rivals</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Early Islamic Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Umayyad caliphate Period (661–750) </strong></h5>
<p>This is the formative period in Islamic art. The <strong>religious monuments</strong> erected under their patronage demonstrate an amalgam of Greco-Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian elements (decorative themes and motifs) while having an Islamic function and meaning.</p>
<p>The development of Islamic architecture were the requirements of the new religion. Customs necessitated a different usage of space. A royal ideology involved creating monuments which reflected their power and authority. The monuments were often constructed on sites of historical or symbolic significance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-792" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> in Jerusalem (691), the first major Umayyad architectural undertaking was built on a prominent site formerly occupied by Solomon’s Temple</li>
<li>the <strong>Great Mosques of Damascus</strong> (706) was the site of the former Roman temple and a fourth-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art in the Medieval Period (c. 900-1517 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>The Art of the Abbasid Period (750–1258)</strong></h5>
<p>They conquered the Umayyads (661–750) in 750, shifting the focal point of Islamic political and cultural life eastward from Syria to Iraq. <strong>Baghdad</strong> became the new Abbasid capital.</p>
<p>Today, virtually nothing remains from Abbasid Baghdad, so the nearby Samarra is used to understand the Abbasid art and architecture innovations.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way of carving surfaces, the so-called <strong>beveled style</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>arabesque</strong>: a repetition of abstract geometric or pseudo-vegetal forms which was widely used as wall decoration and popular in other media -wood, metalwork, pottery</li>
<li>an extensive use of <strong>color</strong> in decoration</li>
<li>possibly, the introduction of the <strong>technique of luster painting</strong> over a white glaze producing a glittering effect reminiscent of precious metal</li>
</ul>
<p>By the 10th century, the Muslim world was fragmented, and individual dynasties sprang up.</p>
<p>These dynasties had varying degrees of control over different parts of the lands where Islam was the dominant or a major religion. It was also the time of the European Christian crusades, which aimed to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims.</p>
<ul>
<li>In North Africa and the Near East, the <strong>Fatimids (909-1171)</strong>, emerged and ruled an area that includes present-day Egypt, Sicily, Algeria, Tunisia, and parts of Syria.</li>
<li>The major <strong>Turkic dynasties and people from Central Asia came</strong> to the forefront of Islamic politics and artistic creativity</li>
<li>The <strong>Seljuqs, Central Asian</strong> nomads eventually controlled Iran, Iraq and much of Anatolia</li>
<li>The <strong>Mamluks</strong>, the slave soldiers (mamluk, literally meaning “owned,”) controlled Syria and Egypt until 1517.</li>
<li>The invading <strong>Mongols</strong> and their great leader, <strong>Genghis Khan (c. 1162-1227)</strong>, Pax Mongolica</li>
<li>Blood-thirsty conquest and destruction of the Islamic world; established their rule over most Asia.</li>
<li>The <strong>West Asia</strong> (Iraq, Iran, Khorasan, Caucasus, and parts of Asia Minor) formed the “Il-Khanat,”lesser Khanat”</li>
<li>His legacy included the Pax Mongolica, the reconnection of the East and West (1279-1368), via the re-opened Silk Roads</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Seljuq Turks</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Nomadic Turkish warriors from Central Asia, established in the Middle East in 11th century</li>
<li>1055 founded the great Seljuk Sultanate (Turko-Persian Sunni) over Iran, Iraq, Syria</li>
<li>The dynasty brought revival, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians and acted as a buffer between Sunni, Shi’a, Christians, Mongols</li>
<li>Prevented the Fatimids of Egypt from spreading Shiite Islam</li>
<li>Created a barrier to Europe against the Mongol invaders</li>
<li>1071 at Manzikert they defeated the Byzantines conquering Anatolia; blocked inland expansion by the crusader states on the Syrian Coast in 12th century</li>
<li>Seljuk Turks are regarded as the ancestors of the inhabitants of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan.</li>
<li>Founded universities, patrons of art, literature; Persian astronomers, poets Omar Khayyám.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Ilkhanid Period (1256–1353)</strong></h5>
<p>In a short period of time, the Mongol control of most of Asia led to the so-called the Pax Mongolica, which reopened the <strong>Silk Road</strong> and created an environment of tremendous cultural exchange. <strong>East Asian elements are absorbed into the existing Perso-Islamic traditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decorative arts:</strong> textiles, metalwork, ivory-carving, ceramics furnished mosques, palaces</li>
<li>Major focus on <strong>illuminated and illustrated manuscripts</strong> (religious and secular)</li>
<li>An initial dynamic, almost dramatic phase followed by a more refined style</li>
<li>Great artistic development in manuscripts, such as those that recounted the Shahnama (or Book of Kings), the famous Persian epic</li>
<li><strong>Metalworkers </strong>created ewers, basins, cases in bronze/brass engraved, inlaid with silver</li>
<li>Also, great builders: mosques and Sufi shrines across Iran: Isfahan, Tabriz, and Yazd</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ilkhanid dynasty disintegrated in 1335 and local dynasties came to power in Iraq, Iran.</p>
<h5><strong>The Timurids (c. 1370-1507)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Timur (also known as Tamerlane)</strong>, who conquered and controlled all Central Asia, greater Iran, and Iraq, as well as parts of southern Russia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>The Timurids were outstanding builders of monumental architecture. Herat, in present-day Afghanistan, became the capital and cultural center of the Timurid empire.</p>
<h5><strong>The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1469) </strong></h5>
<p><strong>The medieval era of European al-Andalus</strong></p>
<p>When the Umayyad caliphate of Damascus was overthrown by the Abbasids in 750, the <strong>last surviving member of the Umayyad dynasty fled to Spain initiating the Umayyad emirate (756–929).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abd al-Rahman I (r. 756–88)</strong> made <strong>Córdoba </strong>his capital and unified al-Andalus under his rule with a firm hand, while establishing diplomatic ties with the northern Christian kingdoms, North Africa, and the Byzantine empire and maintaining cultural contact with the ‘Abbasids in Baghdad. Despite their open rejection of Abbasid political authority, the Umayyads of Córdoba emulated the opulent palatial arts of the centers of Abbasid power, Baghdad, and Samarra.</p>
<p><strong>The Almoravids (1062–1150), The Almohads (1150–1269), The Nasrids (1232-1492)</strong> of the southern Iberian Peninsula and western North Africa.</p>

<li>Despite its precarious political situation, for over two and a half centuries Granada were the patrons of Islamic art in the Muslim West, attracting leading scholars and literati.</li>
<li><strong>Córdoba:</strong> the greatest intellectual center of Europe, with celebrated libraries and schools.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art Later Period (c. 1517 –1924 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>This period is the era of the last great Islamic Empires.</p>
<h5><strong>The Ottoman Empire 1281-WW1</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Started in 14th century as a small Turkic state in Anatolia</li>
<li>Emerged in the second half of the fifteenth century as a major military and political force.</li>
<li>the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453 and the Mamluk Empire in 1517.</li>
<li>Dominated much of Anatolia, the Balkans, the Near East, and North Africa until after WWI</li>
<li>Best known for mosques in the late 15<sup>th</sup> and early 16<sup>th</sup> century</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Safavids 1501–1722</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the greatest dynasty of Iran</li>
<li>Established Shia Islam as the dominant faith of Iran</li>
<li>Arts: architecture, painting, manuscripts, and carpets all flourished under the Safavids.</li>
<li>the Safavids most outstanding ruler, Shah Abbas (r. 1587–1629)- greatest patron of the arts</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Mughals. 1526–1858</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Founded by Babur</li>
<li>Ruled over the largest Islamic state in the Indian subcontinent.</li>
<li>conquered the earlier sultanates of today northern Indian and Pakistan</li>
<li>Patrons of some of the greatest works of Islamic art: illuminated manuscripts and painting, and architecture, including the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>patrons</strong> of this time were the rulers and elite. These works were both refined and decorative, reflecting order. No religious figures were shown at this time.</p>
<p>Painting and sculpture used <strong>arabesque</strong> or “Arab-like” flowing, intricate, repetitive pattern derived from stylized organic motifs, usually floral. <strong>Examples include acanthus leaves, vines, and spirals.</strong> It is a French word that was derived from the Italian word Arabesco, which simply means Arabic style.</p>
<p><strong>Tessellations </strong>is the repetition of geometric designs.</p>
<p><strong>Calligraphy</strong> was considered the highest art form. It transmits the word of God to Muhammad. These were the most respected artists. Yet, most artists remained anonymous. It wasn’t until only later calligraphers would sign their works.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Islamic architecture has a wide scope from both secular to religious styles.</p>
<p><strong>Mosque: </strong>A place of worship for Muslims, like a Christian church or Jewish synagogue. A mosque will often have at least one <strong>minaret</strong>. In Arabic the word mosque is <strong>masjid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minaret: </strong>The tall slender tower of an Islamic mosque, from which the <strong>muezzin </strong>(the man who calls Muslims to pray) recites the adhan call to prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Mihrab: </strong>A semicircular niche in the wall of a mosque, that indicates the <strong>qibla</strong> (direction of Mecca), and into which the <strong>imam </strong>(man who leads prayer) prays.</p>
<p><strong>Hypostyle halls</strong> or unified open interiors were a popular type of mosque structure.</p>
<h5><strong>Early Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>Recognized immediately as Islamic architecture, the building of Mosques began after Muhammad’s time. It incorporated traditional Roman building traditions, along with the local traditions of incorporating Sassanid and Byzantine models.</p>
<p>Historically, mosques have been used as both <strong>meeting places and a space to pray</strong>. Early mosques are said to be based on Muhammad’s home in Medina, which is officially the first mosque.</p>
<p>One of the best preserved and earliest mosques is the <strong>Great Mosque of Kairouan</strong>, in Tunisia. Dating back to 670 CE, it contains architectural features that distinguish <strong>early mosque styles</strong>. This includes <strong>a minaret, large courtyard, surrounded by porticos and a hypostyle prayer hall.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Ottoman Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>During the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> century <strong>Ottoman mosques</strong> were found in the cities of Bursa and Edirne. These were developed from earlier Seljuk Turk architecture, but were also influenced by Byzantine, Persian, and Islamic Mamluk.</p>
<p>This architecture was perfected in the 16<sup>th</sup> century with massive domes, and vast interiors, all of which appeared weightless. There were square dome plans, slender cornet minarets and columns. Think: <strong>The Blue Mosque</strong>, in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
<h5><strong>The Safavid Dynasty</strong></h5>
<p>During this time architecture flourished with large mosques, palaces such as Ali Qapu, numerous well-planned gardens, and an immense bazaar. Ishan, which was the capital of both the Safavid and the previous Seljuk dynasties saw the most growth.  Think: <strong>The Imperial Mosque </strong>built in 1598.</p>

<h5><strong>Other Forms of Art</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Textiles</li>
<li>Ceramics</li>
<li>Calligraphy</li>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Glass</li>
<li>Metalwork</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Textiles</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Textile arts </strong>falls under the category of arts and crafts. It uses plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to craft objects.  Working with textiles predates Islamic times and have also been of great importance to Middle Eastern cultures.</p>
<p>With the growth of Islamic dynasties textile development was controlled regionally. The most important textiles created were <strong>carpets.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Carpet Production During the Ottoman Empire </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>1299 CE Turkish tribes in northwestern Anatolia founded the Ottoman state</li>
<li>1453 tribes conquer Constantinople and establish the Ottoman Empire</li>
<li>The empire grows and stretches to include parts of Asia, Europe, and Africa</li>
<li>1922 monarchy was abolished in Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>Carpets were considered a <strong>decorative item</strong> during the Ottoman Empire. Not only were carpets placed on floors, but walls and even doors.  In addition to providing beauty, carpets helped to supply additional warmth and insolation when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Silk and cotton</strong> were the most common blend of fibers within the weave of Ottoman carpets. These works were rich in symbolism and religious meaning.</p>
<p>The most notable area for silk carpets was the town of Hereke. Artisans were known to create works of the very finest weaves that found homes in royal palaces.</p>
<h5><strong>Persian Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Iranian Safavid Empire (1501–1786)</strong> were strong contributors to textile arts. Starting as a craft among nomads and peasants it quickly grew into an area of expertise and carpets from this area were in demand internationally.</p>
<p>Some examples to note include:</p>
<p><strong>Anhalt Northwest Persian Medallion </strong>(Metropolitan Museum of Art)</p>
<p>This 16<sup>th</sup> century carpet is made from cotton and wool</p>

<p><strong>Tree Carpet</strong> (Philadelphia Museum of Art)</p>
<p>This carpet has been attributed to the 16<sup>th</sup>&#8211; 17<sup>th</sup> century timeframe. It is a highly regarded example of a Persian carpet from the classic era.  Notice there are six long cypress trees in blue and green.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Further in this lesson we will look add the <strong>Ardabil Carpets</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Indonesian Batiks</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Carpets were not the only form of textiles. <strong>Batiks from Indonesia</strong> were also prized. These are cloths that are printed with design. In the dying process, wax is placed on sections where the artist does not want the color to be absorbed.  The process takes multiple steps to process a variety of colors within one design.</p>
<p>The creation of batiks predates Islam. Yet batiks reached a peak when royal Muslim courts produced not only cloth but garments.</p>
<p>In Islamic fashion cloth was produced with abstract and intricate design and for the most part were <strong>aniconic</strong>. In rare cases human and animal depictions can be found.</p>
<p>The appearance of <strong>pre-Islamic mythology</strong> is common, however. These images include <strong>Garuda</strong>, the immortal bird-god, known for strength and ferocity and defeating oceans full of snakes. These <strong>serpents </strong>are also part of batiks, as are <strong>puppets</strong> shaped in human form.</p>
<p>Today batiks still maintain importance. These artistic works are hung, worn, and used for wrapping the Quran.</p>
<h5><strong>Ceramics</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ceramics </strong>are another notable artform within Islamic art. Wonderful examples are evident in both pottery and building tiles.  Early pottery was left unglazed.</p>
<p>The first examples are <strong>opaque glazes</strong> which date back to the <strong>8<sup>th</sup> century </strong>and emerged through the <strong>Hispano–Moresque style</strong> in Adaluz or Muslim Spain. This type of glaze was achieved through using an <strong>opaque white tin-glaze.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hispano–Moresque style </strong>also introduced the ceramic technique of <strong>painting in metallic lusters</strong>. This gave pottery pieces an iridescent glaze by using transparent or semi-transparent glaze that was activated by first heating and then cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Hispano-Moresque style</strong> continued to flourish under <strong>Christian</strong> rule when elements from both religions appeared together in ceramic works.</p>
<p>The 9<sup>th</sup> century brought with it works in <strong>stonepaste </strong>from Iraq as well as <strong>lusterware </strong>from Persia and Syria. The influence of <strong>Chinese ceramics</strong> on Islamic artists in apparent in shape, technique, and decoration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-829" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=446%2C446&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=1024%2C1021&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=768%2C766&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=270%2C270&amp;ssl=1 270w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Persian-Bowl-Luster_Glazed-StonePaste.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The ceramic piece (above) is entitled <strong>Bowl with Repeating Persian Inscription Wishing for Good Fortune</strong> is stonepaste with luster-painted on opaque white glaze. It dates from 1419-1420 CE and is attributed to Afghanistan or Iraq. On view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 455.</p>
<p>Ottoman Iznik produced excellent ceramic works in the 16th century. Influenced by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics artisans created tiles and vessels with floral cascades, human and animal forms.</p>

<h5><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h5>
<p>Work in <strong>calligraphy</strong>, the art of writing in decorative form, took on great importance. <strong>Kufic</strong> is the earliest form of Arabic calligraphy and is distinct for its <strong>angular form</strong>.</p>
<p>Quranic verse is not the only purpose. Calligraphy is also used to <strong>inscribe poetry</strong>, and to illustrate both <strong>ownership</strong> and generous donations.</p>
<p>Calligraphy is incorporated into <strong>books, art, architecture, coins</strong>,<strong> tiles</strong>, and <strong>metal work</strong>, in secular and non-secular forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Islamic painting in medieval times was dominated by two forms, <strong>book painting</strong> and <strong>miniatures.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Book Painting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Persia, Syria, Iraq</strong>, and the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> sparked a growth in the use of <strong>Islamic book painting</strong> during late medieval times.  During the Ilkhanid dynasty in Persia, examples of beauteous, large<strong>, illuminated manuscripts </strong>emerged.</p>
<p>During the 13<sup>th</sup> century <strong>manuscript paintings</strong> were influenced by the Byzantines and Mongols. Mongols was the generic term for a group of people comprised of both Mongolic and Turkic tribes of the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p><strong>Maquamat</strong>, the plural form of <strong>Maqāma</strong>, is an early medieval text and type of literary genre. It illustrated the day-to-day life of the people of the time. It contained prose that rhymed, with snippets of spiritual poetry.</p>
<h5><strong>Miniatures</strong></h5>
<p>Small paintings on paper, also known as <strong>miniatures, </strong>were an artistic tradition in <strong>Persia</strong>. The Mughals of India and Ottomans of Turkey also produced these artworks from which Persian artists were highly influenced.</p>
<p><strong>Mughal</strong> artists were known for their realistic portraits, many of which are in profile, while <strong>Ottoman </strong>artists used a more stylized form. Subjects included idealized youths, animals, family, and picnic scenes, as well as works focusing on individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts</strong> were part of the court and therefore had to pertain to all the religious rules governing the elimination of human depiction. While miniatures for a more general audience enabled human form.</p>
<p>Looking at miniature paintings during this time one can see the <strong>Byzantine influence</strong> visually. This includes work in blue and gold, as well as angelic motifs. <strong>Chinese influence</strong> is also apparent in the use of flowers such as peonies, as well as well as mythological creatures including phoenixes and dragons.</p>
<p><strong>Muraqqa </strong>is an album in book form combining Islamic <strong>miniature paintings</strong> and calligraphy from many different artists. The word Muraqqa is a Persian word that translates into “that which has been patched together”. Books of this type were popular among collectors in the Islamic world.</p>
<h5><strong>Glassmaking </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic glassmaking</strong> was considered <strong>a luxury art</strong> for the wealthy. During the Middle Ages, Islamic glass had a reputation for being the best in Eurasia and was shipped to buyers in both Europe and China. Some of the finest examples of glass from this time were found in <strong>lamps for mosques</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_831" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-831" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-831" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=401%2C535&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="401" height="535" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-831" class="wp-caption-text">Mosque Lamp</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Mosque Lamp</strong> (above) from the 14<sup>th</sup> century is attributed to Egypt and Syria. It is made from a colorless glass with a yellow tinge that was blown with an applied blown foot. It is both enameled and gilded. On view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 454.</p>
<p>During the 8<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> centuries glass was decorated with incised patterns or in relief, by cutting away sections of glass. <strong>Luster painting</strong>, which dates to 9<sup>th</sup> century Egypt was also popular. This was achieved with the application of metallic pigment during the glass making process. Sometimes threads of glass were created in different colored threads and then pulled into the main surface to be heated together. There are also examples of glass that has been <strong>gilded, painted, and enameled</strong>.</p>
<p>By the 1500s glassmaking expertise moved on to Venice, where many orders for mosque lamps were completed.</p>
<h5><strong>Islamic Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p>The inlay technique, where pieces of softer metals (such as <strong>copper, gold, and silver</strong>) were inlaid into harder metals (<strong>bronze or brass</strong>) were used, represents a high point in Islamic metalwork of the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Initially in the 12th century it was laborious. Imagine hammering wire into tiny grooves that were previously cut into the object. These were chiseled to about 1-mm deep recesses along the pattern lines. Later in the 14th century there was a shortage of silver, hammering the inlaid designs directly onto the roughened surface. This was more economical, but the inlays peeled off easily.</p>

<p><em> </em><strong>The Kaaba </strong>located in <strong>Mecca, Saudi Arabia</strong>, is the holiest shrine in Islam.</p>
<p>Made from <strong>granite masonry, </strong>it is covered with<strong> silk curtain </strong>and<strong> calligraphy in gold and silver-wrapped thread. </strong>The silk curtain also known as <strong>kiswa</strong>, is replaced annually during the hajj. The monument measures <strong>43 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kaaba</strong> is the Arabic word for <strong>cube or square building.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Renovations and Additions</strong></h5>
<p>The structure has been <strong>renovated multiple times</strong>, and so has the surrounding mosque. <strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been set on fire and survived floods.  The black stone has been broken and reassembled with silver. The last major modifications were carried out in the 1950s by the government of Saudi Arabia to accommodate the increasingly large number of pilgrims who come on the hajj. Today the mosque covers almost 40 acres.</p>
<p>The <strong>door</strong> made of <strong>solid gold</strong> was added in 1982.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, is a large open space with <strong>colonnades on four sides</strong> and <strong>seven minarets</strong>, the largest number of any mosque in the world. At the center of this large plaza sits <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as well as many other holy buildings and monuments.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This important structure orients all mosques in the world. EVERY mosque is faced towards <strong>The Kaaba</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Prayer </strong></h5>
<p>Muslims <strong>pray</strong> <strong>five times per day</strong>. This is one of the five pillars of the faith.  These prayers are directed toward <strong>Mecca</strong> and <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as they have been since 624 CE. All mosques are marked with a <strong>qibla</strong> to know in which direction they need to pray.</p>
<h5><strong>Pilgrimage</strong></h5>

<p>Pilgrimage to a holy site is a core principle of almost all faiths. All Muslims aspire to undertake the hajj, or the annual pilgrimage, to <strong>The Kaaba</strong> once in their lives. This is another fundamental principle of the faith.</p>
<p>Once in Mecca, pilgrims gather in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram around <strong>The Kaaba</strong>. They then walk around <strong>The Kaaba.</strong> The goal is to kiss and touch the <strong>Black Stone</strong>—al-Hajar al-Aswad—embedded in the eastern corner.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> is a square building with a small interior room. Placed on the corner is the <strong>Black Stone </strong>which is the only original piece that remains on the site.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>According to tradition, the first building was <strong>built by Old Testament figure Abraham (known as Ibrahim in Islamic) and his son. </strong>Abraham’s son with his servant Hagar was Ismail. It is believed to be a structure that Abraham and his son Ismail created. It was built close to where Hagar found water.</p>
<p>The original sanctuary was a simple roofed rectangular structure. It housed the <strong>Black Stone</strong> (given to Abraham by the angel Gabriel) and statues of pagan gods.</p>
<p>The site was a <strong>pre-Islamic</strong> pilgrimage run by the Qaresh tribe, to which Muhammad belonged.</p>
<p>It was rebuilt it in 608 CE with masonry and wood. A door was included above ground level to protect the interior from intruders and flood waters.</p>

<li><strong>634-644 CE:</strong> second caliph Umar expanded the area around <strong>The Kaaba</strong> to accommodate more pilgrims</li>
<li><strong>644-656:</strong> third caliph Uthman built colonnades around the plaza where <strong>The Kaaba</strong> stands</li>
<li><strong>683 CE:</strong> <strong>The Kaaba</strong> was set on fire during a civil war
<ul>
<li><strong>The Black Stone</strong> broke into three pieces and was reassembled with silver</li>
<li><strong>The Kaaba</strong> was rebuilt in wood and stone and the space around it was paved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>By end of 7<sup>th</sup> century</strong>, <strong>The Kaaba</strong> was covered with <strong>kiswa</strong> a black cloth that is replaced annually during hajj.</li>
<li><strong>705-715 CE</strong>: Umayyad caliph al-Walid decorated the mosque that encloses <strong>The Kaaba</strong> with mosaics</li>

<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> sits on the highest point of old <strong>Jerusalem, Palestine. </strong>It is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong> with a <strong>wooden roof</strong> decorated with <strong>glazed ceramic tile, mosaics</strong>, and <strong>gilt aluminum</strong> and <strong>bronze dome</strong>. The dome measures <strong>67 feet</strong> on each side, plus 67 feet for the width of dome, and the same measurement for the height of drum.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-794" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-and-Exterior-Drwaing.jpg?resize=500%2C461&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The domed wooden octagonal building is <strong>centrally planned </strong>with <strong>two</strong> <strong>ambulatories</strong> that encircle the stone in the middle. The <strong>first ambulatory</strong> has 16 columns in its arcade. The <strong>second ambulatory</strong> has 24 columns in its arcade. This area is decorated with mosaic inscriptions from the Quran.</p>
<p>Notice in the arcade that the voussoirs are alternating colors. This is typical for Islam.</p>

<h5><strong>Entering Paradise</strong></h5>
<p>In Islam, there are <strong>8 levels of Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>8 x 2 = 16</p>
<p>8 x 3 = 24</p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Influences</strong></h5>
<p>At the time Islam was a very new religion and determined its artist influences cross culturally.</p>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock was </strong>Influenced by <strong>Byzantine</strong> centrally planned buildings like San Vitale. They also borrowed the Byzantine tradition of <strong>mosaic work</strong>.  Mosaics on this building use <strong>tessellation</strong> or polygonal shapes that repeat without gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Roman influence</strong> can be seen in <strong>mausolea</strong>, (burial places for Roman emperors were circular) and the <strong>Roman dome</strong> (Pantheon). They were also Influenced by <strong>columns</strong> taken from Roman monuments (<strong>spolia</strong>) and the <strong>arcade</strong>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Coptic</strong> traditions of present-day Egypt and Syria, include its geometric motifs. <strong>Sassanian</strong> metal work was borrowed from what is present day Iran.</p>
<h5><strong>Pure Geometry</strong></h5>

<p>All decoration is <strong>aniconic</strong> meaning it is nonrepresentational and purely geometric . Here is why.</p>
<p>Muslims believed that <strong>mathematics</strong> was an indication that God controlled and had created the entire universe. <strong>Tessellations </strong>and mathematical designs help to reinforce this idea.</p>
<p>Muslims took the second commandment very strictly. It reads, “Thou shalt have no graven images”.  This was interpreted by Muslims as meaning there should not be anything representational in any religious art whatsoever</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Original function still debated – but it is a shrine, NOT a mosque</li>
<li>Symbol of caliphate strength</li>
<li>Testament to the power of the new Islamic faith</li>
<li>Pilgrimage site: Muslim pilgrims circumambulate the rock at the center of the building</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> is the earliest surviving Islamic building. It was created during the Umayyad period and the 1<sup>st</sup> caliphate of Islam.</p>
<p>It was built under the patronage of Abd al-Malik, who was the most important Umayyad caliph,  in the midst of a civil war</p>
<p>Whether there was a Byzantine church on this site, or near it, is still debated. Yet the Byzantine church style was still a huge influence on this building.</p>

<p>The <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba</strong>, stands in<strong> Córdoba, Spain. </strong>This magnificent architectural structure is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong>.</p>
<p>It was built here for the practical reason. The land was already available and flat. The site was recognized as an important structure. An entire town was built around it. The work was used to show religious and cultural supremacy over the Romans.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/56-Great-Mosque-Plan.gif?resize=490%2C700&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="490" height="700" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The floor plan is the one of three kinds for mosques: <strong>Hypostyle Hall</strong>, Four-Iwan, Central Plan.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-799" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?resize=990%2C604&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="604" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The main building is comprised of the <strong>hypostyle hall. </strong>Through the use of repeated geometry, the hall seems larger than it is.  There are 514 <strong>double-horseshoe-arch</strong> columns, with alternating red and white <strong>voussoirs. </strong>Columns are Roman <strong>spolia</strong> from the temple here. Horseshoe arches are common feature of Visogoth Spanish architecture, which was then adopted by Muslims in Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Qiblah wall</strong> and <strong>mihrab</strong> are designated on the back wall. <strong>Mihrabs</strong> typically face Mecca and the Kaba which is what Muslims must specifically direct their prayers towards. However, this mosque does not face Mecca. It seems to be a mistake on the original understanding of geography by the Muslims who built it. In addition, it was originally a church and Muslims were not able to change the foundation to reorient the mosque towards Mecca.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba </strong>is a place for worship, prayer and contemplation. Hypostyle hall mosque encourages the viewer to contemplate the space and to seek out the qiblah wall which contains the mihrab. Here they must direct prayer.  to the mihrab</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the</strong> <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba.</strong></h5>
<p>The courtyard contained a fountain, a covered walkway encircling the courtyard, a minaret, and an orange grove. Oranges were symbols of Cordobans.</p>
<p><strong>Qiblah wall</strong> is the wall that people must find. because it points towards the Kaaba in Mecca.  It also contains the <strong>mihrab.</strong> This is an empty arch on the qiblah wall. Mosque-goers pray towards this, not this. It is an empty arch because there can be no images of religious figures represented in Muslim religion.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>This is an example of<strong> Moorish</strong> culture. Muslims once ruled over Spain, or <strong>Al-Andalus</strong> as it was called in Arabic. <strong>Cordoban Caliphate </strong>began with exiles from the previous caliphate ,Umayyads. Established by Abd al-Rahman I, who ran away to Spain and established control over Iberia, he sponsored elaborate building programs. This became the center of a brilliant Golden Age for Isla.</p>
<p><strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba </strong>is one of the oldest structures still standing from when the Muslims ruled Al-Andalus.</p>
<p>There was originally a temple on the site to Janus, the Roman god of time, both past and future. It was converted into a church by Visogoths, in 572 CE.  Then, it was made into a mosque. Following this, it was totally rebuilt by the Cordoban Caliphate. Later, it was made into a Gothic church, with buttresses and pointed vaults added. A Renaissance style nave was eventually constructed.</p>
<p>Today, it is still a Catholic church.  Beginning in early 2000s, Muslims petitioned the Church to allow them to worship here and have since been consistently denied.</p>

<strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>in <strong>Isfahan, Iran,</strong> is made from <strong>stone, brick, wood, plaster</strong>, and <strong>glazed ceramic tile.</strong> It is positioned in the center of the old city. Since it was enlarged and added on to for many years, it shares walls with surrounding buildings and is an odd shape.</p>
<p>This is the second of <strong>three mosque styles</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hypostyle Hall</li>
<li><strong>Four-iwan</strong></li>
<li>central plan</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Four-iwan Mosque Style</strong></h5>
<p>This style of mosque, of which <strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>is a prime example, has a large courtyard with four open vaulted rooms or <strong>iwans</strong> open to the courtyard.  This courtyard contains water. On holy days, Muslims <strong>must wash their hands and feet before entering a mosque.</strong></p>
<p>The four <strong>iwans</strong> are framed by <strong>pishtaqs</strong>. These are rectangular frames around pointed arched openings. Iwans help to bring light and ventilation into what would otherwise be dark rooms.</p>
<h5><strong>The Color Blue</strong></h5>
<p>Use of <strong>blue colored tile</strong> in mosaic tessellations is very distinctive for <strong>Safavid</strong> architecture. It uses  aniconic imagery since this is a mosque. Notice the curving, decorative lines, or <strong>arabesques. </strong>These are used as a veneer over a brick core.</p>
<figure id="attachment_805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-805" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-805" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-86.-detaila.jpg?resize=512%2C770&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="512" height="770" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-805" class="wp-caption-text">Detail © EmmePi Travel/Alamy</figcaption></figure>
<h5><strong>The Ogival Arch</strong></h5>
<p>The architecture uses the <strong>pointed arch</strong>, an influence that comes from the Christian West. This arch is  often called an <strong>ogival arch</strong> since it pinches slightly at the top.</p>
<h5><strong>Qiblah Iwan</strong></h5>
<p>This is the location of the <strong>mihrab</strong>. It is the only one marked with two <strong>minarets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Muezzin</strong> will call people to prayer from the minarets</li>
<li>Reserved for use by rulers</li>
<li>Constructed in 1310 by Mongols (Ilkhanid) rulers</li>
<li>Can see the <strong>minbars</strong> (short flight of steps used as a platform by a preacher in a mosque)</li>
<li>Iwan is filled with <strong>muqarnas </strong>(3D triangle that curls out towards you; layered over one another to make the interior of an arch grow out <strong>towards you)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh)</strong> is a mosque for personal prayer, worship, and contemplation. It is also the center of community and a  way of bringing people together and facilitating community. The courtyard creates a tranquil space with water where the viewer can sit and relax.</p>
<p>The mosque was connected to several pedestrian walkways originally. This facilitated not only public mobility but also commercial activity in connection to the mosque, as it was located near a large market.</p>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Isfahan was the capital of the Seljuk Turk empire</li>
<li>The mosque was expanded upon for a period of 1,000 years (8<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries)</li>
<li>In 700 CE, it was just a small mosque with the courtyard</li>
<li>11<sup>th</sup> century: core structure of the 4-iwan model was added by Seljuk Turks (under the reign of Malik Shah I, ruled 1072-1092)</li>
<li>Later rulers constantly expanded it (Mongol period – Ilkhanid; Timurid; Safavid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mosque of Selim II</strong>, located in <strong>Edirne, Turkey</strong>, is a building made of <strong>brick and stone</strong>, with <strong>a dome measuring 31 meters across.  </strong>This mosque is designed in a <strong>Central Plan</strong>, which is one type of three mosque types. The other two types are Hypostyle Hall and Four-Iwan.</p>

<h5><strong>The Exterior</strong></h5>
<p>The exterior has elegantly stacked domes with towering minarets or <strong>pencil minarets</strong>. <strong>Muezzin</strong>, or person who will lead the prayer would call everyone to prayer from the minarets.</p>
<p>Here, a complex system of buttresses were used to hold up the massive weight of the dome. It is over 101 feet across, which is larger Hagia Sophia’s dome.</p>
<p>The building consists of 384 windows.</p>
<h5><strong>The Interior</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-498" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-498" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim-B.jpg?resize=500%2C733&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="733" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim-B.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim-B.jpg?resize=205%2C300&amp;ssl=1 205w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-498" class="wp-caption-text">Mosque of Selim II<br />© Vanni Archive/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The dome rests upon <strong>eight</strong> <strong>piers</strong>. The architect used <strong>squinches</strong> to transfer a circle into an octagon. There is <strong>Aniconic </strong>decoration with mosaic <strong>tessellation, </strong>or repetition of geometric design. The alternating red and white <strong>voussoirs </strong>are typical for Islamic architecture.</p>
<p>The <strong>mihrab</strong> is visible from almost any spot in the building even though it is not under the middle dome. It is pushed back into an apse-like alcove. Again, centrally planned spaces are symbolic and work nicely to unite people but are not actually designed to accommodate prayers or organized activities.</p>
<p>The <strong>muzzin</strong>, or prayer leader, had has platform under the center of the dome .</p>
<p>In this floor plan at  the front of the mosque sits a rectangular court, with an area equal to that of the mosque.</p>
<h5><strong>The Function</strong></h5>
<p>The mosque  is a place for prayer, contemplation, and community. Politically, mosques were a way for the Ottomans to show they had beat the Byzantine Empire.  It also symbolized Islam over Christianity.</p>
<p>The mosque’s design was based on Hagia Sophia. It was a statement of triumph to both the patron,  and the architect.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Patron and Location</strong></h5>
<p>Ottoman Sultan<strong> Selim II</strong>, the new Ottoman ruler, was the son of Son of Suleyman the Magnificent, who brought the Ottomans to the greatest territorial height. This mosque was built at the peak of Ottoman power in the Middle East.</p>
<p>When the rulers commissioned the work, he chose this spot specifically for the mosque. It was on the highest and would dominate the skyline.</p>
<p>Edirne, where the mosque is located, was the capital city of the Ottomans. It was the westernmost Ottoman city. For Europeans who may have encountered the city, it strategically made a good first impression.</p>
<p>This was the center of the community. The mosque had a school, or <strong>madrasas</strong> for studying Prophet Muhammad and his sayings. There was also a market, soup kitchen, bath, hospital, hospice, and cemetery.  The mosque was the meeting point to draw everyone together.</p>

<p><strong>Alhambra Palace</strong>, in <strong>Granada, Spain</strong>, is a <strong>whitewashed adobe</strong> made from <strong>stucco, wood, tile, paint and gilding</strong>. It is comprised of 1 mile of walls, 32 towers. It rests upon Sabika Hill, over 26 acres of land. This was a strategic vantage point for defense.</p>
<p>The exterior is plain and austere. There are many open passageways and courtyards, so sun and air could be freely admitted.</p>
<h5><strong>The Alcazaba and Royal Palace</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Alhambra Palace</strong> was originally an <strong>alcazaba </strong>or Islamic fortress for military purposes, with a citadel and barracks for elite guard. It was also a Royal Arab residence. This beautiful work of architecture was also propaganda to show off the power of the Nasrid kings.</p>
<p>It was a place to bring guests or ambassadors to show them the luxury and lavish life of the Nasrids. The elite enjoyed elaborate courtyards and gardens, which often included water. This created a sense of harmony and tranquility. Water is a major decorative element in Islam that promotes reflection, cooling, and peaceful qualities.</p>
<p>After the conquests of the Muslims in Spain, it was converted into a Christian Palace. Then, it was  converted into a Christian palace after the conquest of Muslims in Spain.</p>

<h5><strong>A Walk Through </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Alcazaba</strong> is the is the oldest part of the Alhambra. It was built by Mohammed I, who used it as his place of residence. Historians believe it was built over a Roman fortress. The rulers lived here until the rest of the palace was complete.</p>
<p>The Palace was organized around two central courtyards and included watch towers. It was highly decorated and made to feel like a “Paradise on Earth.”</p>

<p><strong>The Court of the Lions</strong>  is an oblong court that was surrounded by 124 slender columns. Each column connects to an arch that uses <strong>muqarnas. </strong>The columns and muqarnas arches were supposed to be reminiscent of palm trees that let light in but create patterns of shadow on the ground.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>lion fountain in the center</strong>, built and engineered by Muhammad V. It is supported by twelve lionesses. Each hour on the hours a lioness would produce water out of her mouth, as a representation of a clock keeping time.</p>
<p>The fountain utilized a complex hydraulics system, using two water channels that formed a cross in the center of the courtyard. The fountain apparently baffled all who saw it, even inspiring a poem on the fountain by Ibn Zamrak.</p>
<p>Although, not designed with anatomical accuracy, it was intended to show strength and power. Historians speculate that the four to the two water channels is associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The water flowing through suggests giving life. Although the twelve lions represent the 12 hours on a clock, they could also represent the 12 signs of the zodiac.</p>
<h5>SUB-IMAGE 2 (<strong>Hall of Two Sisters</strong>)</h5>

<p>This hall was in the center of a series of rooms where the sultana and her family lived. It had a highly sophisticated and refined interior.</p>
<p>The ceiling was made from 5000 muqarnas pieces reflecting light to create a delicate and open interior. It contained eight studded star shapes to represent the eight levels of paradise. There were 16 windows spread across two levels.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hall of Two Sisters</strong> was not named for siblings, rather it was named for two large twin marble flagstones that make up the floor.</p>

<ul>
<li>Built by the Nasrids, the final Islamic dynasty that controlled Al-Andalus</li>
<li>Nasrids gained control in 1237 and named their kingdom Granada</li>
<li>1492: Catholics Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada and made the Alhambra a Christian court</li>

<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in <strong>Agra, Uttar Pradesh, in Northern India</strong>, is an ancient <strong>Indian mausoleum</strong> representing exquisite <strong>Indo-Islamic architecture</strong> that measures <strong>240 feet</strong> across and sits on <strong>42 acres</strong>. The building is made with <strong>stone masonry</strong> and <strong>marble</strong>, along with <strong>an inlay of precious and semiprecious stones</strong>.</p>
<p>Masons, marble workers, mosaicists, and decorators worked under the supervision of <strong>Ustad Ahmad Lahori</strong>, architect of the emperor.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is not a singular marvel, rather it is a large complex, with the <strong>main tomb</strong> flanked by <strong>twin mosques</strong> that are identical in size. The complex also consists of a <strong>guest house</strong></p>
<p>There are also the grounds filled with impressive <strong>gardens</strong> called Chahar bagh, which used the Persian style.</p>
<p>A thoughtful blend of Persian, Turkic, and Indian styles, it is one of the finest instances of <strong>Mughal art and architecture.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>More About the Mungal Kingdom</strong></h5>
<p>The Mughal kingdom had expanded its Islamic rule over vast areas of northern and central India. Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces.</p>
<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the Taj Mahal is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Taj Mahal epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, <strong>bringing many Persian artists to India</strong>.</p>
<p>The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many <strong>Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists</strong> were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of <strong>miniature paintings</strong>. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing, and being influenced by indigenous Indian art.</p>
<p>Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.</p>
<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s</strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of Islamic and Indian architecture.  Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the Taj Mahal as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule.</p>
<p>Many <strong>motifs from Hindu culture</strong> had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style</strong>, some plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian.</p>
<h5><strong>Artists and Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Mughals were known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, it allowed for easy access to water. Moreover, Agra was known as a “riverfront” city</p>
<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent.</p>
<p>The <strong>five principal elements</strong> of the complex, which includes the <strong>main gateway</strong>, <strong>garden</strong>, <strong>mosque</strong>, <strong>jawāb </strong>(literally “answer”, a building mirroring the mosque), and <strong>mausoleum</strong> (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.</p>
<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose and Symbolic Meaning of Taj Mahal</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
<h5>Projecting unique beauty, the <strong>mausoleum</strong> is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King, and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb.</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Taj Mahal is the <strong>symbol of unconditioned love</strong>. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the Taj Mahal has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaj by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.</p>
<p>As it is built on the <strong>raised platform</strong>, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural <strong>metaphor for Paradise</strong>. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.</p>
<p>Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is a <strong>symbol of compassion and royalty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> emphasizes the <strong>power </strong>vested in royal Mughal patrons.</p>
<h5><strong>Significance of Geography </strong></h5>
<p>Shah Jahan decided to build <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.</p>
<h5><strong>Entering the Complex</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-811" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=975%2C556&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="556" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone</strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna river, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal is built on a square and <strong>raised platform or a plinth</strong>. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of <strong>eight paradises</strong>, rendering the plan <strong>octagonally</strong>. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-814" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=990%2C474&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="474" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?w=455&amp;ssl=1 455w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>central chamber</strong> with an onion-shaped dome is <strong>flanked by four minarets</strong> at the four corners of the plinth. Mounted with a finial and a crescent moon, the dome is a golden spot of wonder. At the lower lever, <strong>four smaller-sized domes</strong> surrounding the central dome. Each small dome comprises a <em><strong>chhatri</strong></em><em> </em>(kiosk), enclosing a balcony.</p>
<p>The <strong>arched gate</strong> to enter the tomb is called <em><strong>iwan</strong></em><strong><em>.</em></strong> It is framed by a rectangular and decorated surface called <em><strong>Pishtaq</strong></em><strong>.</strong> The gates and other walls project <strong>chamfered corners</strong>, a peculiar style of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the four minarets are tilted away from the central dome, as a precautionary act to avoid damage to the main structure, especially during an occurrence of a natural calamity. Minarets also have a <em><strong>chhatri </strong></em>and a staircase to reach the top. They are associated with the religious duty of calling for daily prayers. The <em><strong>muezzin</strong></em>, the official assigned the announcing duty, calls the public for the <em><strong>namaz</strong></em><em> </em>or prayer from these minarets.</p>

<h5><strong>The Bodies at Rest</strong></h5>
<p>The central chamber places the two cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaj. Shah Jahan died thirty years after his wife. Mumtaj died after giving birth to their 14th offspring in 1631.</p>
<p>The real <strong>sarcophagi</strong> are safely stored at the lower level. The sarcophagi are ornate with <strong>calligraphy</strong>. The surface calligraphic verses from Quran are <strong>inlaid in precious stones</strong>. The technique is known as Pietra dura, which uses cut and polished colored stones. The verses refer to the paradise and day of judgment, wherein God royally and dutifully rewards the faithful.</p>
<p>The tomb shows <strong>floral patterns</strong> as animal or human figures are prohibited, as per Islam protocols. In addition, the <em><strong>jali</strong></em><em> </em>or mesh decorative work and <strong>lapidary</strong> relating to the engraving, cutting, or polishing of stones and gems is frequently observed.</p>

<h5><strong>A Place of Wonder </strong></h5>
<p>Considered as <strong>one of the seven man-made wonders of the world</strong>, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is known as the <strong>Crown of the Palace</strong>. Originally, it was known as Rauza-i-munawwara, which means illuminated tomb. It is situated in Agra, a northern city of India.</p>
<p>In 1983, UNESCO designated the Taj Mahal and the complex as <strong>World Heritage site</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Yesterday and Today</strong></h5>
<p>During the time the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> was built, the Indian continent observed an entry of Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, incrementing the business with Indian counterparts. The presence of Europeans also appears in many Mughal paintings, proving their acceptance in Mughal courts.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan was a promoter of arts and culture, which did not pass onto the next Mughal ruler and his son Aurangzeb. Hence, Aurangzeb&#8217;s disinterest and disengagement led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving the ground for Britishers to take charge by the 18th century.</p>
<p>Taj Mahal oversees millions of worldwide tourists every year. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns, resulting in many newer rules and regulations for the visitors. Nevertheless, the penchant of Shah Jahan for erecting a wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection is path breaking. Continuing to draw visitors to Agra to glimpse this architectural beauty, even after four hundred years, Taj Mahal continues to inspire awe.</p>

<p><strong>Folio from a Qur’an </strong>was created with <strong>ink, color,</strong> and <strong>gold</strong> on <strong>parchment paper. </strong>The paper was costly and made from sheep or goat skin.  The work measures <strong>12 inches wide. </strong></p>
<p>The word <strong>folio</strong> simply means a <strong>page in a book</strong>. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p>The page uses <strong>calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used by early scribes is known as <strong>Kufic. </strong>This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>illuminated manuscript</strong> or a medieval Biblical book (5th – 14th centuries). Illuminated can <strong>refer to vibrancy of color</strong> or illuminated can refer to <strong>the viewer’s enlightenment while reading the text</strong>.</p>
<p>On each page there is <strong>Greek text on top and corresponding image below. </strong>Only 48 out of 192 pages survive. Originally the <strong>pages were purple</strong> which was an expensive dye. Potentially a royal patron? The <strong>lettering was silver</strong> and has now tarnished.</p>
<p><strong>Images use a continuous narrative</strong> that bends upon itself because there is not enough room. We understand that the figures on the bottom are closer, even though there is no differentiation of size.</p>

<p><strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>is an example of<strong> decorative arts </strong>that is both beautiful and utilitarian. Made of  solid <strong>ivory</strong> from the tusk of an elephant, the work stands <strong>6 inches tall</strong>.  Ivory was expensive, durable, smooth, elegant, and easily carved, making it a highly desirable material. This pyxis was made from the famous workshop of Madinat al-Zahra</p>
<p>Islamic art is not always <strong>aniconic</strong>, meaning it does not use animal or human form. It is religiously <strong>aniconic</strong> only. In non-religious or secular and for private use, representational images can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong>: literally means “<em>fear of emptiness</em>” and refers to artwork that is completely full of imagery. This decorative work is an example of this. The work is dense, overcrowded, and intricate, with no space for recession.</p>

<h5><strong>Politically Utilitarian</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>was a gift to 18-year-old al-Mughira, son of a caliph, as a coming of age present. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is cylindrical box with a separate lid. The one has a <strong>utilitarian</strong> purpose, as it was used for cosmetics. Royal men wore makeup, particularly eye makeup, as a sign of status.</p>
<p>Ivory objects were given to royalty on important occasions. Think marriage, birth, and coming of age.</p>
<p>Such works expresses the political authority of the Spanish Umayyads.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This work is decorated with four eight-lobed medallions. This is symbolism of the number eight. It represents the eight levels of Paradise. There are carved falconers, griffons, peacocks, birds, and animals to be hunted.</p>
<p><strong>Royal iconography</strong> includes courtly figures and lute players. Falcons were a symbol of Umayyad legitimacy and power. Date palm trees may allude to the lost Umayyad lands of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The two lions symbolize the Umayyads.</p>
<p>The inscription reads: “God’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him.”</p>

<p><strong>Basin <em>(Baptistère de St. Louis</em>) </strong><strong>Muhammad ibn al-Zain </strong>measures <strong>20 inches wide</strong> and is made with <strong>brass </strong>and <strong>inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p>Brass is a mix of copper and zinc. For a work to be inlaid with silver and gold, it requires delicate hammering. Artists used the combination of metals to provide contrast and emphasis and to allow the viewer to see the figures easier. The entire work in decorated, even inside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-835" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=700%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="405" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?w=567&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Since this work is a secular piece there is a relaxation of <strong>aniconism </strong>and it instead contains representational imagery.  Figures are <strong>stylized</strong>, dense, overlapping, with no clear sense of space parallel to picture plane.</p>
<p>Note: Figures do not have halos, rather this has been done to help highlight the figures’ faces and distinguish them from the surrounding inlaid silver work.</p>
<h5><strong>Original Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended for a wealthy Muslim courtly secular audience. It was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk as a banqueting vessel or basin for handwashing.</p>
<h5><strong>Eventual Function</strong></h5>
<p>Somehow this work ended up in France. It was used during the 17<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> centuries to baptize French royal children (<strong>appropriation</strong>) although the association with St. Louis is probably fictional.</p>
<p>WHY would the French royalty be okay using an Islamic object to BAPTIZE French ROYAL children? The answer is unknown, as is the answer to how the Basin ends up in French royal hands</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1463" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-Teacher.jpg?resize=405%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="405" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-Teacher.jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-Teacher.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Since this was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk, it probably depicts specific individuals and Mamluk battles. <strong>Iconography </strong>is very dense and complex. It has not been interpreted much by historians and the meanings are probably lost</p>
<p>The <strong>exterior</strong> has four figures in roundels, each on horseback. Two are hunting. One is drawing a bow and arrow. One is holding a club. These may be personifications of the different aspects of Mamluk horsemanship. There are Mamluk officials, macebearers, ax-bearers, and bow-bearers.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom bands</strong> are registers of animals that decorate the basin.</p>
<p>The common symbol is the <strong>fleur de lys</strong>. Ultimately this became the symbol of the French family, which may explain the use by the French, but this was also the symbol of the Mamluk sultans.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mamluks</strong> were warrior slaves in Egypt who took control of several Muslim regions. They established a <strong>dynasty from Egypt to Syria from 1250-1517</strong> when Ottomans conquered them.</p>
<p>Political and military dominance led to wealth which led to a flourishing artistic culture known for brass.</p>

<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet,</strong> from <strong>Iran</strong>, is made from <strong>silk </strong>warps and wefts with <strong>wool </strong>pile. The wool was added because it naturally absorbs dyes, which are all natural come from items such as pomegranates and indigo. Rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, natural arabesques make for a stunning carpet.</p>
<p>The carpet measures <strong>34 by 17 feet</strong>. There are <strong>340 knots per square inch</strong>.  That means there are <strong>over 28 million knots in The Ardabil Carpet. </strong>This means it was not only very plush but also highly intricate AND durable. It is interesting to note that a commercial rug today has only 80-160 knots per square inch.</p>

<h5><strong>Why was this Created?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> was <strong>made for prayer</strong> in the funerary shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili. The carpet is one of a matching pair and was made when the shrine was enlarged under the reign of Shah Tahmasp He was a very famous and popular Sufi mystic.</p>
<p>This shrine was considered sacred to Safavid rulers and subjects and therefore it received many offerings. It remained at the shrine for three centuries until they were removed to England.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer carpets</strong> like these decorated the floors of mosques, shrines, and homes – anywhere prayer occurred. Muslims must pray 5 times a day, oriented towards Mecca. Prayer carpets help to unify all members  as they pray together and create sense of community</p>
<p>Carpets like these were also considered works of art and Iranian carpets were prized for their intricate designs. Carpets were sold by craftspeople across Islamic lands and into China and Europe.  The Ardabil Carpet however attests to the great skills achieved in carpet by the people of north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Made the Ardabil Carpet?</strong></h5>
<p>It was made by a royal weaving factory, overseen by Maqsud Kashan. It is estimated that <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> would have taken four years to make, if 10 people were working on weaving it. Men were the weavers, even though women often did the actual weaving, but  the size and importance “necessitated and required” men.</p>
<h5><strong>Changing the Rules</strong></h5>
<p>Carpet used for religious purpose are supposed to be aniconic. The Ardabil Carpet it is not! It does however have two prayer lamps designed on it. These are likely to mimic lamps found on the ceiling of this funerary shrine, which would have created visual unity between the rug and its surroundings</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> is full of typical Islamic designs. There are geometric patterns, florals, and vegetative designs. Such designs belong to a class known as <strong>Northwest Medallion Carpets</strong>, which is one of 30 classifications for Persian carpets.</p>
<p>Ten colors were used in the design, and all were naturally sourced from items such pomegranates, the yellow spice saffron and indigo for the deep blue background. The white or cream shades were left naturally undyed.</p>

<p><strong>Northwestern Medallion Carpets</strong> are generally dominated by a central medallion.  In the center of <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> there is a gold medallion with a light blue roundel in the center, with floating open lotus blossoms. From the medallion 16 ovals circulate. Each is a different color in either red, green, or cream.</p>

<h5><strong>The Inscription</strong></h5>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an inscription of <strong>poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<p><em>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</em></p>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The <strong>fourth line</strong> provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>A Comparison of the Two Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>In Persia in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it was not uncommon for important carpets to be woven in pairs. The Los Angeles carpet, although smaller after having had outer borders removed, is identical the Albert and Victoria carpet. The central medallion for example measures each other precisely.</p>
<p>The only thing that differs is the wool quality and weaving techniques in knot count, texture, and pile length. The London carpet has between 340 knots per square inch, while the Los Angeles carpet has 380 to 420 knots per square inch. Through this research the conclusion was made the rugs were not woven simultaneously, but within the same year. Some art historians believe that the Los Angeles carpet was woven first, because of the finer weave.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet is </strong>one of the oldest Islamic carpets in the word. It is named after the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.  This town was the home was a Sufi saint named Safi al-Din Ardabili who died in 1334. Sufism is Islamic mysticism.</p>
<p>After the saint died, his followers continued to grow and expand. Then, in 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma’il, seized power and united Iran, making the official religion Shi’a Islam. This was <strong>Safavids dynasty </strong>which ruled until 1722. This was an exciting period of art in the creation of textiles (the art of the loom) and manuscripts ( the art of the book).</p>
<p>It is estimated that today 1500 carpets and carpet fragments exist from the Safavid period.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bahram Gur Fights the Karg</em></strong><em>, </em>a <strong>folio</strong> from the <em>Great Il-Khanid Shahnama, </em>is a work in ink and opaque watercolor, using gold and silver on paper, measuring 8 by 5.5 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>This is real paper. The knowledge of how to make this was this diffused from China through the Mongol Empire.</p>
<p>There are <strong>57 surviving illustrations </strong>all created with a vibrancy of colour that depict characteristics of the Ilkhanid (Mongol) period of manuscripts. The pages are large in format and the space is often entirely painted or decorated.</p>
<p>Figures are monumental compared to the landscape, which means there is a  low horizon line. Both are stylized. Atmospheric perspective is used. There is a heavy use of black line for contouring. Text and drawing are combined on the pages.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>manual </strong>for royal conduct of Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire (like Machiavelli’s The Prince). It is a  sign of Mongol leaders’ worldliness and sophistication. The <strong>cross-cultural influences</strong> show acceptance, interest in trade and diffusion.</p>
<p>It is a work <strong>propaganda</strong> that links the Mongols to the great lineage of Persian rulers. Since this is a Shahnama that the Mongols commissioned, it illustrates that the Mongols are trying to liken themselves to the Persian rulers in this text by showing it is of interest to them. Mongols were foreign rulers, so this was especially important.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of this book were made. It is assumed that it was commissioned by a high-ranking member of the Ilkhanid court</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shahnama (Book of Kings)</strong> is a compilation of stories about Persian/Iranian rulers, originally from 1010. It tells the stories of ancient heroes and kings Pre-Islamic Iran. It is based on truth but aggrandized and some parts are fictional and sensationalized. Full of adventure, romance, and a guide to ethics, the  good kings are lauded.</p>
<p>One of the kings in the text is Bahram Gur. As Sassanian King from 430-438 CE. He wears a robe of European fabric to slay a fearsome horned wolf (the Karg). The setting shows influence from Chinese landscapes</p>
<h5><strong>Importance of Illustrated Books</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Illustrated books</strong> were a very important art form in Iran. It flourished  during a cultural Golden Age led by the Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire. This was the Mongol Empire in the Middle East.  Manuscript illumination was highly prized by Mongols.</p>
<p>The Mongols ruled as foreigners in a conquered land. They employed words and images to legitimize their rule and by linking themselves with great native Persian rulers of the past?</p>
<h5><strong>Diversity of Court</strong></h5>
<p>Mongol court was very diverse and cross-cultural, and this influence ended up in artwork. much of this diversity and cross-cultural influence ended up in the artwork. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persian story of Shahnama</li>
<li>Mongol patron in the Middle East</li>
<li>European realism / fabric / sense of space with low horizon line</li>
<li>Chinese landscape (trees, foliage) / calligraphic black line &amp; knowledge of paper</li>
<li>Persian technique of vibrant watercolors</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Jahangir</strong></em><em><strong> Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</strong></em><strong> </strong>is also known as <em><strong>Jahangir</strong></em><em><strong> Enthroned on an Hourglass</strong></em>. This <strong>work on paper, by artist Bichitr</strong>,  is comprised of <strong>watercolor, gold and ink</strong> and measures <strong>10 inches tall.</strong></p>
<p>It is one of the <strong>symbolic paintings</strong> of Jahangir&#8217;s reign, eulogizing the power status of the contemporary dynasty. One of the many novel expression methods, the symbolism is distinctly handled.</p>
<p>To view you must concentrate on the <strong>aesthetics of composition</strong>, <strong>color palette</strong>, and a manipulative variation of <strong>figural sizes</strong>.</p>
<p>Bichitra, the painter, depicted various <strong>vegetal forms</strong> along with the <strong>calligraphic</strong> verses on the border. This trademark work combining many regional influences, illustrates Bichitra’s use of <strong>cross-cultural motifs</strong> to convey Mughal principles. Jahangir accepted European entry into the Indian subcontinent, which brought in <strong>western motifs in Indian art</strong>. This included Mughal miniatures are a part of larger books.</p>
<p>The thick and colorful <strong>floral border</strong> on the painting defines the Jahangir-era of Mughal art. The folio, as part of Muraqqa, establishes the spiritual trait of Jahangir’s personality by portraying the Sufi Sheikh as a prior figure after himself.</p>
<h5><strong>The Main Characters</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?resize=592%2C487&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="592" height="487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>The painting comprises five human figures of a reputed status, in decreasing order of visual size. The largest figure is that of <strong>King Jahangir</strong>, while the man in front of him is <strong>Sufi Sheikh Hussain</strong>, in a dimension little shorter than him. The king is adorned with jewelry as opposed to pale garb of the sheikh.</p>
<p>King Jahangir is handing over a book to the Sufi Sheikh Hussain, which he accepts in a shawl, avoiding the physical contact, as an imperial protocol.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-848" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-C.jpg?resize=375%2C752&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="375" height="752" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-C.jpg?w=167&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-C.jpg?resize=150%2C300&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Ottoman sultan, King James I and the artist make a cameo.</strong></p>
<p>The figure below the spiritual leader is an <strong>Ottoman sultan</strong>, followed by <strong>English King James I</strong>. Ottoman sultan&#8217;s turban-tied headdress distinguishes him as a foreigner to the Mughal court, while he awaits his chance to greet Jahangir. King James I, in his royal attire, gazes out of the painting, which is a typical style of European art.</p>
<p>The last figure is that of <strong>the artist</strong> himself, <strong>Bichitra</strong>. Despite the significance over the form of the King’s figure, the ochre-chrome yellow garb of Bichitra grabs the attention compulsively. However, the attire&#8217;s fashion indicates that he was a Hindu artist in the Mughal court. He is holding a miniature painting, which suggests his profession.</p>
<h5><strong>Adaptations of European Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from these, the other flying semi-human forms are <strong>putti figures</strong>, which are European-influenced characters.</p>
<p><strong>The halo</strong> behind the Jahangir’s head, and <strong>hourglass</strong>, are further adaptations of European forms. Concentric in kind, glaring flames around the head seemingly recognize his sun-like illuminated and authoritative demeanor.</p>
<p>At the same time, the crescent moon at the lower arc of the halo is a prevalent representation of spiritual enlightenment in Jain paintings. Symbolically, the crescent moon also narrates the endless cycle of day and night.</p>
<p><strong>King Jahangir</strong> is seated on a large and ornate <strong>hourglass</strong>. On the putti on the hourglass are engraving with an inscription that reads, “Allah is great. O Shah may the span of your reign be a thousand years”.</p>
<p>The hourglass is an emblematic attribute of the beginning of the new Islamic millennium, it begins with the rule of a knowledgeable Mughal ruler.</p>
<p>From these forms we can infer that Bichitra had been studying European artworks that were accepted by the king as gifts.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism</strong></h5>
<p>While figures are naturalistic and convincingly real, space itself is tipped <strong>upwards and flattened</strong>. A few areas are painted in gradual tonal values, while the rest is in flat application of colors. Artist has utilized a <strong>colorful palette</strong> with incredibly precise and intricate detailing. Notably, the division of backdrop helps in acquiring a rhythmic gaze over the work.</p>
<p>An ornate lower half, which apparently is a Persianate carpet, is replete with <strong>abstract, repetitive, and naturalistic design.</strong> In addition, the artist has neglected linear perspective to feature the content significantly.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Frames Within Frames</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-844" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-844" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=500%2C729&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="729" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-844" class="wp-caption-text">Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings<br />© Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The painting is enclosed in a <strong>group of rectangular frames</strong> that show a varying <strong>floral and calligraphic designs</strong>. Bordering with repetitive and small decorative cartouches, the background of the folio has floral arabesque. These <strong>floral motifs</strong> are inspired by the local flowers of the region.</p>
<p>At the cusp of the painting, on the vertical edges, the band depicts a calligraphic verse praising the king. The lower band expresses, “Though outwardly Shahs stand before him, he fixes his gaze on dervishes.”</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Mughal miniatures</strong> were often a part of a more comprehensive book project called <strong>Muraqqa</strong>. Murraqas describes lives of Mughal kings or elites. They were accessible to the selected and not common men. After the volume was written, it would be given to an artist with secluded pages to illustrate the relevant narratives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this folio was to render a spiritual and wise image of noble Mughal King Jahangir. As he preferred a spiritual Sufi Sheikh over the kings of the world, he is indicated to be a grand sovereign of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Mughal paintings are said to have used <strong>gold, silver, and lapiz lazuli</strong>, among other hues, for rendition. The usage of material depended on the project and the role it played over the larger mass. The <strong>colors</strong> were generally obtained from <strong>local natural resources</strong>. For example, white was made by grinding the conch, while black from the lamp residue.</p>
<p>In addition, Mughal kings followed greater political propaganda to disperse the might of the Mughal ruler. It also displayed Jahangir’s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety’s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.</p>
<h5><strong>Traditions</strong></h5>
<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance</strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.</p>
<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him</strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp’s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous <em>Hamzanama</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hamzanama </em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers</strong>.</p>
<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir’s court painters</p>
<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Bichitra (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to <em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em> under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases. <em>Baburnama</em>, <em>Akbarnama</em>, <em>Tujuk-I- </em><em>Jahangir</em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing ateliers</strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.</p>
<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.</strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved</strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette</strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts</strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.</p>
<p>During Akbar’s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong> was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir’s reign.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>World of signs, of the transcendental, and of the imaginary, <strong>Byzantium</strong> is whole only in its Christian-Hellenistic duality. </em></p></blockquote>
<h5>The Layers of Meaning of a Byzantine  Ring</h5>
<p>A marriage in Byzantium evokes the embroidered gowns and <span data-ri="1">pearl-studded </span><span data-ri="2">crowns promoted by the imperial mosaics adorning the Byzantine Churches from Ravenna to Constantinople. The Byzantine marriage objects that have come down to us, mostly from buried treasures or burials, are not very numerous. However, they exposed the much less noticeable <strong>finger-ring</strong> as the quintessential element of a Byzantine marriage</span><span data-ri="3">.</span><sup><span data-ri="4">1</span></sup></p>
<p><span data-ri="6">Usually worn on the third finger, the marriage rings were not reserved for women, being also popular with men.</span><sup><span data-ri="7">1</span></sup><span data-ri="8"> Along with other bridal luxury gifts &#8211; ivory caskets, pyxides, and gold marriage  belts- the AF.232 British Museum <strong>gold finger-ring</strong> was reserved for the upper classes of the early Byzantine Empire.</span><sup><span data-ri="9">2,3</span></sup></p>
<p><span data-ri="10">The more modest clientele used less noble metals, even if the misspelled “OM(o)NYA-concord” bezel inscription, and the rather crude engravings  on the ring’s bezel reflect more the owner’s wealth than her rank. Although the ring’s figural iconography articulates an overtly Christian visual propaganda, apparently neutral design elements unveil how the <strong>pagan rituals and Christianity coalesced into a hidden message</strong> of universal intercession and protection for the ring’s owner. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_752" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-752" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-961 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-09-04-at-10.30.17-PM.png?resize=990%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-752" class="wp-caption-text">Octagonal Hoop Inscription <span data-ri="1">(John 14:27), Byzantine finger-ring 5th century AC(AF.232) © The Trustees of the British Museum</span></figcaption></figure>
<h4><strong><em>Mark 10:9  &#8220;What G-d had joined together &#8230; &#8220;</em></strong></h4>
<p>Following the 337AC conversion of the emperor Constantine, Christian art triumphed. The early Christian apologists considered the offering of a gold ring an ancestral marriage custom, free of pagan stigma.<sup><span data-ri="2">4</span></sup> <span data-ri="4"> Mirroring signet rings, the women marriage rings could b</span><span data-ri="5">e</span><span data-ri="6"> used to authenticate documents and secure household items, underlining a Christian wife’s role in administering the family wealth.</span><sup><span data-ri="7">5,6</span></sup><span data-ri="8">  </span></p>
<p><span data-ri="8">We can easily distinguish in this 6th-7th centuries AC ring a young art, whose lively imagination is enchanted by <strong>Christian symbols</strong> and welded with the reasoned expression of <strong>classical art.</strong> The ring metalworking process seems borrowed directly from late Roman goldsmiths. However, the Byzantine aesthetic heightened the taste for polychromy, expressed here by the use of black niello. </span></p>
<p><span data-ri="8">The symmetrical composition of the bezel reflects the relative equality of rights of the couple.</span><sup><span data-ri="9">7</span></sup> <span data-ri="11">T</span><span data-ri="12">he bride and groom are dressed formally in a modest “tunica recta” and, respectively, a “chlamys” hold in place with a l</span><span data-ri="13">arge</span><span data-ri="14"> fibula. Their heads are joyfully crowned with Roman nuptial wreaths, or coin-inspired spiked imperial headgears.</span><sup><span data-ri="15">8</span></sup><span data-ri="16"> The bride was not veiled. </span></p>
<p><span data-ri="16">The Christian identity of the ring owner, however, filtered her understanding of the Roman concept of marital harmony. Exuding an imperial marriage solidus vibe, <strong>the ring’s central figure is Christ</strong>. He is engraved at a slightly larger scale to emphasize the importance of his role. Christ acts as “deus pronubus” replacing the Roman goddesses Juno and Concordia. Christ only touches the couple shoulders to unite them in marriage. They do not join their right hands together in the Roman marital “dextrarum iunctio”. </span></p>
<p><span data-ri="16">Christ’s crossed halo emphasizes his sacrifice, while the abridged <strong>John 14:27</strong> verse on the hoop <strong>“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you“</strong> highlights the Christian belief that only God’s grace leads to universal harmony, not human acts.</span><sup><span data-ri="17">9</span></sup></p>
<h5><strong>The Mysterious Star</strong></h5>
<p><span data-ri="18"> The adoption of the theory-cult of Virgin Mary might have played a role in the choice of a <strong>star engraving below the bride’s feet</strong>. Remarkably, this mysterious star appears on only one other British Museum Byzantine ring</span><span data-ri="19">. This second ring features back to back Christ and the Virgin blessing the newlyweds. The </span><span data-ri="20">star is engraved above the Virgin.</span><sup><span data-ri="21">10</span></sup></p>
<p><span data-ri="22">Concurrently, the mosaics of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo Basilica also depicted a star gleaming on the enthroned Virgin’s veil.</span><sup><span data-ri="23">1</span><span data-ri="24">1</span></sup><span data-ri="25"> The later Orthodox Church iconography connected the three stars adorning the veil of Mary Theotokos -“Mother of God” to her alleged triple “virgin” status: before, during, and after her pregnancy with Christ.</span><sup><span data-ri="26">1</span><span data-ri="27">2</span></sup><span data-ri="28"> Thus, it seems possible that <strong>the star symbolized the virgin status of the bride.</strong></span></p>

<h5><strong><em>1 Thessalonians 5:8  &#8220;Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.&#8221;</em></strong></h5>
<p>The association between the Byzantine bride imagery and the Virgin Mary has, however, its limitations, as Byzantine women <strong>fertility was often celebrated</strong> with mixed visual messages. Fear, death, hope, and desire all loomed above marital happiness and childbirth, dividing the ring meanings between the <strong>Christian expectations</strong> and the <strong>Hellenistic customs</strong> of warding off evil. The medico-magical rituals of the Kyranides book, the erotic Dionysian rites, and the <span data-ri="2">poems of Dioscorus of Aphrodito commingled with Christianity</span><span data-ri="3">.</span><span data-ri="4"><sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span data-ri="6"> Recognizable Annunciation images, and Christ officiating under a canopy, presumably at the Jewish marriage in Cana were engraved together with “protective” biblical inscriptions in the Byzantine &#8220;Christian amulets&#8221;.</span><span data-ri="9"><sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p><span data-ri="10">To address such derives, the bishops continuously enacted <strong>punishments against magic</strong> for more than three centuries, from the early legislative acts of the Emperor Constantius II (337-361AC) to the ones of the Council in Trullo (691-692AC).</span><span data-ri="13"><sup>15</sup></span><span data-ri="15"> The alleged magical childbirth amulets of the ring were its octagonal bezel and hoop, as well as the “OM(o)NYA” inscription.</span><span data-ri="16"><sup>16,17,18 </sup></span></p>
<p><span data-ri="18"><strong>Octagons</strong> were popular among the early Christians, possibly referencing Christ’s resurrection and their own rebirth hopes. The engraved “protective” verse also seems to reinforce the magical shield of the ring since the unabridged text John 14:27 urges Christians to have faith and not be afraid.</span></p>

<p>Taken together, the ring’s <strong>Hellenistic and Christian elements</strong> convey a nuanced and syncretic message of perpetual protection for the couple. At a larger scale, the persistence of magic in the progressively Christianized Byzantine society illustrates the interwoven coexistence of two radically different belief systems.</p>

<p><span data-ri="0">Anne-Sarah thanks Dr. McGuire and Dr. Lodwick of University of California at Santa Cruz for feedback she received on her research done to establish the meaning of the star below the bride&#8217;s feet.  Pointing out the Annunciation and the Magi,  Dr. McGuire suggested a  wish for safe childbirths. It was a very logical connection, yet I thought it to be too vague for the economy of a bezel. The star probably connected the bride to Mary, but how? Looking up in the Byzantine iconography, I learned that starting 700-800AC Mary’s veil was depicted with three stars symbolizing her triple virginity.  Our back-and-forth debate determined me to keep looking for the missing link &#8211; an early depiction of Mary with only one star.  Once, the argument became stronger, the line of thought accurate and logic, the implementation time came. Dr. Lodwick&#8217;s unconditional support and her many patient answers helped me better my writing and formatting. Thank you.</span><span data-ri="1">  </span></p>

<h3><strong>Theme: “Height and Light”</strong></h3>
<p>Two major <strong>Gothic </strong>innovations in architecture involved new <strong>soaring heights</strong> and the use of <strong>stained-glass windows</strong> to illuminate the interior, both as accomplished by flying buttresses.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Context (1150-1400 CE)</strong></h5>
<p>Gothic art emerged because of the universities in Paris that were intellectual centers, along with an increasing wealth in the city which led to new patronage.  There was also an increasing interest in Marian Devotion or Cult of the Virgin.</p>
<h5><strong>Europe Around 1200</strong></h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Major Events during the Gothic Period</strong></h5>
<p>Major events influenced art during the Gothic period. During the Babylonian Captivity (1304-1377), the papacy moved to Avignon, France, but then returned to Rome in 1377. This led multiple claimants to papacy in Rome and Avignon.</p>
<p>The battles of the Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453) continued between France and England. This was a war over English-controlled French territory.</p>
<p>The Black Death (1348) was interpreted as a punishment from God.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>French Gothic architecture</strong> typically has 3 styles:</p>
<p><strong>Early Gothic</strong> (Lancet Style) of the 12<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup> century introduced round interior columns and rib vaults only extending to the capitals.</p>
<p><strong>High Gothic</strong> (Rayonnant) of the 14<sup>th</sup> century added: rib vaults extended to the floor, sheets of stained glass, rose windows, exterior sculpture, refined tracery, and weightlessness with a strong verticality.</p>
<p><strong>Late Gothic</strong> (Flamboyant) of the 15<sup>th</sup> century is also called “flaming”, which is the English translation from the French word flamboyant. Late Gothic is highly decorative with ogee arches.</p>

<h5><strong>Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture During the Middle Ages in the Christian West</strong></h5>
<p>Two styles of religious architecture dominated the landscape: Romanesque and Gothic art. The influence of the Christian religion in art and the triumph of Christianity throughout the Middle Ages could be measured by the number of buildings constructed for worship .To welcome an increasing number faithful, encourage pilgrimage and show its power, the Church built larger places of worship and adjusted the inner space by adding at first side-aisles and an ambulatory followed by radial chapels behind the choir.</p>
<p>If the golden age of the first is in the 11th-12th centuries, that of the Gothic corresponds to the 12th-15th centuries, also called &#8220;the time of cathedrals”. These two very opposite styles of church the <strong>Romanesque and the Gothic</strong> allow a double reading of the objective sought by the representatives of the Church.</p>
<p>For some, the “house of God” must be the modest and not “flashy”. Ideally it should be a medium-sized building, with few openings and little light, with a very sober decor avoiding any distraction and encouraging the faithful to focus on prayer. This is <strong>the conception of the Romanesque style</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Romanesque Church</strong> can be formally described as a massive building with <strong>stone vaults</strong> and a great sobriety. It will <strong>progress into the shape of a Latin cross </strong>. To support these massive stone vaults the <strong>thickness of the walls</strong> were increased or the height of the nave controlled by <strong>reducing the dimensions of the windows</strong>.</p>
<p>Romanesque art rediscovers the process of the <strong>vault </strong>known to the Romans. The ceilings were initially made of wood. Later the architects favored the stone vault, as it was heavier and generating mainly thrusts on the sides. The barrel vault technique combined with the use of stone allows the construction of larger and more massive buildings because the walls carrying the vault are reinforced by <strong>buttresses.</strong>  The rounded stone barrel vault, the interior supports and exterior buttresses (walls used to reinforce the facades that support the vault) were often massive.</p>
<p>From the 12th century , we witness <strong>monumental sculptures</strong>, as French artists discovered statuary . The <strong>Church of Sainte-Foy</strong> is one of the most famous Romanesque churches in France because of its Judgement tympanum and its symbolic control flow of the pilgrims. They entered through the sinners’ part, prayed in the church to the relics of Saint -Foy and exited the church on the entrance guarded by the interceding Saint-Foy, patriarchs, and the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>The spread of <strong>Romanesque art</strong> led to <strong>regional styles</strong>. In France, the Burgundian School built monuments , preceded by imposing porches and covered with a rich sculpture (Cluny). Yet, along the Rhine the churches are severe, massive buildings with multiple towers.</p>

<h5><strong>The Evolution of Gothic Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gothic art</strong> resulted from a slow evolution of Romanesque art . It owed its success to the technical solution it brought to the problem of supporting the vault . Its first step was the use of the <strong>groin vaulting and a pointed arch</strong>.  This was probably borrowed from Islamic architecture. It relieved some of the thrust and helped reduce the size of the columns. The new slender columns appear in the late Romanesque buildings.</p>
<p>In the 12th century, the French architects succeeded in supporting the heavy Romanesque vault on <strong>ribbed vaulting with the addition of cross ribs</strong>. Later different fan vaulting shapes extended from the tops of the columns. It therefore sufficed to apply flying buttresses to the outside, so that these in turn transmitted the thrust to the lateral buttresses, placed on the ground.</p>
<p>The thick side walls serving as reinforcements were removed and huge broken arch windows, typical of Gothic art, were pierced.</p>
<p><strong>Stained-glass windows</strong> developed and enlarged. The art of stained glass also appeared in the 12th century reflecting a spiritual intention to offer the faithful the feeling of entering a sacred space bathed in a divine light, and to educate the illiterate masses on the stories of the Old/New Testament. The mastery of the technique is developing on several sites including Chartres, and the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris.</p>
<p>To manufacture stained glass windows with a great intensity of colors, it is necessary to have pigments in large quantities. These pigments were rare, expensive and some had to be imported from great distances like lapis lazuli with which to obtain a deep blue. The quality of the stained-glass windows in Paris proves the significant financial expenses collected and incurred in the construction of the cathedral.</p>
<p>Increasing amounts of tracery, or ornate stonework that held the windows, became more decorated. Other stonework such as <strong>pinnacles, and gargoyles</strong> was added as well. This period corresponds to that of <strong>primitive Gothic ( 1140-1200 )</strong> which was followed by the era of <strong>triumphant/Golden Age Gothic ( 1200-1400 )</strong> which continued until the Renaissance in the <strong>mid-15th century, so-called flamboyant Gothic.</strong></p>
<p>The imposing cathedrals date mainly from the golden age of Gothic, <strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong> (started in 1163 ), with its powerful towers and vast grandstands, <strong>Notre-Dame de Chartres</strong> ( 1194 ) with its immense nave and its three portals, adorned with statues; the royal <strong>Notre-Dame de Reims</strong> ( 1210 ) with its famous facade and incomparable statuary and <strong>Saint Peter Cathedral of Cologne</strong> (1248–1473). From the oldest to the most recent, there is an incessant search for progress and an increasing lightness in construction.</p>
<p>Most of the cathedrals were not completed in the 13th century and even remained incomplete for a long time. The resources necessary for finishing them were provided by all social classes. The clergy provided funding and provided religious themes for the decoration of the building. The Christians also took part in it providing their free work force on construction sites and contributing financially as well.</p>
<p><strong>During the Gothic period the cathedrals under construction required sculptures</strong> and it developed funerary sculpture tools. There was a renewal of the iconographic themes. For the tympanums the preferred scene was the one of the Last Judgment, gallery of the kings of Judah. Responsible for creating volume emphasizing shapes and putting them in motion, the sculptures participated in the dynamics of the facade, to the detriment of their own purpose. The face of the saints had to express this tension and stand out in its sovereign grandeur.</p>
<p>In other fields of art such as the illuminated manuscripts, and the tapestries the contribution is less innovative. The metalwork of precious arts and the enamels develop together with the cult of relics, but many early models such as the statue of Saint-Foy contained spolia.</p>

<h5><strong>Elaborated Architecture to Support a Socio-political Development</strong></h5>
<p>Now that you know the characteristics<strong>—Gothic art and architecture is crazy elaborate—</strong>it’s time to move on to what it’s really about: the social and political stuff…</p>
<p>The Gothic period was a period of great social and political transformation. Five major sociopolitical developments set the Gothic era apart from the Romanesque and Early Middle Ages.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Five Major Social-political Developments</strong></h5>
<p>The Gothic period was a period of great social and political transformation. Five major sociopolitical developments set the Gothic era apart from the Romanesque and Early Middle Ages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Religious structures</li>
<li>Societal Structure</li>
<li>Universities</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Monarchy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Religious Structures</strong></p>
<p>Just as urban universities superseded the rural monasteries as centers of learning, the urban cathedrals replaced the monasteries as centers of religious patronage.</p>
<p>Cathedrals were central fixtures in urban life:</p>
<ul>
<li>markets were held in the squares in front of cathedrals</li>
<li>law courts were sometimes located on their steps, and their construction provided jobs</li>
<li>cathedrals represented civic pride, and towns competed with one another to build the biggest and grandest cathedral of all</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Societal Structure</strong></p>
<p>Although European society remained largely rural, cities and towns became increasingly prominent. This prompted the rise of urban commerce and a more complex social structure that included merchants and artisans. Paris emerged as the intellectual and cultural capital of Gothic Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Trade guilds —controlled the production and sale of goods and services. </strong></p>
<p>The strong sense of communal identity that emerged was reinforced by public buildings, churches, artworks, monuments, and ceremonies in cities.</p>
<p><strong>Universities</strong></p>
<p>The rise of urban life was simultaneous with the rise of intellectual life. Universities like Oxford, Padua, and Paris supplanted the monastic schools as centers of learning. These universities educated not only theologians but also lawyers, doctors, and philosophers.</p>
<p>This expansion of secular knowledge led to increasing observation of nature. Gothic religious imagery evolved to incorporate more subjects from the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>In the universities and cathedral schools, a new system of philosophy, scholasticism, arose in response to the renewed interest in texts from classical antiquity by crusaders in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Classical philosophy that promoted rational inquiry challenged Christian theology, which was based on faith. To reconcile the two, theologians applied logic to faith and developed a system of reasoned analysis. By creating logical proofs, scholastic thinkers could explain supernatural phenomena—even the existence of god.</p>
<p><strong>Monarchy</strong></p>
<p>Church remained the chief patron of the arts.</p>
<p>The courts of the secular monarchs increased the representation of nonreligious subjects and political use of sacred imagery.</p>
<p>These monarchies also facilitated the spread of the Gothic style throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Gothic pointed arches and tracery patterns appeared on town halls, illustrated books, decorative objects, table settings, textile patterns, and even shoes.</p>
<h5><strong>Books, Frescos—It Is All Narrative</strong></h5>
<p>During the <strong>Gothic period, bookmaking shifted from monasteries shut off from the world to urban workshops of professional artists for patrons</strong> that included the royal family, scholars, and merchants.</p>
<p><strong>Saint Louis</strong> was an avid collector of both secular and religious books, and his mother, <strong>Blanche of Castile, commissioned a moralized Bible for him</strong>. The dedication page is separated into frames and portrays Blanche and Louis on elaborate thrones with oversized heads, emphasizing their importance. They are framed by cityscapes and are vividly gesturing. Blanche appears to instruct the young Louis, underscoring her superior position as she was regent until he came of age.</p>
<figure id="attachment_534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-534" style="width: 437px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-534" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/61-Scenes-from-Apopcalypse-ENHANCED-1.jpg?resize=437%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="437" height="576" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/61-Scenes-from-Apopcalypse-ENHANCED-1.jpg?w=248&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/61-Scenes-from-Apopcalypse-ENHANCED-1.jpg?resize=228%2C300&amp;ssl=1 228w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-caption-text">Dedication Page with Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France<br />© The Pierpont Morgan Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is significant as royal women were often portrayed as higher status, especially due to the higher status given to the Virgin Mary in art. Blanche and Louis, in similar architectural frames, are a monk and a scribe. The monk is instructing the scribe in a similar fashion to Blanche and Louis.</p>
<p>The narrative style in the <strong><em>Dedication Page with Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France</em></strong> is similar to that used in the wall paintings in the <em>Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel</em>. The wall is separated into frames and has scenes from the life of Christ and the Last Judgment.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Lamentation</em> </strong>scene portrays Mary the Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, John the Evangelist, and other figures gathered around the dead body of Christ while angels assemble in Heaven. The figures show emotional expressiveness.</p>
<figure id="attachment_442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-442" style="width: 786px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-442" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=786%2C618&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="786" height="618" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-442" class="wp-caption-text">Lamentation<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The angels fling their arms about and wring their hands. John throws his hands back and lets out a cry of grief. Mary Magdalene holds Christ&#8217;s feet, calling to mind the story in which she anointed his feet, and other bystanders exhibit signs of deep sorrow.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Lamentation</em></strong> is evidence of the emerging naturalism and humanism that is occurring in this period.</p>
<p>A similar work, the<strong> <em>Golden Haggadah</em>,</strong> is believed by scholars to have been created by Christian artists for a wealthy Jewish family for use in the home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-445" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?resize=489%2C646&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="489" height="646" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?resize=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1 227w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>A Haggadah is a collection of Jewish prayers and readings</strong> written to accompany the Passover Seder. The Seder occurs on the first two nights of Passover, and the Haggadah is read to retell the story of the Jewish exodus from Egypt. The yearly retelling of the story of exodus during the Seder is to recognize history and bring the story to life for both the teller and the listener.</p>
<h5><strong>Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The term <strong>Romanesque describes the architecture of the 11th and 12th</strong> centuries because it <strong>reflects certain Roman techniques.</strong> Sacred architecture of this time reflected the needs of pilgrimage. <strong>Gothic architecture built on Romanesque styles</strong>, adding height, flying buttresses, and large stained-glass windows because of the idea of lux nova.</p>
<p><strong>Pilgrimage journeys resulted from a spiritual or physical need in search of relics.</strong> Gothic art humanized biblical figures, and moralized Bibles were commissioned for royal families and made by professional artists.</p>

<h5><strong>What is the Difference Between A Church and a Cathedral?</strong></h5>
<p>A church is smaller and has a priest. A cathedral is larger and has a bishop.</p>
<h5><strong>Gothic Innovation</strong></h5>
<p>The architect of this stunning <strong>limestone</strong> cathedral, with <strong>stained glass windows</strong>, <strong>in Chartres, France, </strong>about an hour south of Paris, is unknown.  Gothic style is known for decorative design, detail, and ornamentation. This style of architecture was developed in the Ile de France area around Paris, that was ruled by the King of France.</p>
<p><strong>Pointed arches</strong> were created by moving rounded Roman arches upward. This enables the stress lines to move inward towards the ground, not out diagonally. With taller arches, the roof of the buildings could be raised creating <strong>taller ceilings</strong>. This resulted in a need for light. <strong>Stained glass</strong> became prevalent in Gothic architecture. It allowed not only sunshine through but provided a highly decorative feature.</p>
<p>These raised elements caused less weight on the structures, resulting in <strong>thinner walls</strong>. To support these walls <strong>flying buttresses </strong>were installed to support the arches, right at the point that they were straightening.</p>
<h5><strong>The Façade</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-435" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-435" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60-Chartres-Cathedral-B-2.jpg?resize=500%2C791&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="791" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60-Chartres-Cathedral-B-2.jpg?w=203&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60-Chartres-Cathedral-B-2.jpg?resize=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1 190w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-435" class="wp-caption-text">Chartres Cathedral<br />© Vanni Archive/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>façade</strong> of the building is simple. There is a tower on the left, a center structure called a <strong>westwork</strong>, which is the church entrance, and a tower on the right. The <strong>westwork</strong> was part of the original Romanesque church, which is why it looks heavy against the Gothic cathedral. The tower on the left is the newer Gothic tower. The tower on the right is the older Romanesque tower.</p>
<p>At the top is what is called King’s Gallery, with sculptures of Old Testament royal figures.   Underneath is a<strong> rose window</strong>, a circular stained-glass window, that was a typical adornment for the front of a Gothic church. It symbolized Mary, a rose without thorns.  Below are three <strong>lancet windows, </strong>a type of window that are pointed shaped.  The portals below are covered with sculpture.</p>

<figure id="attachment_436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-436" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-436" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60-Chartes-Cathedral-plan.png?resize=780%2C444&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="780" height="444" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60-Chartes-Cathedral-plan.png?w=402&amp;ssl=1 402w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60-Chartes-Cathedral-plan.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-436" class="wp-caption-text">Chartres Cathedral plan</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>church retains its cross-basilica plan shape</strong>. Church goers entered the cathedral through the middle doors to attend mass. Pilgrims, who were interested in seeing the church’s relics could enter the axillary doors on the far right. Then circle around and exits the doors on the far left, without disturbing mass.</p>
<h5><strong>The Nave</strong></h5>
<p>The cathedral’s <strong>nave</strong> is 50 feet long, with a tall ceiling above at 118 feet. Here there is a three-part elevation. The <strong>Nave arcade on the lower level</strong> contains pointed arches. The <strong>triforium</strong>, on second story cannot, unlike a gallery, be occupied. It gets this name from its common three arch pattern. There is a <strong>clerestory </strong>on the third story with windows. Here each bay of the nave has two <strong>lancet windows</strong>, or pointed window, with one oculus, or round window on top. All contain stained glass.</p>
<p>The three segments of elevation are united by a <strong>compound pier, </strong>or a pier with a group of columns bundled together.  Notice the compound piers have columns that draw your eye upward to the ceiling to create the rib vaults. <strong>Rib vaults</strong> are used to help buttress the pointed vault ceiling where it may be weakest.  Rib vaults can be <strong>quadripartite</strong>, four, like this one, or <strong>sexpartite</strong>, six.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The cathedral holds a <strong>Marian Devotion</strong>, or the Gothic fascination with Mary. Many objects and churches are dedicated to her. The <strong>Sancta Camisa</strong> of Mary, is said to have been given to the Catholic Church by Charlemagne after a trip to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The church symbolized Mary’s body. The ribs in the interior literally symbolized Mary’s ribs. The idea was that if Christ grew in Mary’s womb, then we are the children of Mary, who grow within the literal ribs of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2280" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2280" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/60.-Chartres-Cathedral.jpg?resize=600%2C763&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="763" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/60.-Chartres-Cathedral.jpg?w=246&amp;ssl=1 246w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/60.-Chartres-Cathedral.jpg?resize=236%2C300&amp;ssl=1 236w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2280" class="wp-caption-text">Chartres Cathedral<br />© Paul Maeyaert/The Bridgeman Art Library</figcaption></figure>
<p>Chartres had a cathedral school where classes were taught.  Thus, Mary’s position as Throne of Wisdom was connected to the scholarly activities of this school.</p>
<p>There was a new focus on geometry of the building, through which it approximates Heaven. Mathematics grew in interest as it was believed God created the world according to perfect measurements. The church sought to mirror these measurements and therefore also become divine, as a heaven on earth. The Dimensions are literally based on what the Bible says the dimensions are of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem</p>
<h5><strong>Let There Be Light</strong></h5>
<p>The admittance of light was symbolic of Christ’s presence and divinity in the church. It was also symbolic of the annunciation where the presence of light parallels Christ and the building parallels Mary’s body. Just as Christ passed into Mary’s womb, the light passes into the church.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">The title of this stained-glass panel, in vibrant blues, reds, purples and white. Held together in a led structure means, </span><em style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong>Our Lady of the Beautiful Glass</strong></em><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">. The Virgin Mary is shown enthroned with her feet resting on a footstool.</span></p>
<p>Mary is dressed in royal blue, and haloed with a white veil, which falls on either side of her head.  Blue colored fabric was expensive at the time when most people were dressed in earth tomes. The color blue symbolized the night sky, which is appropriate as she was called the Queen of Heaven,</p>
<p>Mary, was in fact royalty, as a descendent of the kings of Judea. Since Christ was her son, he too was royalty. From the beginning, this indicated to Christians that this was part of God’s plan.</p>
<h5>Throne of Wisdom (<strong>Sedes Sapientae</strong>) ( PORTAL AT FRONT)</h5>
<p>Christ is seated on Mary’s lap. Her right hand is raised in blessing. Her left hand holds an open book which says, “Every valley shall be fille.” This is in reference to Luke 3:5 about clearing the way for Christ’s love.</p>
<p>Most of the population of Europe was illiterate at this time and couldn’t read the Bible. Bibles were rare and expensive. The printing press had not been invented yet, so everything had to be copied by hand. People learned the stories of the Bible by hearing the words of the priest in church and by looking at decoration in the church</p>
<p>Christ appears to be an old-man baby. This is to depict that the Christ child has enormous wisdom even as a baby.</p>
<p>There is a white dove over Mary that extends three rays of light towards Mary’s halo.  This is a reference to the Trinity and that Mary acted as an intercessor between God the father and God the son. Six angels gather around Mary and Christ, holding candles and incense.</p>

<p>The <strong>portal</strong> is the entrance to a church. <strong>Jambs </strong>and <strong>jamb figures</strong> are columns surrounding the door, and figures on them. This is nicknamed the <strong>Royal Portal</strong> because the jamb figures depict Old Testament royalty and therefore the relatives of Christ.</p>
<p>The figures are very elongated with no sense of weigh. The head are lined up together, but the bodies have different lengths with feet dangling down.</p>
<p>There is no sense of classicism, instead they are rigid, with bodies conformed to column shapes. The clothing has a sense of folds, with no human shape underneath.</p>
<h5><strong>History of the Site</strong></h5>
<p>Historians say it was likely there was once a Druid temple here. Next there was a Roman temple, that was converted into a Christian church by the 3<sup>rd</sup> century. Then, in the 9<sup>th</sup> century the church received a relic from Constantinople &#8211;the tunic of Mary. It was rumoured to have been given to the Catholic Church by Charlemagne after a trip to Jerusalem</p>
<p>A Romanesque Church constructed 1145 – 1155. This church burned to the ground in 1194. The tunic  was believed to be lost!</p>
<p>Then, three days later, the tunic was discovered unharmed in the crypt below the church. This was seen as a true miracle!</p>
<p>The interpretation of this event was that Mary wanted to get rid of the old Romanesque style church, so that a Gothic church could be built for her tunic. A new Gothic church was constructed from 1194 – 1220, but the old Romanesque façade remained.</p>
<p>The Gothic era was a hard time to live through. Diseases spread. Wars prevailed. Interest in Mary developed, as Mary became the figure you could appeal to and intercede on your behalf.  There was Marian Devotion or Cult of the Virgin along with increased participation in Church life.</p>

<p><strong>The Bible Moralisée </strong>is an<strong> illuminated manuscript, </strong>made using<strong> ink, tempera, and gold leaf on vellum.  </strong>Vellum fine paper is made from the skin of calves. While <strong>Tempera</strong> is pigment mixed with egg yolk.</p>
<p>The work is typically Gothic in style, with drawings that look almost like stained glass windows. There are strong black outlines, filled with bright colours. The figures are not modeled, and appear very thin, without any muscularity.</p>
<h5><strong>Purpose of</strong> <strong>Bible Moralisée</strong></h5>
<p>This very expensive work was created for French royalty. It illustrates every sentence in the bible with text and additional commentary. This suggests comparisons between people and events in the Biblical world with the medieval world</p>

<p>At the <strong>top left</strong> is <strong>Blanche of Castile</strong>, who is veiled in a white widow’s wimple. The traditional medieval open crown sits on top. This crown is decorated with the fleur-de-lys, a stylized iris that is the French royal flower.</p>
<p>Both pose and expression indicate that she is gesturing and speaking to the young man, her son, Louis IX. This pose was familiar to many as that of the Virgin Mary and Christ, who were often enthroned side by side.</p>

<p>At the <strong>top right</strong> is a young and still beardless <strong>Louis</strong> <strong>IX</strong>. He glances at his mother. In his hand, he holds a sceptre topped with a fleur-de-lys and a small golden ball. The ball is in reference to coronation, and Christ’s dominion over the world.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is from a different Bible Moralisée from the Paris-Oxford-London Bible Moralisée</p>
<p>which is split between those three cities****</p>
<p>Here, lavishly illustrated passages from the Old and New Testaments  were paired with historical and contemporary scenes to convey a moral message. Each page has 8 circular shaped <strong>medallions </strong>arranged in the two columns. Two columns of work are read from the top left to bottom left, then from top right to bottom right.</p>
<p>The two top medallions illustrate the Bible. The two below shows the equivalent for the (then) modern period.  There are a total of 4887 medallions.</p>
<p><strong>This page tells the story</strong> of St. John the Divine’s vision, where an angel takes him on a tour of heaven and shows him everything that will happen until the end of time. There will be an ongoing battle between God and evil, and ultimately God will win.</p>
<h5><strong>Medallion A</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Revelation 14:19</strong>  “<em>And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth, and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God.</em>”</p>
<p>A figure on the right harvests grapes from the vines on the right. Christ, with his cruciform,  cross-shaped halo, pours the grapes from the basket on his back into the winepress. God and his angels bless the scene from above.</p>
<h5><strong>Medallion a</strong></h5>

<p>The <strong>commentary text</strong> says that the great winepress signifies hell. There are demons herding the damned into a hellmouth . Among the damned is a corrupt bishop, identified by his hat, or <strong>mitre</strong>, and a corrupt king.</p>
<h5><strong>Medallion B</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-637" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/61-Medallion-B.jpg?resize=642%2C397&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="642" height="397" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/61-Medallion-B.jpg?w=642&amp;ssl=1 642w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/61-Medallion-B.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Revelation 15:1</strong> “And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels having the seven last plagues. For in them is filled up the wrath of God.”</p>
<p>The illustration shows Christ is on the left with seven angels on the right.</p>
<h5><strong>Medallion b </strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-638" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/61-Medallion-b-1.jpg?resize=500%2C463&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="463" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>commentary text</strong> interprets the seven angels as faithful preachers who teach God’s people. The illustrations show a priest on the left teaching a group of men. Two Jewish men identified with conical hats, turn their body away from the priest.  This was aimed to convince Christian readers that Jews were once God’s people, but medieval Jews no longer were.</p>
<h5><strong>The Apocalypse Revelations</strong></h5>
<p>Apocalypse is last book of the Christian bible, often called Revelations. It details evil being destroyed by God, with the righteous being raised. It also describes the end times.</p>
<p>People in the 13<sup>th</sup> century and High Middle Ages believed that the end times had come. War. Plagues. Violence. As such, the book of revelations became very popular.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Blanche of Castile was the Queen of France and married to Louis VIII. The couple gave birth to Louis IX.  When Louis VIII died from dysentery in 1226, she ruled as regent because Louis IX was just 12 years old. As a woman in power, she was accused on adultery and even murder.</p>
<p>Louis IX grew up to lead the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> crusades. In 1270, he and was canonized as a saint in 1297, by Pope Boniface VIII. He was the only French king ever to be sainted.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-596" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/58.-Extra-Shot.jpg?resize=990%2C653&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="653" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/58.-Extra-Shot.jpg?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/58.-Extra-Shot.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Pilgrimage”</strong></h3>
<p>Romanesque churches were <strong>designed to accommodate pilgrimages and to house and display relics.</strong> These drew visitors from far and wide.  Additionally, pilgrimage churches were designed to warn churchgoers about the dangers of living an unrepentant, sinful life, through church sculpture.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1050-1200 CE)</strong></h5>
<p>The European triumph of Christianity was made clear by several facts.  These included the conversions of Germanic tribes, the Battle of Tours, the expulsion of Muslims in 732, as well as the Crusades in 1095.</p>
<p><strong>Urban migration</strong> increased trade and the arts began to flourish.</p>
<p>The power of Church increased. The Petrine theory established that Christ bestowed keys upon Peter. Therefore, popes were spiritual descendants of Peter.</p>
<p>There was papal power over state power, with the threat is excommunication.</p>
<p>During the <strong>11<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> centuries</strong> there was  an explosion of <strong>construction.</strong>  Many of these churches were destroyed by Germanic invasions and wars.</p>
<p>Raoul Glaber, a monk of the period noted, &#8220;It was as though the world had shaken herself and cast off her rags, wishing to clothe herself in a beautiful white robe of churches.”</p>
<p><strong>The</strong><strong> pilgrimage movement</strong> began during this time. Shrines were established along the roads, as well as inns. Pilgrims were practicing the act of contrition or searching for a cure for illness.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations: Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>The word <strong>“Romanesque”</strong> was coined by 19<sup>th</sup>-century art historians, who noticed the structures built entirely of stone, were a Roman revival of sorts. The revitalization of large-scale architecture was caused by pilgrimages across Europe. Patrons were the Church and the wealthy, elite.</p>
<p>Churches took hundreds of years to build and were extremely expensive. Master builders watched over the build of the architecture.</p>
<p>There was a <strong>fear of the buildings burning down</strong>. This resulted in stone roof tops. Theses heavy structures put strain on the foundation. Solid, thick round arches were used.  To keep the full support network, windows could not be cut out. This kept churches dark.</p>
<p>Church design were <strong>altered to accommodate pilgrims</strong> coming in to look at relics. The goal be able to allow church goers to enjoy the services without disruption.</p>
<p>Some of the innovations at this time included <strong>rib vault, bay,</strong> and <strong>ambulatory</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Painting </strong></h5>
<p>The painting of manuscripts continued. Figures were heavily outlined in black. Both gestures and emotions were exaggerated.</p>

<h5><strong>Relic + Journey = Spiritual Experience</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>three greatest pilgrimage destinations in the Christian world during this period were Jerusalem, Rome, and the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northeastern Spain</strong>, which claimed the relics of the apostle St. James, who was credited for assisting in Spain’s defeat of the Muslim invaders of the 8th century.</p>
<p>Christians began pilgrimages to visit the site of St. James’s relics and pray at his church. Four main pilgrimage routes developed from locations in France, all converging on Santiago de Compostela.</p>
<p><strong>The Crusades (1095–1271 C.E.)</strong> defined the era. Pope Urban II was greatly angered that the Christian shrines of the Holy Land were under Muslim control and, therefore, inhibited pilgrimages to these sites.</p>
<p>In a speech given in 1095 C.E., he preached the need to wage a &#8220;Holy War&#8221; and reclaim control of Jerusalem. With the First Crusade, Christians claimed control of Jerusalem. Before the last Crusades were over, however, Muslim general Saladin marshaled command over Jerusalem again.</p>
<h5><strong>Anatomy of a Church</strong></h5>
<p>Churches sprang up along these pilgrimage routes, often boasting their own relics. Most churches used new masonry vaulting techniques, including the use of stone and wood, and employed a distinct floor plan in which apse areas housed relics. These relics defined their function as a pilgrimage destination.</p>
<p>The basic form of the pilgrimage church originated from the early Christian Basilica, Romanesque masons elaborated on this model with:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy, masonry ceilings</li>
<li>rounded arches</li>
<li>architectural sculpture in the tympanums</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan for the <strong>Basilica of St. Sernin in Toulouse, France</strong>, is typical of pilgrimage churches of the Romanesque period. The square of the church&#8217;s crossing served as the geometric basis for the rest of its precisely constructed plan. The nave bays were half the size of the crossing square, and the bays in the aisles were one quarter of a square.</p>

<h5><strong>Destination Pilgrimage</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Cluny III</strong></h5>
<p>Duke William of Aquitaine donated land to the <strong>Benedictines</strong>, creating a monastic order subject only to the pope, in 909 C.E. These monks, based at Cluny, France, became a major cultural, spiritual, and economic power.</p>
<p>The Cluniacs built <strong>Cluny III</strong>, an enormous and elaborately decorated Romanesque central abbey church in Saône-et-Loire, France.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cluniacs’ believed a <strong>lavishly decorated</strong> church was appropriate for communicating Christian doctrine and glorifying God.</p>
<p><strong>Cluny III Abbey</strong>, a pilgrimage church, <strong>was built three times</strong>, each on the same location and an expansion of the previous structure. Alfonso VI, the King of Spain, gave 10,000 talents and enough money to cover half the cost of the Cluny III construction project. Much of the structure was torn down during the French Revolution, the <strong>bell and clock towers were the only original elements that remained</strong>.</p>
<p>With the reintroduction of heavy masonry ceilings, Romanesque architects increasingly found ways to lighten structures and allow more light into the interior. <strong>Cluny III</strong> was the first church to build full-scale double transepts in the chevet, incorporate pointed arches, and the Córdoban horseshoe lobes on arches.</p>
<p>This <strong>Moorish influence was due to an influx of Spanish artisans from Alfonso VI&#8217;s court</strong>. The use of the <strong>pointed arch in the nave is rare in Romanesque architecture but dominant in Gothic architecture</strong>. These innovations allow for less stone and increased windows to allow more light in the interior.</p>
<h5><strong>All About the Architectural Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>Architectural sculpture is a hallmark of the <strong>Romanesque era</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Modena Cathedral</strong></h5>
<p>Few sculptors&#8217; names from either the medieval or the Romanesque period are known with certainty. Wiligelmus, however, inscribed his name on a dedication stone set into the western façade of the <strong>Modena Cathedral</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Modena was a principal Italian Romanesque church in the 11th and 12th centuries.</strong> The western façade of the <strong>Modena Cathedral</strong> is <strong>decorated with four friezes</strong>. The four panels, each with a carved frame, originally formed one continuous frieze to <strong>tell the story of Genesis</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Creation and Fall</em>, Relief panel on Modena Cathedral</strong></p>
<p><strong>Western façade of the Modena Cathedral. Stone frieze panels highlighted. Modena, Italy. Built ca. 1099 C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>first panel depicts</strong> the Creation and Fall of Man. The panel <strong>reads left to right</strong>. God the Father is robed. Adam and Eve are shown naked, and then shown embarrassed by their sin and hidden behind fig leaves.</p>
<p>There is great variety in depth of relief in Wiligelmus&#8217; work. Adam&#8217;s leg is carved in the round, creating highlight and shadow, while columns in the background are sculpted in bas-relief.</p>
<p>The narrative used in the <strong>Modena Cathedral</strong> inspired the use of narrative, and this form of storytelling through sculpted portals became an established practice across Europe to teach morals and Bible stories.</p>
<h5><strong>Saint-Pierre Cathedral</strong></h5>
<p>Stone relief sculpture also inhabited the tympanum, the semicircular panel centered above the double doors. Like the trumeau, the tympanum at <strong>Saint-Pierre Cathedral</strong> is in the church&#8217;s deeply recessed southern porch.</p>
<p>The theme of this <strong>tympanum—God&#8217;s righteousness as Final Judge</strong>—is from the New Testament Book of Revelation. The portal sculpture displays the crowned King of All Kings in hierarchical scale; Christ is larger and more intense than the other figures. Each figure&#8217;s size and location connote their relative importance.</p>
<p>For example, twisting in figure eights around Christ are the four beasts of the Apocalypse, waiting under his direction to be unleashed. Two tall angels round out the central composition.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>Finally, filling the space away from the central figures are 24 elders. These much smaller figures look like stars surrounding Christ. They carry chalices and play musical instruments in worship. The masses of pilgrims entering this church would contemplate the meaning of the monumental sculpture. The tympanum showed the preeminence of Christ and was meant to motivate Christian believers to live out their faith, including living a moral life and giving to the church.</p>

<p>The <strong>stone</strong> church was built so that pilgrims could easily journey through.  They approach the exterior and at <strong>portal</strong> and view the <strong>tympanum. </strong>Entering the door under the right-hand of the  <strong>tympanum</strong> , looking  toward the <strong>nave, </strong>they would walk down the <strong>side aisles</strong>. Next, they would move along the <strong>transept</strong>, and into the <strong>radiating chapels</strong> that rotate around the back of the <strong>altar</strong> in the <strong>apsidal end</strong> of the church.</p>

<p>Basilicas can accommodate lots of people and they have a central focus. <strong>Church of Sainte-Foy </strong> needed to develop a space that could accommodate both church services and pilgrims visiting without disruption to church goers.</p>
<p>A transept was the solution. It enabled pilgrims to move in an out of the church by moving them around the service and behind the alter.</p>
<p>The bonus of this floor plan is that it resembles a cross.</p>
<h5><strong>Romanesque Characteristics</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Church of Sainte-Foy </strong>has taller arches. To keep these arches and walls upright, the walls had to be made very thick to pinch the arch upwards. To keep the structures of the wall intact, windows were eliminated. The walls could not bear a clerestory.</p>
<p>From the nave view there is a <strong>barrel vault</strong> with <strong>transept arches</strong>, and a <strong>nave arcade</strong>. Notice the <strong>bays.</strong></p>
<p>The exterior decoration is minimal. The <strong>westwork </strong>façade has two bell towers.</p>
<h5><strong>The Function of Church of Sainte-Foy</strong></h5>
<p>Church of Sainte-Foy functioned to host pilgrims on their journey to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. It worked to bless the visitors and help them be saved on Judgement Day. Christians were inspired to behave in a holy manner and to show their piety.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Sainte-Foy?</strong></h5>
<p>Sainte Foy (English: Saint Faith) was born in the French/Roman 2<sup>nd</sup> century city of Agen. She became a martyr when she was killed by the Romans by refusing to worship pagan gods. She was only 12 years old.</p>
<p>Her skull became the relic that pilgrims wanted to visit. It was believed that it cured blindness.</p>

<p><strong>Reliquary of Sainte Foy</strong> is a seated sculpture of Sainte Foy that is just over 3 feet tall. The wooden core is gilded with gold, and studded with gems (amethyst, crystal, emeralds, garnets, jade, onyx, opal, pearls, rubies, sapphires, topaz) Many off these gems were offerings made at the church.</p>
<p>The head of the Reliquary was originally from a Roman statue <strong>(spoila)</strong>. Inside rests Sainte Foy’s skull. The head is made up a different gold from the body. The crown and head were added during the 11<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h5><strong>History of the Skull</strong></h5>
<p>The skull was originally at a monastery in Agen but monks from Conques stole it to attract wealth and visitors.</p>
<p>It is first mentioned in written history in 1010 by Bernard of Angers. He worried it would inspire Idolatry because of it was so expensive and precious.</p>

<p><strong>Tympanum</strong> is semicircular area for decoration directly over the door of a church. <strong>Jamb </strong>and <strong>jamb figures</strong> are side posts of doorways or figures carved on columns.   There are 124 figures here.</p>
<p>Tympanum decoration helped viewers understand the theme of the building. It was carved in relief  and was once painted to help viewers read it.  Scene was to help remind viewers of the joys of heaven and the torments of hell.</p>

<p>On the <strong>left side</strong> or Christ’s right side is the door to Heaven.  This is the side that pilgrims EXIT under. Immediately on Christ’s right are Mary, Peter, the founder of the monastery and other saints. The hand of God points to St. Foy who bows to God.</p>
<p>At the <strong>bottom left</strong> is the House of Paradise (arcade with pediment), which holds the saved. Abraham sits crowned in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>In the center</strong> sits Christ enthroned as judge. The entire figure is encircled by a <strong>mandorla </strong>or frame<strong>. </strong>He<strong>  </strong>sits with his right hand pointing upwards on the side of the saved.  His left-hand gestures down to the damned, who will be sent to hell.</p>
<p>Below this is the Archangel Michael and the Devil, weighing souls. Underneath that is the door to Heaven and Hell with a monster guarding Hell.</p>
<p>To the <strong>right side </strong>or Christ’s left side is Hell. This is the side that pilgrims enter under. This is a reminder that everyone who enters is a sinner.</p>
<p>On the <strong>bottom right</strong> is the Devil crowned and enthroned, who is mocking Christ.  To the devil’s left is a hanged man. This represents Judas who hanged himself after betraying Christ. The damned encircle him, each represents a specific sin. The dead rise from their tombs.</p>
<p>Hell is chaotic, disorderly, very different from the side of Heaven. The lintel read,  “O Sinners, change your morals before you might face a cruel judgment.”</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Reference</strong></h5>
<p>The town of Conques became an important stop on the route to Santiago de Compostela, in Northern Spain. This was the final destination of all pilgrims because it contains the relic of St. James.</p>
<h5><strong>Relics as Religious Objects</strong></h5>
<p>Relics are <strong>objects of religious significance</strong>. Some Christian examples directly associated with Christ’s life include, the manger, the cross and Mary’s clothing. Then, there are physical remains of saints such as teeth, feet, or skulls. Additionally, anything the saint may have touched was also considered a relic, like clothing or a bible.</p>
<p>It was <strong>believed that relics induced miracles</strong>. They could cure sickness, sop famine or plagues. This created a commerce market for relics. Forgeries abounded. So many people were selling pieces of the True Cross, that John Calvin famously remarked that you could build a ship with them.</p>
<p>Reliquaries developed as ways to protect and display relics. Since relics were valuable , they were enshrined in containers that were decorated with precious metals and precious and semi precious stones.</p>
<p>Churches were <strong>built along major pilgrimage roads</strong> to welcome pilgrims and show them relics—both real and forged. <strong>Relics</strong> became a <strong>source of income for the church</strong>, as people made offerings. It also helped <strong>support the town</strong> in was the church was in <strong>with tourism trade</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, every October, there is still a festival in Conques and the region of Southern France that celebrates Sainte Foy.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Bayeux Museum. Normandy, France.</p>
<p>Entitling this work <strong><em>Bayeux Tapestry</em></strong> is a misnomer, as it is not a tapestry at all! This is an extraordinarily large <strong>embroidery using wool, on linen,  </strong>and measuring <strong>20 feet high  by 230 feet wide.</strong></p>
<p>Executed by women, it has been often attributed to William the Conqueror’s wife, <strong>Mathilde of France</strong>.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon needlework is of very high quality. Here, historians are not sure if the work is English or Norman (France).</p>
<p>The tapestry is organized to lead the viewer’s eye from scene to scene and divided into three compositional zones or registers. It has a neutral background devoid of shadows or negative space. The colour is not naturalistic.</p>
<p>The bodies lack modeling and are highly stylized and elongated. There is a lack of perspective and definition of space.</p>
<h5><strong>The Function of the Embroidered Work</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Bayeux Tapestry</em></strong>, was Commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror. He was crowned a Duke by his brother.</p>
<p>The work was a testimony to Norman (French) glory over the Anglo-Saxons (English) and shows</p>
<p>William’s conquest of Harold Godwinson.  The tapestry was displayed at Bayeux Cathedral, and likely hung in one of the dining halls, given the size and subject matter.</p>
<h5><strong>The Storyline</strong></h5>
<p>This work tells the story in Latin of the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and William the Conqueror’s conquest of the Anglo-Saxons in England led by Harold Godwinson.</p>
<p>Within the embroidery there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>58 scenes in total that are told from the French/Norman perspective</li>
<li>Over 600 people, but only three women!</li>
<li>Conquest is shown as fully justified</li>
<li>Harold is portrayed negatively as an opportunist who broke his oath to Edward the Confessor, the former king of England</li>
<li>Upper register/lower register contains animals, beasts, people, hunting scenes</li>
<li>Figures are generally calm, stoic, successful</li>
</ul>

<p>This section shows the strength of the Norman formation. The soldiers are covered with accurate armour and protected by helmets and shields.</p>
<p>Horsemen used stirrups which enabled them to strike without being thrown by the impact. Cavalry wore conical steel helmets, with protective nose plates, chainmail shirts, and carried spears and axes. Mortally wounded men and horses are strewn along the embroidered fabric.</p>

<h5><strong>About William</strong></h5>
<p>William the Conqueror was originally named William the Bastard. He was the illegitimate son of Robert the Magnificent and Herleva of Falaise. His name change came with military successes.</p>
<h5><strong>The Calvary</strong></h5>
<p><strong>William the Conqueror won the war because of the horsemen. </strong>Cavalries could advance quickly and then retreat to avoid danger. This would often scatter an opponent’s defenses.</p>
<p>In the case of the Saxon’s, their lines began to fragment.  Norman cavalry penetrated easily and killed Harold Godwinson.  He was first struck in the eye with an arrow, then run through with swords.</p>

<h3><strong>Theme: “Illumination”</strong></h3>
<p>In a deeply Christian society, Western Europe searched for <strong>illumination</strong> through reading the Biblical text. Artists <strong>illuminated </strong>the pages with vibrant colors to lend importance to Biblical manuscripts.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Points (500-1050 CE)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Migrations of Germanic peoples into the territory north of the Roman Empire was pushed westward by the Huns.</li>
<li>Feudalism was the relationship between lord and vassal.</li>
<li>Church was the only major institution to survive the collapse of West Rome.</li>
<li>Christianization of the Germanic tribes.</li>
<li><strong>Merovingians </strong>or <strong>Franks </strong>ruled France and Germany from 5<sup>th</sup> – 8<sup>th</sup></li>
<li><strong>Hiberno-Saxons</strong> 6<sup>th</sup>-11<sup>th</sup> centuries were in the British Isles.</li>
<li><strong>Carolingians </strong>(800-876: France and Germany)
<ul>
<li>Group of Franks, led by Charlemagne (King of Franks: 768-800; Holy Roman Emperor: 800-814)</li>
<li>Charlemagne unifies feudal kingdoms together in Western Europe to be the Carolingian Empire, with the capital in Aachen, Germany</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ottonian Period (919-1024: Germany)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>earliest of medieval artworks were mostly portable</strong>, given migratory patterns of the people. As for <strong>patronage</strong>, monasteries had monks who are literate and could dry. Monks copied works from old texts, like the bible, instead of contemporary tales.</p>
<p><strong>Paintings</strong> appeared in manuscripts on either parchment or vellum. The pages were covered in wood or leather to create books.</p>
<p>As for <strong>architecture</strong>, churches, and chapels, to accommodate church goers were inspired by Rome.</p>
<h5><strong>Early Medieval Sites in Europe</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Merovingian Art</strong></h5>
<p>This art was created by the <strong>Frankish dynasty</strong> who ruled France, Germany, northern Italy, Switzerland, or the area known as <strong>ancient Gaul</strong>. It was a Christian empire. The rulers used Christianity to their advantage to craft alliances. The art inspired by pagan and barbarian art forms originating during the Roman period.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Musee des Antiquities Nationales in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France</p>
<p><strong><em>Merovingian looped fibulae </em></strong>are a beautiful example of <strong>decorative arts</strong> in early medieval Europe. This piece is comprised of <strong>silver gilt worked in filigree with inlays of garnets and other stones</strong>. These are a pair of broaches (fibula would be the singular) that are each 4 inches long.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Decorative Art?</strong></h5>
<p>Decorative arts fall under the category of Fine Arts&#8212; includes sculpture, painting, and architecture. Decorative arts are beautiful utilitarian objects. Think clocks, jewelry, vases, tea pots, and furniture.</p>
<h5><strong>Methods Used to Create this Jewelry </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chase</strong> metal or shape it by hammering. Other examples of <strong>chasing</strong> include indenting to ornament metal.</li>
<li><strong>Filigree</strong> metal into delicate shapes.</li>
<li><strong>Gild</strong> the work with silver or cover the metal with silver. This is an example of silver gilt, but pieces can also be done in gold.</li>
<li><strong>Cloisonné</strong> work using small wires to make little cups.<strong> Cloisonné</strong> was a popular technique in early Medieval art. The term means “partitioned” in French. Artists would attach wires onto a metal base to create various shapes. Then stones were placed in these shapes</li>
<li>Finish <strong>cloisonné</strong> by inlaying the garnets and other stones.</li>
<li>Attach pin on the back.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Made Popular by Roman Soldiers</strong></h5>
<p>These pieces of decorative art jewelry have a <strong>utilitarian purpose</strong>. Before buttons existed, they were used  to fasten garments, such as cloaks and capes.  Wearing A fibula (fib-you-luh) or fibulae(fib-you-lay) was a status symbol. Later pieces were used as a sign of the Christian faith.</p>
<h5><strong>Examining the Jewelry Up Close </strong></h5>
<p>This style of fibulae was called a crossbow because it resembled the weapon.</p>
<p>The side of an eagle’s head appears on these pieces. Eagles were originally a Greek/Roman symbol of Zeus/Jupiter. Later these birds were used to reference Saint John. <strong>Garnets</strong>, red semi precious stones makeup the eyes of the eagles.</p>
<p>The fish are in reference to Christ’s miracle of loaves and fishes, when he created enough to feed hundreds.</p>
<p>These fibulae had another use. At the bottom of each is a small loop, so the jewelry could also be worn as pendants.</p>
<h5><strong>Who were the</strong> <strong>Merovingians</strong>?</h5>
<p>The Merovingians were a barbarian group who ruled a large part of France and northern Spain.</p>
<p>Part of the <strong>Art of the Migration</strong> period that was produced by Barbarians from 300-900 CE, this art became increasingly more Christian as barbarians adopted the religion.</p>
<p>Fibulae were originally pins used by Roman military members. Barbarians later followed this example. These pieces of jewelry were commonly found in barbarian grave sites.  The <strong><em>Merovingian looped fibulae</em></strong> were found in the grave of a wealthy Merovingian woman in Spain.</p>
<p>Little documentation exists about Barbarians, so these works provide some of the only concrete evidence. It reveals proficiency and skill of barbarian metal workers.</p>
<h5><strong>Hiberno-Saxon Art</strong></h5>
<p>This was the art of the British Isles in the Early Medieval period. <strong>Hibernia</strong> is an ancient name for Ireland. <strong>Saxon </strong>was the Germanic tribes in Great Britain. Hiberno-Saxon art flourished in monasteries through illuminated manuscripts. Prevalent were interlacing patterns, stylized animal, and horror vacui, or using every space on the page.</p>
<p>In 432, St. Patrick established a church in Ireland.  He began the Christianization of the Celts on the remote island that had never known Roman rule.</p>

<p><strong>Museum: </strong>British Library</p>
<p>Lindisfarne Gospels, is a <strong>codex</strong> or bound book, <strong>illuminated manuscript, measuring 13 inches tall</strong>. The book is made from <strong>vellum</strong>, meaning calf skins. This was used for <strong>130 pages in total</strong>. <strong>Ink , as well as various pigments and gold were used.  </strong></p>
<p>The book is written in Latin.  A monk used a goose quill, dipped in black ink to write with. The work was completed in a scriptorium or the rooms in monasteries where monks worked on books.  Gold leaf, applied in flakes, is reflective.</p>
<p>This book created in <strong>Lindisfarne, a small island off the coast of Scotland</strong>, is considered a masterpiece of <strong>Insular culture</strong> which refers to the islands of <strong>Britain and Ireland</strong>. It blends components from Celtic Germanic and Mediterranean cultures, through text, calligraphy, and art.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong> translated into Greek is “<em>fear of empty space</em>”. In art terms, this means the artist filled up every space with detail.</p>
<h5><strong>Styling the Manuscript</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Various styles were used throughout the manuscript. On the pages on St. Matthew the viewer finds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animal style</strong>: art form in which animals are depicted in a stylized and complicated form and pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Zoomorphic:</strong> based on animal shapes and specifically in this case snakes.</li>
<li>Interlacing: complex and repetitive knots, spirals, and tightly twisted lines</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Why this Manuscript was Made</strong></h5>
<p>Monks made Bibles as an exercise in patience and devotion, as well as to honor God. Once completed, it was used to aid in devotion and prayer. Interlacing and vibrant colors are meant to incite meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels</strong> was made to honor the relics of St. Cuthbert, the saint whose bones were on site.</p>

<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2 : St. Luke portrait page</strong></h5>
<p>Here, curly-haired St. Luke sits on a red-cushioned stool, against an unornamented background. His divinity is represented by a gold halo. Holding a quill in his right hand, about to write on a scroll, he is relaxed with his legs and feet stretched out.  A blue-winged ox clasps the Bible. This creature is a symbol of Luke.</p>
<figure id="attachment_509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-509" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-509" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/55-St-Luke-portrait-page.jpg?resize=500%2C687&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="687" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/55-St-Luke-portrait-page.jpg?w=241&amp;ssl=1 241w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/55-St-Luke-portrait-page.jpg?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1 218w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-509" class="wp-caption-text">St. Luke portrait page<br />© British Library Board/Robana/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the St. Luke Portrait,  the figure is greatly simplified. At this point, the knowledge of Greco-Roman naturalism and idealism is lost. There is no understanding of perspective, foreshortening or recession. There is an undefined space and unclear weight of figures.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 3: St. Luke incipit page</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_510" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-510" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-510" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/55-St-Luke-incipit-page.jpg?resize=500%2C706&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="706" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/55-St-Luke-incipit-page.jpg?w=233&amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/55-St-Luke-incipit-page.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-510" class="wp-caption-text">St. Luke incipit page<br />© Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The word “incipit” translates into “it begins”. Snakes move within the letter.</p>
<p>A Large Q begins the text that reads <em>“Quoniam quidem multi conati sunt ordinare narrtionem</em>.” This means,  “<em>As many have taken it in hand to set forth in order…”</em></p>
<p>The border on the righthand side terminates in a cat shape. Birds and snakes are present.</p>
<h5><strong>Art and Hiberno Saxon Culture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels is an Early Medieval (Hiberno Saxon) hand made manuscript</strong>.</p>
<p><strong> Hibernia</strong> is Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>Saxon</strong> means Germanic tribes in Great Britain.</p>
<p><strong>Hiberno-Saxon</strong> means Irish and Germanic culture in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Hiberno Saxon art flourished in monasteries. These communities were deeply Christian. Monasticism was extremely popular and an increasingly growing Christian practice. It involved the removal of oneself from daily life and distractions and pleasures. It was thought that it was better to live a difficult life so you could understand how good life was.</p>
<p>Historically, we know a lot about this oldest surviving Bible in English, because of the colophon or statement at the end of the book describes the author. It was made by a monk Eadfrith. He  eventually became the Bishop.</p>
<p>Usually, a team of monks would work on a book, but Eadfrith completed this himself. He died before completing it, which is why some of the book remains unfinished.</p>

<h3><strong>Theme:  “The Four Fs”</strong></h3>
<p>This theme focuses on the basic characteristics of Byzantine figural representation.  The “Four Fs” stand for <strong>formal, flat, frontal</strong>, and <strong>floating</strong>. The word “floating” refers to the ways the bodies in Byzantine mosaics and paintings seem to hover, appearing weightless.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Byzantine Art (527 – 1453)</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 324</strong>, Constantine I founded the city Constantinople on the site of the ancient city of Byzantium to serve as the new capital of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The <strong>8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> centuries</strong> brought the <strong>Iconoclastic Controversy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In 1204</strong>, Western Crusaders conquered Constantinople. They were eventually expelled but took artwork with them to Western Europe.</p>
<p><strong>In 1453</strong>, they were conquered by Ottomans. The Empire spoke Greek and practiced Orthodox Christianity. Religion spread throughout Eastern Europe. Justinian proclaimed Christianity to be the only <em>lawful</em> religion. Pagan cults had mostly died out.</p>
<p>Constantinople was a glittering, wealthy, opulent city. Emperor was the earthly vicar of Christ with spiritual authority. The Orthodox Church and Byzantine court mirrored the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Early Byzantine Art (527-730)</strong></h5>
<p>Almost all the works from this period were lost due to iconoclasts.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconoclastic Controversy (700 – 843)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Iconoclasm</strong> was the destruction of images used in religious worship. The worship of idols was considered sacrilegious. The emperor banned all image production and iconoclasts smashed all religious figural images.</p>
<h5><strong>Middle Byzantine Art (843 – 1204)</strong></h5>
<p>Iconoclasm was repealed.</p>
<h5><strong>Late Byzantine Art (1204-1453)</strong></h5>
<p>Most works commissioned from Byzantine church and state were luxury objects for the court. <strong>Painting </strong>specialized in icons, manuscripts, and mosaics, with a combination of a classical style and a more formal, flat medieval style.</p>
<p><strong>Sculpture </strong>was smaller in scale and made mostly from <strong>ivories</strong> and <strong>precious metals</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> was pendentive and squinch.</p>

<p><strong>Hagia Sophia</strong>, was built in <strong>Constantinople, Turkey</strong>, in what today is <strong>Istanbul</strong>.  The structure uniquely combines <strong>a basilica</strong> structure measuring <strong>240 by 240 feet</strong>, with <strong>an enormous dome</strong> measuring <strong>108 feet</strong> tall. The architecture was created using <strong>brick, ceramic elements, stone, and mosaic veneer</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>Architectural Planning</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-563" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52-Drwaing-2.jpg?resize=562%2C666&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="562" height="666" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52-Drwaing-2.jpg?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52-Drwaing-2.jpg?resize=253%2C300&amp;ssl=1 253w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The central plan has a hemispherical dome placed onto a square base. The basilica plan was created by adding a narthex and lengthening the building on one side so that it is no longer a square.</p>
<p>The dome was not made of concrete like the Romans typically designed. The <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> architects used four <strong>pendentives</strong> to transfer the weight from the great dome to the piers beneath, rather than the walls.  <strong>Pendentives</strong> are curved triangle vaulting formed by the intersection of a dome, with supporting arches.</p>
<p><strong>Spolia</strong> or repurposed marble columns from Rome were incorporated.</p>
<h5><strong>Letting the Light In</strong></h5>
<p>There are <strong>40 closely set windows</strong> that were cut at the base of the dome. When viewed it appears that the dome is being supported by a radius of light. The windows were framed with highly polished mosaic pieces, lending to the quality of light.</p>

<h5><strong>Interior Decorative Elements</strong></h5>
<p>Imported <strong>marble </strong>with large, colorful, veins line the floors and walls, creating great movement and energy.</p>
<p>Stone that was not marble was once d<strong>ecorated in mosaic patterns of acanthus leaves, palm leaves and crosses.</strong> This would have heightened the opulence and added a reflective quality.</p>
<h5><strong>The History of the Space</strong></h5>
<p>Constantine built a church here that was burned down in a fire.  Justinian admired Constantine and felt drawn to their similarities. Both were Christian emperors. Justinian in fact was the greatest emperor of the Byzantine empire.</p>
<p>Justinian decided to rebuild the church after claiming to see the finished building appear to him in a dream. His biggest concern was building a fireproof church!</p>
<p><strong>Hagia Sophia </strong>was a symbol of Byzantine superiority over the Pantheon and pagan Rome through art and culture.</p>
<p>The name of the church means Saint Sophia. The word Sophia wisdom or Church of Holy Wisdom. It was later converted to a mosque, in 1453 (<strong>appropriation</strong>) and the Ottoman conquest. Then, the minarets and calligraphic roundels were added.  The roundels say the names of Muhammad, Allah, and the close family members of Muhammad.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Timelines in Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong>324:</strong> Constantine founded Constantinople as the new capital of Rome.</p>
<p><strong>476:</strong> Fall of Western Rome and definite split of the two empires. Byzantines remain strong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Justinian, following the lead of Constantine, proclaimed Christianity to be the only lawful religion.</li>
<li>Constantine’s Edict of Milan declared that Christianity was a tolerated religion</li>
<li>Justinian expanded borders of his empire.</li>
<li>Justinian defined Byzantine art, literature, Greek Orthodox dogma</li>
<li>Architects were mathematicians. They were able to pull off the largest dome ever constructed at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1453:</strong> Minarets were added by the Ottomans to be a mosque after the conquest by Sultan Mehmed II</p>
<h5><strong>About the Architects</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Isidorus of Miletus</strong> was born in Miletus during the 6<sup>th</sup> century. He was a scholar and an architect who founded an engineering school in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p><strong>Anthemius of Tralles</strong> was a writer and architect, who taught geometry at the University of Constantine.</p>
<p>Both men had been students of the famous mathematician Proclus. Both had successful careers as architects, individually, before Emperor Justinian heard about them.</p>

<p><strong>San Vitale</strong> is a church in <strong>Ravenna, Italy</strong>, made from <strong>marble and stone veneer. </strong>It is also known for its magnificent <strong>mosaics</strong>. The central plan is symbolic of unity, continuity,  and timelessness. The brick of the austere exterior was taken from ancient Roman (<strong>spolia</strong>) and repurposed here.</p>
<p>This is the surviving church from Justinian’s era that is virtually unchanged.</p>
<h5><strong>The Narthex </strong></h5>
<p>The<strong> Narthex</strong>, or entrance to the church was as far as non-baptized people could go. It has an odd angle, which has never been explained. Historians think it may have been an attempt to symbolically disorient the viewer and make them seek out the altar by re-orienting themselves. Another theory is that it may have been constructed in this manner to highlight the transition from the material world to the spiritual one.</p>
<h5><strong>Walking Inside</strong></h5>

<p>The interior is bright, illuminated, and opulent continuing in the  tradition of beautiful interior to symbolize a beautiful soul. The use of <strong>triple arcades</strong> references the trinity.</p>
<p>The church is centrally planned so that focus is on the center, instead of a basilica plan with the focus on the apse.  <strong>San Vitale</strong> consists of two concentric octagons. The smaller octagon inside, with a <strong>drum </strong>raises the dome higher to allow in light. The drum is mixed with windows in a kind of clerestory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-571" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52-Drwaing-2-1.jpg?resize=562%2C666&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="562" height="666" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52-Drwaing-2-1.jpg?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52-Drwaing-2-1.jpg?resize=253%2C300&amp;ssl=1 253w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-504" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/51-San-Vitale-Plan.png?resize=292%2C363&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="292" height="363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/51-San-Vitale-Plan.png?w=292&amp;ssl=1 292w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/51-San-Vitale-Plan.png?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1 241w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>How do you take a circle shaped dome and place it on top of an octagon? It is done with <strong>squinches.</strong> This is simply a wedge that fits into corners of a space.</p>
<p>Capitals of columns are called <strong>impost blocks</strong>, or inverted pyramids. The Classical orders are left behind. This is a result of Christians turning away from pagan Greco-Roman precedents.</p>
<p>The bottom floor has an <strong>ambulatory</strong> or an aisle for walking around the church in a circular fashion. The second floor has a <strong>gallery</strong> and an ambulatory that was reserved for women.</p>
<p>The apse is extended slightly to one side. The alter was placed here so everyone could see the priest.</p>
<p><strong>Interior of dome and squinches. The ceiling was painted in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Cross-cultural Influences</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>San Vitale </strong>is a<strong> Byzantine church </strong>for the Greek Orthodox religion. While it shows <strong>Early Christian</strong> influence with new Christian iconography and culture, it also has a <strong>Roman</strong> influence, with a dome similar to the Pantheon.</p>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Propaganda for Justinian</strong></h5>
<p><strong>San Vitale</strong> was political propaganda for Justinian, to display his power in Ravenna, Italy. This newly conquered region was a place he has never visited. It displayed the opulence and wealth of Byzantines, and their leader. The church also imposed the Byzantine tradition of Greek Orthodoxy, in this area of Italy.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Martyrium?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Martyrium</strong> is a shrine built over a place where a saint is martyred or buried. This is a <strong>martyrium</strong> to Saint Vitalis</p>

<li>Bishop Ecclesius.</li>
</ul>
<p>Christ, dressed in imperial purple and seated on an orb signifies universal dominion. He offers the crown of martyrdom to Saint Vitalis. Four Rivers of Paradise sit underneath him with rainbow clouds above. Extending a gold wreath of victory to Saint Vitalis, patron saint of the church, with the other hand he holds the book of Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Vitalis reaches for the crown with his hands covered in cloth, as is Byzantine court ceremony. He is a soldier, and this is signified by the boots he wears.  Bishop Ecclesius holds the model of the church.</p>
<h5><strong>Above the Altar</strong></h5>
<p>The lamb of God wears a halo as Christ is depicted as sacrificial lamb, surrounded by wreath of victory. This is the success of Christianity itself.</p>

<p>This mosaic work is located on the north wall next to altar in the apse. It is <strong>formal</strong>, relating to religion and politics. Yet, classical naturalism has been left out of this work.</p>
<p>The images have a serious nature. The space is gold to show they are of a higher realm. This makes it look <strong>flat </strong>and the view is <strong>frontal.</strong> The images appear to be <strong>floating. </strong>Their feet are oddly angled, as if non-weigh bearing.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of this Mosaic</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>The main theme of this mosaic is the authority of the emperor in the Christian plan of history.  The prominent location, next to the altar, shows the importance of Justinian.  He has religious,  administrative, and  military authority.</p>
<h5><strong>What this Mosaic Shows the Viewer </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Justinian is shown participating in the Eucharist /communion ceremony. He is  holding the bread which has transubstantiated into the body of Christ. It is on a plate called <strong>paten </strong>that is used only for bread during Eucharist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Justinian stands at the center, represented as a priest-king.</li>
<li>Halo shows the divine origin of his authority.</li>
<li>He wears crown and purple robe, the symbol of divinity.</li>
<li>Justinian divides the picture plane into two sides, as he embodies both Church and State.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>left side</strong> represents the state. Soldiers on far left are generic and lack individuality. They have shields with Chi-Rho, the first two letters of Christ’s name in Latin. Dressed in white with purple stripes are the men of the Imperial administration. The beardless figure is the court eunuch.  Figure on right is Belisarius.</p>
<p>The <strong>right side</strong> of the mosaic represents the Church. Featured here is Julius Argentius, the principal benefactor of the Church and Bishop Maximianus, probably because he played a role in the construction and supervision of church design.</p>
<p>Ambiguity exists in the positioning of Justinian and Maximianus. This overlapping suggests that Justinian is the closest figure to the viewer, and he is central figure. Maximianus’s feet are lower on the picture plane and therefore actually closer to us. Additionally, he is named!</p>
<p>Which figure is more important, Justinian or Maximianus? This has been interpreted as a source of tension between the authority of the Emperor and the church. Justinian has never been to the church and Maximianus oversaw the work on the Mosaic. Was this his way of asserting his own power?</p>
<p>The clergy carry objects for Eucharist, including a censer to burn incense and a gospel book.</p>

<p>This mosaic is positioned on the south wall to the apse and facing Justinian.  Theodora ruled as co-equal to Justinian. She was a powerful woman. This illustrates how both king and queen played an important role.</p>
<p>Theodora appears elaborately robed in purple, with jewelry and a bejewelled crown. This symbolizes the richness of the Byzantines. The halo does not represent her own divinity but that her authority is of divine origin. Here she carries a gold cup, having just participated in the same Eucharist ceremony.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context </strong></h5>
<p><strong>476 CE:</strong> A church was already being built here when the area was under Goth rule</p>
<p><strong>536 CE: </strong>Ravenna now ruled by the Ostrogoths, and church construction began under Bishop Ecclesius. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>539 CE :</strong> Ravenna in Italy was conquered by Justinian’s general Belisarius.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ravenna enjoyed its greatest cultural and economic prosperity during Justinian’s rule</li>
<li>Ravenna, thanks to its control by the Barbarians, believed Christ was the creation of God the Father and was therefore not an equal in the trinity.</li>
<li>Justinian sent his general Belisarius there to capture this area and impose Greek Orthodoxy</li>
<li>Justinian and Theodora <em>never</em> visited Ravenna.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>547 CE:</strong> Bishop Maximianus completed the interior decoration and oversaw the mosaics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Byzantines promoted belief caesaropapism (Caesar over pope) – believing a single political ruler is the head of the church</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> St. Catherine’s Monastery in Sinai, Egypt</p>
<p>This icon painting,  measuring <strong> 2 feet 3 inches by 1 foot 7 inches</strong>,<strong> Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George</strong> uses <strong>encaustic on wood</strong>. Encaustic is a pigment mixed with wax.  The work is formal and both religious and political in nature.</p>
<p>As is the norm in Byzantine icons, the figures are highly contoured, and the faces are <strong>modeled</strong> with light and shadow to show roundness. The figures are frontal and almost rigid, yet the angels do turn their heads. The two figures in the front are floating and do not support their weight.</p>
<p>The space is shallow, and background details are vague. There is however some spatial recession with shadows on the throne.</p>
<h5><strong>What is an Icon?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Icon </strong>is the Greek word for image. An icon painting is for personal devotion and worship. Icons were believed to be the religious figures depicted. The steady gaze of the images encouraged a personal connection for the worshipper.</p>
<p>The purpose is not to be visually accurate, but rather to convey religious meaning and facilitate a religious experience.</p>
<h5><strong>The Figures in the Icon Painting</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The Virgin (Theotokos)</strong> is the Greek title for mother of God. She is embodiment of support to Christ. Her body literally carried him, and she supports him now. Her deep blue outfit, with hood pulled over head is very typical of Byzantine art.</p>

<p><strong>Saints Theodore</strong> on the left and<strong> George</strong>, on the right.  They are soldier/warrior saints and popular because they defended faith. Two angels gaze upward to the hand of God emerging from shaft of light.</p>
<p><strong>Christ </strong>appears as an old man in a baby’s body to indicate he contained infinite wisdom.</p>
<h5><strong>Background History</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between  Saints Theodore and George</strong>  was discovered at St. Catherine’s Monastery in Mount Sinai in Egypt, built during reign of Justinian in Byzantine Empire. This is the place where God appeared to Moses. This is the oldest continuously used Christian monastery.</p>
<p>This work is based on Late Egyptian funerary portraiture during the Roman period.  Byzantines occupied Roman Egypt, which was affected by Pompeiian wall paintings.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconoclastic Controversy</strong></h5>
<p>During the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> centuries Christians regard the devotion to icons as idolatry. This simply meant people were worshipping the objects, rather than worshipping to them or using them to guide their thoughts.</p>
<p>Icons became indispensable, personal mediums for spirituality and miracles were often ascribed to them. Many were fearful this was a relapse to pagan idolatry. As a direct result, icons were destroyed en masse. Today, very few survive. It is rare to find them.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Located in Vienna</p>
<p><strong><em>Vienna Genesis </em></strong>is a Byzantine, illuminated manuscript on <strong>purple vellum</strong>, <strong>painted with tempera, gold, and silver</strong>.  It measures <strong>12 inches by 9 inches. </strong>There is text, written in Greek on the top, with corresponding images below. Of the <strong>192 pages only 48 survive</strong>. It is the earliest well-preserved manuscript with biblical scenes.</p>
<p>Illuminated refers to both the vibrancy of the colour as well as the enlightenment the viewer experiences while reading the text.</p>
<p><strong>Vellum</strong> is calfskin. The reason calves were used was for the suppleness of the animal’s skin. Once slaughtered, the animal’s hide was soaked in lime water. Then the fur was removed and hung to dry.</p>
<p>The pages were originally purple, which was an expensive dye. The lettering was silver, but now is tarnished.</p>
<h5><strong>The Images </strong></h5>
<p>Images a use continuous narrative that bends upon itself. The figures are elongated . There is a skewed perspective. The use of space is not realistic.  All these factors are typical of the time.</p>
<h5><strong>First Book of the Old Testament</strong></h5>
<p>This manuscript is the first book of the Old Testament,  the Book of Genesis. It was made for prayer and to preserve Biblical stories.</p>
<p>Before the 15<sup>th</sup> century and the invention of printing, books were handmade and therefore expensive. This, along with the materials used the create <strong><em>Vienna Genesis</em></strong>, indicates a wealthy patron. The work would have been viewed as a symbol of status.</p>
<h5><strong>The Stories in the Book</strong></h5>
<p><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1:</strong> <strong>Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well </strong><strong>(Genesis 24: 15-61)</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_483" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-483" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-483" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Rebecca-and-Elizer-at-the-Well.jpg?resize=700%2C876&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Rebecca-and-Elizer-at-the-Well.jpg?w=263&amp;ssl=1 263w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Rebecca-and-Elizer-at-the-Well.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-483" class="wp-caption-text">Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well<br />© Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Gr. 31, fol. 7r</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rebecca leaves the city of Nahor to fetch water from a well, where she meets Eliezer collecting water for his camels. Eliezer is asked by Abraham to help his son Isaac find a wife.</p>
<p>Rebecca is matched with Isaac. The couple have children, Esau, and Jacob.</p>
<p>This is a story about God intervening to ensure a sound marriage for Abraham’s son.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2</strong>:<strong> Jacob Wrestling the Angel ( Genesis 32: 22-31)</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-484" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-484" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Jacon-Wrestling-the-Angel.jpg?resize=700%2C873&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="873" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Jacon-Wrestling-the-Angel.jpg?w=263&amp;ssl=1 263w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Jacon-Wrestling-the-Angel.jpg?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1 241w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-484" class="wp-caption-text">Jacob Wrestling the Angel<br />© Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Gr. 31, fol. 12r</figcaption></figure>
<p>Jacob, dressed in brown, leads his family across a bridge, over a river, on the back of a donkey.</p>
<p>Jacob becomes separated from his family. He and a man have a disagreement and they fight violently. Jacob’s hip is injured. The man is  really an angel in disguise, testing Jacob’s stamina and perseverance. An important transformation occurs as the angle blesses Jacob. The angle changes Jacob’s name to Israel and tells him he will be a patriarch.</p>
<p><strong>Classical Elements</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-573" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50-Vienna-Extract-Shot.jpg?resize=500%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="650" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The artist uses classical elements in the book with illustration.  In the story of <strong><em>Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well</em></strong>,  the river is personified by a female semi-nude figure, just like depictions of classical goddesses.</p>
<p>In <em><strong>Jacob Wrestling the Angel</strong></em><strong>,</strong> the bridge the family crosses has Roman columns and arches.</p>
<p>The drawings show drapery in the fabric with a sense of a figure underneath, like classical sculpturers.</p>
