<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1475" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=990%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.4 Theories and Interpretations of South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia developed many artistic and architectural traditions that are deeply rooted in Asian aesthetics and cultural practices. Asian arts and architecture reveal exchanges of knowledge in visual style, form, and technology with traditions farther west.</p>
<h5><strong>GrecoRoman Connections</strong></h5>
<p>Early connections with the <strong>GrecoRoman</strong> world are evident in the Hellenistic-influenced artistic style and subjects found in artwork associated with ancient Gandharan culture in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Early Buddha sculptures in north India, China, and Japan wear a two-shouldered robe based on the Roman toga.</p>
<h5><strong>Islamic Influence</strong></h5>
<p>South and Southeast Asia had early <strong>contact with Islam</strong> through trade. In western India, contact was achieved through military campaigns. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Islamic sultanates arose in these lands, creating another layer of cultural practices and interactions. This influenced Asian visual culture through the importation and creation of new art forms and styles.</p>
<p>Innovations based on Islamic influence in these areas include the use of paper for manuscripts and paintings. It also includes the adoption of Mughal styles in Hindu court architecture, painting, and fashion.</p>
<h5><strong>European Adaptations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>European influence</strong> is evident in the evolution of architectural styles, and in the adoption of naturalism and perspective in Asian painting traditions during the colonial era.</p>
<h5><strong>Sharing with West Asia and Europe</strong></h5>
<p>Asian art forms had great influence on the arts of West Asia and Europe. Art and ideas were exchanged through trade routes. The impact of Asian art is especially evident during times of free exchange. Import time frames include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Silk Route during the Han and Tang dynasties and Mongol Empire.</li>
<li>The colonial era.</li>
<li>The opening of Japan for trade in the 19th century.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>A Market for Collectors</strong></h5>
<p>In West Asia and Europe, collectors acquired Asian art works through gift or trade. Ceramics created in China, from Tang slipwares to highfire porcelains, have been coveted internationally for more than 1,000 years. The popularity of <strong>Chinese blue-and-white porcelain</strong> was so high that ceramic centers in Iran, Turkey, and across Europe developed local versions of blue-and-white ceramics to meet market demand.</p>
<p><strong>Textiles</strong> are also an important Asian art form. So coveted these fabrics dominated much of the international trade between Europe and Asia. <strong>Silk and silk weaving</strong> originated in <strong>China</strong>, where it flourished for thousands of years. <strong>Cotton</strong> was first spun and woven in the Indus Valley region of <strong>Pakistan</strong> and was, like silk, important for international trade.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Comparisons in Cultures</strong></h5>
<p>Cross-cultural comparisons may be made most readily among the arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia and the arts of the ancient Mediterranean, medieval Europe, and West Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Ryoan-ji (wet and dry gardens) </strong>is a<strong> rock garden in Kyoto, Japan </strong>that measures<strong> 100 feet by 33 feet. </strong></p>
<p>It has a rectangular plot of pebbles, surrounded by low earthen walls, with 15 rocks laid out in small groups on patches of moss. Rocks are encircled by white pebbles which are smooth river rock.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight on the Rocks</strong></p>
<p>The rocks are in five groups with 15 rocks in total.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 group of 5</li>
<li>2 groups of 3</li>
<li>2 groups of 2</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrangement of rocks leads the viewers’ eyes from left to right. Balance is achieved by small groups which create a rhythm and overall sense of harmony.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a <strong>Zen temple</strong>. It serves as a place of spiritual refreshment, contemplation, and rejuvenation. Since the elite practiced <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong>, this was a sign of status. It was used to incite meditation.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2069" style="width: 881px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2069" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=881%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="881" height="565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?w=330&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2069" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, dry garden © Vanni Archive/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The dry garden was viewed from a temple deck as an exercise in enlightenment and acceptance. No matter what vantage point you have, you can only ever see 14 out of the 15 rocks. It is said that you can only see the 15<sup>th</sup> rock through <strong>attaining enlightenment.</strong></p>
<p>The number <strong>15 denotes completeness in Buddhism.</strong></p>
<p>Buddhists maintain completeness is not possible.</p>
<p>If you TRULY accept that you can’t see the stone (that you cannot have completeness), then you become enlightened, and THEN you can see the 15<sup>th</sup> stone.</p>
<p>Visiting this dry garden is supposed to <strong>encourage meditation.  </strong>It is a place of contemplation and meditative practice for monks who rake the rocks daily into different patterns.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson</strong> is that you can work very hard at something – and you should – but that it will be gone the next day. This doesn’t mean that we should work less hard but rather <strong>appreciate things while we do them and accept that they will end or disappear</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>A Wet Garden</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2068" style="width: 883px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2068" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=883%2C588&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="883" height="588" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2068" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, wet garden<br />© John Lander Photography</figcaption></figure>
<p>A wet garden is an Immersive and natural experience. Meditation and contemplation encouraged through strolling around the garden. The sound of the water and birds is meant to be calming.</p>
<p>This reveals the deep respect the Japanese have for the natural world, and the belief that lessons and enlightenment can be learned/attained through the natural world.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>Zen Buddhist complex and gardens</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> means <strong>peaceful dragon.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>A Visual of the Wet Garden</strong></h5>
<p>The wet garden has two small islands in lake. There is a small shrine on one of the small islands in the lake. It can be accessed through a bridge. This is a shrine to the Shinto goddess of luck.</p>
<p>Cherry trees abound on the island. The pond that attracts water birds.</p>
<h5><strong>A Visual of the Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>dry garden </strong>is carefully raked each day by the Buddhist monks<strong>.</strong> These meticulous arrangements of rocks and pebbles are circled around each rock formation in particular patterns. It is unclear if these patterns have a particular meaning.</p>
<p>In 2002, a research team at Kyoto University claimed that the garden’s rocks, when viewed from the proper angle, subconsciously evoked the outline of a branching tree.</p>
<p><strong>Other theories:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A tigress escorting her cubs across the snow</li>
<li>The Chinese character for “heart” or “mind”</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>The Influence of Zen Buddhist Principles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Restraint, simplicity, and honesty are held in esteem</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Immersion in nature (gardens)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Ryoan-ji was originally a Fujiwara aristocrat’s villa during the Heian Period. Later, a powerful warlord captured the villa and converted it to a Zen Buddhist temple in 1450 CE.</p>
<p>This was constructed for the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism that came from China in 1191 CE</p>
<p>Zen gardens are a principal concept of <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong>, which was a type of Buddhism that the elite practiced because it required ample time in the day for meditation, gardening, tea-drinking</p>

<h3><strong>300 BCE-1980 CE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1475" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=990%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>Trade greatly affected the development of Asian cultures and Asian art. Two major methods for international trade connected Asia. One was <strong>the Silk Route</strong> that linked Europe and Asia, connecting the Indian subcontinent to overland trade routes through Central Asia, terminating in X’ian, China. The second was the vast <strong>maritime networks</strong> that utilized seasonal monsoon winds to move trade among North Africa, West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and south China. These routes were the vital mechanism for the transmission of cultural ideas and practices, such as Buddhism, and of artistic forms, media, and styles across mainland and maritime Asia.</p>
<h5><strong>Religion and Culture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Buddhism</strong> was actively imported to Japan from Korea and China in the 7th and 8th centuries. It succeeded first in China, and then other countries, because of courtly patronage and similarities with local traditions.</p>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia were also home to <strong>foreign cultures and religions</strong>, including <strong>GrecoRoman</strong> cultures, <strong>Christianity</strong>, and most notably <strong>Islamic </strong>cultures from West and Central Asia. Islamic influence is particularly strong in India, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which were under at least partial control of Islamic sultanates during the second millennia CE. These regions have also been influenced by cultures and beliefs from West Asia and Europe. Today South and Southeast Asia are home to the world’s largest <strong>Muslim </strong>populations.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Chinese Buddhist sculpture</p>
<p><strong>Themes: </strong></p>
<p>Politics<br />
Propaganda<br />
Religion<br />
Place of worship<br />
Rulers</p>
<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>is located at<strong> Longmen Caves, in Luoyang, China.</strong> Made from hard, gray <strong>limestone </strong>the largest Buddha<strong> measures 57 feet. </strong>These were carved<strong> in situ</strong> into <strong>living rock</strong> as <strong>high relief. </strong>Here there are 2,300 caves and niches that extends for over a mile.</p>
<p>The Buddha and bodhisattvas display a new, softer, and rounder modeling, as well as facial expressions. Vajrapani and lokapala display a more engaging and animated musculature, with forceful poses. These would have been painted in brilliant blues, reds, browns, and golds.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p>This is a place of <strong>Buddhist worship.</strong></p>
<p>The patrons were emperors (and one empress) and this was the display of power and piety of these people. Rulers wielded Buddhism to affirm their piety, superiority, and tolerance.  Specifically, this revealed the strength and spirituality of Tang Dynasty. It was a metaphor for political power.</p>
<p>This arrangement with <strong>Buddha in the center</strong> emphasized a correct religious order.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2054" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2054" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.B.jpg?resize=757%2C504&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="757" height="504" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.B.jpg?w=317&amp;ssl=1 317w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.B.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2054" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />© Christian Kober/Robert Harding World Imagery/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, the Tang Dynasty was struggling to balance bureaucrats and aristocrats, who consistently posed a threat to the emperors. For emperors to sponsor productions of artworks such as these was to show that there was a likeness between the emperors and Buddha. Thus, aristocrats and bureaucrats should be subservient to the emperor, just as bodhisattvas and disciples were to Buddha.</p>
<p>This sculptural arrangement intentionally <strong>mirrored the political situation</strong> – one person is supreme.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2055" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2055" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?resize=733%2C548&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="733" height="548" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?w=442&amp;ssl=1 442w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2055" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />Used by Permission</figcaption></figure>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>contains in total almost 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, more than 60 stupas, and 2800 inscriptions.</p>
<p><strong>A Look at Fengxian Cave</strong></p>
<p>The specific cave we are examining is called Fengxian Cave.  Here 9 figures pose as a group.</p>
<p><strong>From Left to right: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Bodhisattva</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Vairocana Buddha</strong> (Buddha who represents all the infinite wisdom in the universe),</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Bodhisattva</strong></li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A bodhisattva</strong> are Buddhists who do not pass on to nirvana, but who stays to help.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrapani</strong> are Chinese guardians of Buddha, who wields thunderbolts. The violence is justified only if there is a threat made to Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>Lokapala</strong> are heavenly kings who watch over one of each of the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>There are many <strong>smaller figures of deities, monks, and donors</strong> surrounding the nine main figures.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Most of the carvings date between the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century and the middle of the 8<sup>th</sup> century (Northern Wei through early Tang). Wei had moved capital to Luoyang in 494 CE.</p>
<p><strong>Tang Dynasty</strong> was considered the age of Buddhism in China</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddhism and Confucianism each vied for power over emperors.</li>
<li>Many Chinese, Indian, Central Asian, and Southeast Asian monks traveled through Asia, spreading Buddhism’s messages.</li>
<li>Alternating periods of Chinese Buddhism’s popularity or lack thereof prevented constant flow of work.</li>
<li>Largest period of construction (and the construction of Fengxian Caves) was sponsored by Emperor Gaozong, and his wife and <strong>the one and only empress of China, Empress Wu.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Sailendra Dynasty. c. 750–842 centuries</p>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong>, in <strong>Central Java, Indonesia</strong>, is made from <strong>volcanic-stone masonry</strong>. It is <strong>the largest Buddhist temple in the world</strong> and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is 300 years older than Angkor Wat and 400 years older than the European Cathedrals. The Indonesian temple was buried under volcanic ash and overgrown with vegetation until discovered by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Raffles in 1814. A team of Dutch archaeologists restored the site in 1907–11. A second restoration was completed by 1983.</p>

<p>Visiting the temple requires circumambulating through the corridors. It is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the Four Noble Truths (also known as the dharma and the law). This helps to understand samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>Climbing up successive terraces allows for understanding the transition from the lowest manifestations of reality, through a series of spiritual regions, toward the enlightenment at the summit which allows unrestricted views of the mountains, offering a liberating feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p>One <strong>enters on the east gate</strong>, and <strong>reads from left to right</strong>, moving in a <strong>clockwise direction</strong> around the monument. Almost 5 km of <strong>carved bas reliefs</strong> educate the illiterate according to Mahayana Buddhism texts. These texts deal with the self-discovery and education of the bodhisattva, conceived as being with compassionate, and fully devoted to the salvation of all creatures.</p>
<p>The stories from Buddha’s life, Jataka and Avadana illustrate lessons on morality, karma and merit that distinguished the enlightened creature.</p>
<p>Buddhist religion, philosophy and cosmology is woven into the architecture of the Borobudur. The temple is the symbol of Mount Meru, which is considered the center of the universe in Indian cosmology.</p>
<p>Based on the teachings of Buddha the temple represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Four Noble Truths</li>
<li>the Noble Eightfold Path</li>
<li>the three realms of existence: Kāmadhātu, Rūpadhātu and Arūpadhātu</li>
</ul>
<p>These help to guide the visitors  to follow the spiritual teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Kāmadhātu</strong> <strong>(Desire Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>160 reliefs based on the text of Mahakarmavibhangga, which is about the law of cause and effect (karma).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rūpadhātu (Form Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scenes depicting mankind’s consciousness about the meaning of life through reliefs on a four sides gallery, both inside and out.</li>
<li>To view in the correct order, one must walk around clockwise four times and observe both upper and lower reliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arūpadhātu (Formless Realm) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reliefs depicted at the top illustrating Enlightenment (Nirvāṇa) which requires an almost five kilometer walk clockwise, ten times, to view correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Other Forms of Decoration</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>birds</li>
<li>flowers</li>
<li>mythical beings like Kāla above the temple entrance</li>
<li>Makara mythical being with an elephant trunk and an open mouth from which the head of a lion emerges are at the base of the gate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is shaped as a stepped grey andesite pyramid with 3 levels—a square base, a middle level of five square terraces, and an upper level of three circular terraces—totaling 9 lesser sections. The number 9 which represents the end of a cycle in the decimal system, which originated from the Indian subcontinent as early as 3000 BC is mystic in Buddhism and Hinduism. Important Buddhist rituals usually involve 9 monks.</p>

<p><strong>The historical Buddha had 9 virtues</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accomplished</li>
<li>Perfectly Enlightened</li>
<li>Endowed with knowledge and Conduct</li>
<li>Well-spoken</li>
<li>the Knower of worlds</li>
<li>the Guide Unsurpassed of men to be tamed</li>
<li>the Teacher of gods and men</li>
<li>Enlightened</li>
<li>Blessed</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>3 circular terraces carry small stupas</strong>, crowned at the centre of the summit by a large, circular, bell-shaped stupa, 115 feet (35 metres) above the base. The bottom plinth encasement that obscures an entire series of reliefs consists of a massive heap of stone pressed up against the original structure. It was probably added to hold together the bottom story, which began to spread under the pressure of the immense weight of earth and stone accumulated above.</p>
<p>The lowest level, which is partially hidden, contains reliefs of earthly desires, illustrating “the realm of feelings/desires”, <strong>the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe</strong>. It portrays the law of cause and effect. For example, if you like gossiping, you might be reborn with an ugly appearance.</p>
<p>The next level is a 13-foot-wide corridor open to the sky and adorned with bas-reliefs that depict “the realm of forms” through events in the life of the historical Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas. There are 2 registers: the balustrade depicting fables about altruism.</p>
<p>Opposite the balustrade is the main wall where the Jatakas stories are located.</p>
<p><strong>Lalitavistara,</strong> a set of 120 reliefs on the first platform, depict Prince Siddharta’s life from birth to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Queen Maya riding  in a horse carriage is retreating to Lumbini garden to give birth to Prince Siddhartha. In the nativity scene, Queen Maya&#8217;s depiction recalls the tree spirits or yakshinis. These spirits are are often shown as beautiful and voluptuous, with a flywhisk in right hand, fleshy cheeks, wide hips, narrow waists, broad shoulders, knotted hair and exaggerated, spherical breasts. According to legend, the infant stood and took seven steps. With each step, a lotus flower appeared, to prevent his tiny feet from touching the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Here is the Story</strong></p>
<p>“Prince Siddharta was born to King Sudhodana and Queen Maya of the Sakya clan who reigned in Kosala, India, around the fifth century BC. One day Queen Maya had a dream of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was interpreted by priests as a sign that the couple would bear a son, who would become either a world ruler or a Buddha. The king preferred him to be the world ruler, so he confined the prince in the palace and indulged him in sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>As fate had it, one day the prince went out of his palace and he saw a sick person, an old person, a corpse, and a monk. Siddharta realized that he, too, would become old, sick, and die. Later, he renounced his mundane life and embarked on his search for true happiness. After learning from several spiritual teachers, and practicing severe ascetism for six years, he finally meditated under a bodhi tree. Here he attained enlightenment. Because of his compassion for fellow humans, he revealed the path to achieve unconditional happiness.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Jataka tales</strong> are about the 500 Bodhisattvas, the alternating human and animal forms in which Buddha was reincarnated before he was born as Prince Siddhartha and attained enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>Animals perform self-sacrifices for other beings</strong>. “A sad monkey hugging a buffalo’s neck is the story of real friendship. One day a monkey had a problem. An ogre wanted to eat him. Devastated, the monkey told his buffalo friend about his fate. The buffalo comforted the monkey, saying that he would offer himself instead. What’s more, the buffalo’s body was bigger. The buffalo just asked themonkey to send his best wishes to his relatives. Then they both met the ogre. Touched by thekindness of the buffalo, the ogre dismissed his plan to eat either of them.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avadana (Noble Deeds)</strong> are similar to Jataka, but the main figures are legendary people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sudhana’s quest for enlightenment</strong></p>
<p>He was an Indian youth, maybe a merchant’s son seeking bodhi (enlightenment). He takes a pilgrimage on his quest for enlightenment and studies under 52 “teachers”: a doctor teaches him compassion for the ill, children playing teach him about simple happiness,…</p>
<h5><strong>Detachment from the Physical World</strong></h5>
<p>The upper level illustrates “the realm of formlessness,” or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration, but lining the terraces are <strong>72 bell-shaped stupas, many containing a statue of the Buddha, partly visible through the lattice stonework</strong>. The <strong>504 Buddha statues are shaped to express 6 different mudras</strong> (hand positions).</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Buddha Hand Gestures and Significance</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right hand across right knee symbolizing the summons of the Earth Goddess.</li>
<li>Right hand open with the face of the hand facing upwards – a symbolic gesture of loving kindness by the act of giving.</li>
<li>Both hands folded on his lap symbolic for meditation.</li>
<li>Right hand raised upwards with the face of the hand facing the audience – a symbolic gesture of dispelling of fear.</li>
<li>Right hand slightly lifted upwards with the tips of his thumb and index finger touching each other – a symbolic gesture of preaching the Dharma.</li>
<li>Both hands raised in front of the center of the upper body, touching with his right ring finger his left index finger – by far the most important symbolic gesture, for it represents the turning of the wheel of the Dharma.</li>
<li>The archways allow people to access the higher levels are decorated with pre-Buddhist elements,  such as the fearsome face and open mouth of Kala. This is a Hindu deity from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, In Javanese mythology, Batara. Kala is the god of destruction.</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Symbolism of the Mandala</strong></h5>
<p>The temple’s plan suggests a <strong>mandala</strong>, one of the richest visual objects in Buddhism. A mandala is a symbolic picture of the universe painted on a wall or scroll, or simply created with colored sands on a table. It represents an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation. Each object in the palace has significance, representing an aspect of wisdom or reminding the meditator of a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The <strong>mandala&#8217;s purpose is to help transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones</strong> and to <strong>assist with healing. </strong> The entire sacred manmade mountain of chiseled gray andesite is a giant stupa. On the topmost terrace, the main stupa contained an unfinished image of Buddha with the hands not fully carved that was hidden from the spectator’s view, symbolized the indefinable ultimate spiritual state.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>Progressively the reliefs on the terraces become more static. The sensuous roundness of the forms of the figures is not abated but, in the design, great emphasis is laid upon horizontals and verticals and upon static, formal enclosures of repeated figures and gestures. At the summit all movement disappears.</p>
<p>The circular design enclosing the stupa, between the reliefs are decorative scroll panels, and a hundred monster-head waterspouts carrying off the tropical rainwater.</p>
<p>The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar.</p>
<h5><strong>The Javanese Variation</strong></h5>
<p>Although the origin of the temple is based on Indian mythology and Buddhist iconography, one can see the Javanese influence. The statues are less refined and have been recreated in the local perception of beauty. This is the way Buddhism was manifested in Java during the Sailendra dynasty.</p>
<p>Based on Indian influences and Mahāyāna Buddhism, arriving via China during Tang dynasty (618-906), this became the Buddhism of Java.</p>
<p>Sailendra dynasty shared their power with the Hindu dynasty Sanjaya. For example, the construction of the Kalasan temple – illustrates, that, apart from its religious function, the Borobudur also formed an important expression of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>The congregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage paying reverence to the stupa. This is achieved by circumambulating and keeping it on the right. The visitor is transformed and educated, while climbing through the levels of Borobudur. The encountering of illustrations of progressively more profound tales from Jataka and Avadana is achieved in a  similar way to the very early frescoes of the Ajanta Caves in India.</p>
<p>Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.</p>
<p>Vesak, the “Buddha Day” ceremony, occurs once a year during a full moon. thousands of Buddhist monks walk in solemn procession to Borobudur to commemorate the Buddha’s birth, death, and enlightenment. Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Angkor Wat, in Siem Reap, Cambodia</strong> is the largest religious monument in the world. It was <strong>built for the patron King Suryavarman</strong> II (1113–1145/50 C.E.) and dedicated to the Hindu god <strong>Vishnu</strong>, one of the three principal gods in the Hindu pantheon, along with <strong>Shiva and Brahma</strong>. Vishnu is known as the protector.</p>
<p>It is believed that <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> was also to house the king after death and used as a mausoleum.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> comes from the Khmer language, the official language of Cambodia. It means City Temple.</p>
<p><strong>Siem Reap</strong> was once the capital of the Khmer empire, <strong>then known as Angko</strong>r. From the 800s to the 1300s it was a prosperous hydraulic facility that collected monsoon waters from the rainy season, in huge basins. This elevated flooding, and protected plantations during drought.</p>
<p>Merchants and traders of gold and spices brought Hinduism and later Buddhism. Business opportunities caused people to stay in the region</p>
<p>Since Angkor itself was the technical source of the life-giving agricultural water controlled by the king, it was regarded by the Khmer with religious reverence. Its temples and palaces were an expression of that and at the same time an essential part of its supernatural mechanism.</p>
<p>Royal intercession by numerous ceremonies, some of which re-enacted the primal marriage of Hindu divinity and native earth spirit on the pattern of ancient folk cult, ensured the continuing gift of the waters of heaven.</p>
<p>The king, an earthly image of his god, was the intermediary who ensured that his kingdom would continue to receive divine benevolence in the form of water in controlled quantities.</p>
<p>Courtiers played roles both religious and administrative for the king, who believed that after his death he would be united with his patron deity. Dedicatory statues were often set up in his chief temple to commemorate his divinization.</p>
<p>The Khmer kings were tied to the city, even as they changed religions. The city was transformed using both Hindi and Mahayana Buddhist architecture and artistic style layers beneath the surface of the temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large moat and a high wall surround Angkor Wat on all sides, which are longer than one kilometer.</p>
<p>Inside the temple develops on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new enclosure, formed of galleries, pierced with monumental porches on all four sides and provided with corner towers</li>
<li>a <strong>second floor</strong> repeating the same arrangement</li>
<li>a <strong>central tower</strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries staggered and interconnected by cruciform galleries</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>temple mountain</strong> was a Southeast Asian invention in architecture. It represented a union between the gods and the reigning king. The capital, a square measuring 4 kilometers on each side was lined with a double rise of land. Here two axial avenues crossed ending in a natural hill in the center.</p>
<p>The five stone towers symbolized the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru, the mythical home of Hindu and Buddhist gods. It was also considered an <strong>axis-mundi</strong> or a world axis that connects heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In his city, the king could intercede and re-enact the marriage of the Hindu divinity and the earth spirit to ensure the continuing gift of waters from the heaven</p>
<h5><strong>Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The temples continued to multiple, with each sovereign trying to outdo the next.  The small temple of <strong>Banteay Srei</strong>, built in 967, is located 20 kilometers north-east of Angkor. It is surrounded by a low-rise enclosure that is pierced by entrance pavilions and bordered by a moat. With three towers consisting of pink sandstone, this is the first temple to use relief sculptures to illustrate Indian legends. This is a prelude to classical Khumer style. Note the reliefs of <strong>devatas </strong>(gods of Hindu epics such as Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and the <strong>tympanums</strong> depicting Hindu myths, such as the rain of Indra.</p>
<h5><strong>Rich in Decoration</strong></h5>
<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> over a thousand dancing <strong>apsaras</strong> (female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) unfold on the walls of the different courts and on the pilasters. Dressed in a bell skirt from which are two large pieces of cloth at the waist, they are lavishly adorned with bracelets, armbands, necklaces and earrings, and extravagant hairstyles.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Bas-Relief Sculptures</strong></h5>
<p>The greatest achievement of the <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> sculptors has been reached in the tens of meters long bas-reliefs of the galleries of the second such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk</em></strong> or <strong><em>Heavens and Hells</em></strong>.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Myth </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Churning of the Milk</em></strong> is a Hindu myth about the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil, as well as light and darkness. Due to this struggle twelve precious things are lost in the ocean.</p>
<p>The god Vishnu thought to use the holy mountain Mt. Mandara as a churning stick, surrounded by the serpent king (naga). This was tugged between the demons and the gods. They pulled with all their might! The churning stick stirred the waters of the milky sea for 1000 years&#8212; before recovering the <strong>amrita</strong>, the elixir of eternal life. The foam from the churning produces apsaras<em>,</em> who appear on both sides of Vishnu. Once the elixir was released, the supreme god of the Vedes, Indra descended to catch it and to save the world from the demons.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rise of Jayavarman VII</strong></h5>

<p>After the death of Suryavarman II, the Champa (the people of nowadays Vietnam) occupied the Khmer kingdom for four years (1145 to 1149).</p>
<p>Jayavarman VII achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>liberated his country and restored order.</li>
<li>conquered Champa (Vietnam), Laos, Thailand and Burma achieving the maximum extent of the Khmer kingdom</li>
<li>enthroned in 1181</li>
<li>reorganized the Khmer country</li>
<li>built a road network linking the provinces to the capital and lined them with lodgings for travelers</li>
<li>built hospitals</li>
<li>changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahāyāna).</li>
<li>raised temples dedicated to the worship of his parents</li>
<li>1186, that of Ta Prohm, in Angkor itself, dedicated to his mother deified under the aspect of a female counterpart bodhisattva.</li>
<li>1191, the temple of Preah Khan of Angkor, in memory of his father in the aspect of Bodhisattva &#8220;Lord of the World&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Work in Progress</strong></h5>
<p>Simultaneously, he had to restore <strong>Angkor Thom</strong> the capital itself, destroyed and pillaged by the Chams. It used to be centered on the Baphuon, which was more than a hundred years old.  Jayavarman VII recentered it on a new temple-mountain, the Bayon and surrounded it by a moat and a high wall of stone. The new city, Angkor Thom, was &#8211; like the previous ones &#8211; enclosed in a vast quadrilateral, each side of which was oriented in relation to a cardinal point. Four triumphal ways (north-south and east-west) cut it into quarters.</p>
<p>The Buddhist cosmology inspired the symbolism and dispositions of the great foundations (Angkor Thom, Preah Khan, etc.). The architecture (plans and elevations of the temples, construction processes) and sculpture (iconography, aesthetics, adjustments) of the style of the center of its new capital, Bàyon break with four centuries of stylistic evolution and mark its end.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p>Construction was not random. By combining Brahmanic notions and Buddhist ideas the architectural purpose was the glorification of the king, his deification, and his identification with the empire. Jayavarman VII, converted to Buddhism, found satisfactory solutions present the capital as the center of the world of the gods, where the king lived as equal of the gods and the protector of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>moats were oceans that encircled the world, enclosing the mountain ranges that border it</li>
<li>doors, surmounted by towers adorned with the deified face repeated four times, facing each cardinal point</li>
<li>gave access to roads lined on both sides of a hundred and eight giants of stone holding a colossal naga</li>
<li>theme of churning of the ocean, myth of creation, and that of the rainbow unites heaven and earth.</li>
<li>In the center, the Bayon, symbolic temple-mountain with a circular interior and radiant reminiscent of the Buddhist stupas, provided 50 faces, with the &#8220;smile of Angkor&#8221;, which one finds the echo in the countless statuary of this time.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Angkor Wat as a Mandala</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>mandala </strong>or circle in Sanskirt, is a spiritual geometric configuration of temples in Buddhism. This allows for harmony with the universe by aligning with the planets, sunrise, and sunset. <strong>Angkor’s</strong> central axis through the temple’s main tower, aligns with the morning sun of the Spring Equinox.</p>
<h5><strong>Destruction, Change and Abandonment</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>In 1234, Jayavaram VIII, who succeeded two Buddhist Kings, destroyed Angkor and all effigies of Buddha. He was an iconoclast operating at a very large scale. In total tens of thousands of Buddha images were defaced.</p>
<p>At the end of the 13th century, the definitive adoption of Theravāda Buddhism led to a radical change in architectural traditions and ended all major construction programs. Advocating a simpler way of life, the Theravada Buddhism made <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> the Buddhist center of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Around 1431 a new Thai attack destroyed the hydraulic system on which the economy of the kingdom was based. Shortly after, the royal court abandoned <strong>Angkor.</strong>               <u></u></p>

<p><em><strong>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</strong></em><strong> </strong>is also known as <em><strong>Jahangir Enthroned on an Hourglass</strong></em>. This work<strong> on paper, by artist Bichitra</strong> is comprised of <strong>watercolor, gold and ink</strong> and measures <strong>10 inches tall.</strong></p>
<p>It is one of the <strong>symbolic paintings</strong> of Jahangir&#8217;s reign, eulogizing the power status of the contemporary dynasty. One of the many novel expression methods, the symbolism is distinctly handled.</p>
<p>To view you must concentrate on the <strong>aesthetics of composition</strong>, <strong>color palette</strong>, and a manipulative variation of <strong>figural sizes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong>, the painter, depicted various <strong>vegetal forms</strong> along with the <strong>calligraphic</strong> verses on the border. This trademark work combining many regional influences, illustrates Bichitra’s use of <strong>cross-cultural motifs</strong> to convey Mughal principles. Jahangir accepted European entry into the Indian subcontinent, which brought in <strong>western motifs in Indian art</strong>. This included Mughal miniatures are a part of larger books.</p>
<p>The thick and colorful <strong>floral border</strong> on the painting defines the Jahangir-era of Mughal art. The folio, as part of Muraqqa, establishes the spiritual trait of Jahangir’s personality by portraying the Sufi Sheikh as a prior figure after himself.</p>
<h5><strong>The Main Characters</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-846" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=673%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="673" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=673%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 673w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=197%2C300&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?resize=768%2C1169&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-A.jpg?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The painting comprises five human figures of a reputed status, in decreasing order of visual size. The largest figure is that of <strong>King Jahangir</strong>, while the man in front of him is <strong>Sufi Sheikh Hussain</strong>, in a dimension little shorter than him. The king is adorned with jewelry as opposed to pale garb of the sheikh.</p>
<p>King Jahangir is handing over a book to the Sufi Sheikh Hussain, which he accepts in a shawl, avoiding the physical contact, as an imperial protocol.</p>
<p>The figure below the spiritual leader is an <strong>Ottoman sultan</strong>, followed by <strong>English King James I</strong>. Ottoman sultan&#8217;s turban-tied headdress distinguishes him as a foreigner to the Mughal court, while he awaits his chance to greet Jahangir. King James I, in his royal attire, gazes out of the painting, which is a typical style of European art.</p>
<p>The last figure is that of <strong>the artist</strong> himself, <strong>Bichitra</strong>. Despite the significance over the form of the King’s figure, the ochre-chrome yellow garb of Bichitra grabs the attention compulsively. However, the attire&#8217;s fashion indicates that he was a Hindu artist in the Mughal court. He is holding a miniature painting, which suggests his profession.</p>
<h5><strong>Adaptations of European Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from these, the other flying semi-human forms are <strong>putti figures</strong>, which are European-influenced characters.</p>
<p><strong>The halo</strong> behind the Jahangir’s head, and <strong>hourglass</strong>, are further adaptations of European forms. Concentric in kind, glaring flames around the head seemingly recognize his sun-like illuminated and authoritative demeanor.</p>
<p>At the same time, the crescent moon at the lower arc of the halo is a prevalent representation of spiritual enlightenment in Jain paintings. Symbolically, the crescent moon also narrates the endless cycle of day and night.</p>
<p><strong>King Jahangir</strong> is seated on a large and ornate hourglass. On the putti on the hourglass are engraving with an inscription that reads, “Allah is great. O Shah may the span of your reign be a thousand years”.</p>
<p>The hourglass is an emblematic attribute of the beginning of the new Islamic millennium, it begins with the rule of a knowledgeable Mughal ruler.</p>
<p>From these forms we can infer that Bichitra had been studying European artworks that were accepted by the king as gifts.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism</strong></h5>
<p>While figures are naturalistic and convincingly real, space itself is tipped <strong>upwards and flattened</strong>. A few areas are painted in gradual tonal values, while the rest is in flat application of colors. Artist has utilized a <strong>colorful palette</strong> with incredibly precise and intricate detailing. Notably, the division of backdrop helps in acquiring a rhythmic gaze over the work.</p>
<p>An ornate lower half, which apparently is a Persianate carpet, is replete with <strong>abstract, repetitive, and naturalistic design.</strong> In addition, the artist has neglected linear perspective to feature the content significantly.</p>
<h5><strong>Frames Within Frames</strong></h5>
<p>The painting is enclosed in a <strong>group of rectangular frames</strong> that show a varying <strong>floral and calligraphic designs</strong>. Bordering with repetitive and small decorative cartouches, the background of the folio has floral arabesque. These <strong>floral motifs</strong> are inspired by the local flowers of the region.</p>
<p>At the cusp of the painting, on the vertical edges, the band depicts a calligraphic verse praising the king. The lower band expresses, “Though outwardly Shahs stand before him, he fixes his gaze on dervishes.”</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mughal miniatures</strong> were often a part of a more comprehensive book project called <strong>Muraqqa</strong>. Murraqas describes lives of Mughal kings or elites. They were accessible to the selected and not common men.</p>
<p>After the volume was written, it would be given to an artist with secluded pages to illustrate the relevant narratives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this folio was to render a spiritual and wise image of noble Mughal King Jahangir. As he preferred a spiritual Sufi Sheikh over the kings of the world, he is indicated to be a grand sovereign of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Mughal paintings are said to have used <strong>gold, silver, and lapiz lazuli</strong>, among other hues, for rendition. The usage of material depended on the project and the role it played over the larger mass. The <strong>colors</strong> were generally obtained from <strong>local natural resources</strong>. For example, white was made by grinding the conch, while black from the lamp residue.</p>
<p>In addition, Mughal kings followed greater political propaganda to disperse the might of the Mughal ruler. It also displayed Jahangir’s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety’s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.</p>
<h5><strong>Traditions</strong></h5>
<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance</strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.</p>
<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him</strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp’s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous <em>Hamzanama</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hamzanama </em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers</strong>.</p>
<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir’s court painters</p>
<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong> (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to <em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em> under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases. <em>Baburnama</em>, <em>Akbarnama</em>, <em>Tujuk-I- Jahangir</em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing ateliers</strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.</p>
<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.</strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved</strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette</strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts</strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.</p>
<p>During Akbar’s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Bichitra was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir’s reign.</p>

<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in <strong>Agra, Uttar Pradesh, in Northern India</strong>, is an ancient <strong>Indian mausoleum</strong> representing exquisite <strong>Indo-Islamic architecture</strong> that measures <strong>240 feet</strong> across and sits on <strong>42 acres</strong>. The building is made with <strong>stone masonry</strong> and <strong>marble</strong>, along with <strong>an inlay of precious and semiprecious stones</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is an ancient Indian mausoleum representing exquisite Indo-Islamic architecture. Considered as one of the seven man-made wonders of the world, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is known as the <strong>Crown of the Palace</strong>. Originally, it was known as Rauza-i-munawwara, which means illuminated tomb.</p>
<p>Projecting unique beauty, the mausoleum is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb. Comprising calligraphic decoration in precious gemstones, it is an exceptional Mughal structure in white marble. Many kinds of research on the yellowing of the marble have been conducted in light of global warming, resulting in strict restrictions over the surrounding vicinity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is not a singular marvel, rather it is a large complex of twin mosques, exemplary gardens, and marvelous gates. In 1983, UNESCO designated the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> and the complex as World Heritage site. A thoughtful blend of Persian, Turkic, and Indian styles, it is one of the finest instances of Mughal art and architecture.</p>

<p>The Mughal kingdom had expanded its rule over vast areas of northern and central India. Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces. <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is situated in the center of a large complex on 42 acres.  The complex consists of the main tomb flanked by twin mosques—they are identical in size and rendition—that face the tomb. It also consists of a guest house and beautiful gardens called Chahar bagh, which used the Persian style.</p>
<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone</strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna River, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.</p>
<p>The <strong>Taj Mahal is built on a square and raised platform</strong> or a plinth. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of eight paradises, rendering the plan octagonally. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber. The onion-shaped dome is flanked by four minarets at the four corners of the plinth. Mounted with a finial and a crescent moon, the dome is a golden spot of wonder. At the lower lever, four smaller-sized domes surrounding the central dome. Each smaller dome is comprised of a <em>chhatri </em>(kiosk), enclosing a balcony.</p>
<p>The <strong>arched gate to enter the tomb</strong> is called <em><strong>iwan</strong></em>. It is framed by a rectangular and decorated surface called <em>pishtaq</em>. The gates and other walls project <strong>chamfered corners</strong>, a peculiar style of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the four minarets are tilted away from the central dome, as a precautionary act to avoid damage to the main structure, especially during an occurrence of a natural calamity. Minarets also have a <em><strong>chhatri</strong></em><em> </em>and a staircase to reach the top. They are associated with the religious duty of calling for daily prayers. The <em><strong>muezzin</strong></em>, the official assigned the announcing duty, calls the public for the <em><strong>namaz</strong></em><em> </em>or prayer from these minarets.</p>
<p>The central chamber places the two cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz. Shah Jahan died thirty years after his wife. Mumtaj died after giving birth to their 14th offspring in 1631. The real sarcophagi are safely stored at the lower level. The sarcophagi are ornate with calligraphy. The surface calligraphic verses from the Quran are inlaid in precious stones. The technique is known as Pietra dura, which uses cut and polished colored stones. The verses refer to the paradise and day of judgment, wherein God royally and dutifully rewards the faithful.</p>
<p>The tomb shows many floral patterns, as animal or human figures are prohibited, due to Islam protocols. In addition, the <em><strong>jali</strong></em><em> </em>or a mesh decorative and lapidary is frequently observed.</p>
<p>Composed unconventionally, as opposed to other Mughal or Islamic tombs, the surface of the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is wondrously composed to derive an impeccable play of light and shadow.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is a mausoleum and it serves a funerary function. Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.</p>
<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan. Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of compassion and royalty.</p>
<p>As it is built on the raised platform, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural metaphor for Paradise. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is the symbol of unconditioned love. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the<strong> Taj Mahal</strong> has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaz by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.</p>
<p>Significantly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> emphasizes the power vested in royal Mughal patrons. Shah Jahan decided to build it in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, bringing many Persian artists to India. The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of miniature paintings. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing and being influenced by indigenous Indian art. Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.</p>
<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s</strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of <strong>Islamic and Indian architecture</strong>.  Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule. Many motifs from Hindu culture had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style</strong>, some <strong>plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Mughals were Islamic rulers in India – known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. It is mentioned that Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, which allowed for easy access to water, Agra was known as a “riverfront” city.</p>
<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent.</p>
<p>The five principal elements of the complex, which includes the main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”, a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.</p>
<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> welcomes millions of worldwide tourists every year. After the Taj Mahal was listed a one of the seven man-made wonders of the world, its popularity has grown by leaps and bounds. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns. This has resulted in many new rules and regulations for visitors. Shah Jahan erected this wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection. This was a ground-breaking achievement.  It has continued to draw crowds to Agra to receive a glimpse of architectural beauty. Even after four hundred years Taj Mahal continues to inspire great awe.</p>
<p>During this time in history, the Indian continent observed an influx of Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, conducting business with Indian counterparts. The presence of Europeans also appears in many Mughal paintings, proving their acceptance in Mughal courts. Shah Jahan was a promoter of arts and culture. This did not pass onto the next Mughal ruler and his son Aurangzeb. This led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving ground for the British to take charge by the 18th century.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 10.4 Theories and Interpretations of Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>The study of art history is shaped by different theories and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated, and adapted to make an art historical argument about a work or a group of works of art. Intended meanings are often open-ended and subject to multiple interpretations.</p>

Each <strong>16-foot-tall gate</strong> had a piece of <strong>saffron colored fabric</strong> hanging to 7 feet above ground level. The widths of the gates matched the widths of the walkways. Gates were set down to avoid drilling.  The structures formed an oval path that intersected. There was no start or ending points.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> introduced eye-catching color into the landscape and infused light into a winter scene. Orange contrasted with brown and gave off the “spring is coming” vibe.</p>
<p>The work was temporary with all materials intended for recycling or sale.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The installation was free to the public. The artists wanted to alter the experience of walking in the park to be an original, temporary experience. A golden ceiling creating warm shadows for visitors, as well as a refuge from city life. It encouraged people to go outdoors. It made people look and drew attention to the landscape.</p>
<p>In aerial view. <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> looked like a golden river that appeared and disappeared among the trees in the park.</p>
<p>How does art respond to and impact our relationship with the built environment? What is natural? What is “constructed”?</p>
<p>This work helped to move visitors from being unaware of their surroundings to aware and engaged.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Gates</strong> was only exhibited from February 12<sup>th</sup> – February 27<sup>th</sup>, 2005, in Central Park.</p>
<p>The fabric moved organically with the wind. Light moved through it mirroring the visitors’ movement underneath it.</p>
<p>The installation was inspired by Japanese Shinto tradition of torii (gates) that mark the transition at shrines from the secular to the sacred.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The husband-and-wife artist team of  <strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>developed the concept for the art installation in 1979. It was not produced until 2005. For this reason, we can consider it as linked to environmental/site-specific art of the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> cost $21 million. The artist financed the project themselves. There were no sponsors, instead they self-fund every project and sold merchandise related to the exhibition. Part of the costs of the work were wages for 600 workers to install it. The team also paid for security guards at night.</p>
<p>The artists had to submit proposals, attend meetings, and make presentations to  both the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy administration. In 1982, they received a 251-page rejection.</p>
<p>The election of Michael Bloomberg, in 2001, who was a fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, was the turning point.</p>
<p>Central Park was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was meant as a city refuge. It recalled ideas of the Victorian pastoral and picturesque.</p>
<p>People criticized <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> for interfering with man’s relationship with nature. But the irony is that Central Park itself was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as a city refuge.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Crossing</em></strong> by<strong> Bill Viola </strong>is a<strong> video/sound </strong>installation that uses a double-sided screen on a freestanding piece of clear acrylic. It was shot using high-speed film that achieved 300 frames per second in great detail. Viola reduced the speed of the playback to extremely slow motion. This enhances the drama. Sound amplifies the experience.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist wanted to create an immersive sound and video environment to dwell on transformation and change as well as growth and decay. These are inevitable processes.</p>
<p>Slow-motion is not just a technological choice. It is meant to invite a meditative and contemplative response. One that requires the viewer to concentrate for longer and slows us down. This increases our awareness of movement, detail, and change. This creates a connection between the artistic and spiritual experience. We could interpret it in a religious way, even though the work makes no direct iconographic or religious overtones.</p>

<p>There are two different video sequences that are simultaneously shown.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water + fire = duality</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>water video </strong>the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A trickle of water overhead appears until he disappears in a deluge. As the water ceases, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>In the <strong>fire video</strong> the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A flame starts at his feet and spreads over his legs and torso until he disappears in flames. As the fire dies down, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>This draws on universal truths about life and death from Eastern/Western traditions. Fire/water is a barrier between this world and the next. Humans struggle to survive both of these in disasters.</p>
<p><strong>Flames</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shiva Nataraja</li>
<li>Parliament</li>
<li>Chartres Cathedral (destruction, rebirth)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Biblical flood by Michelangelo</li>
<li>Great Wave</li>
<li>Basin</li>
<li>Slave Ship (destruction, cleansing)</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements  <strong>often symbolize change, redemption, transformation, and renewal.</strong></p>
<p>The act of self-annihilation in the figure’s disappearance serves as a metaphor for destruction of the ego.</p>
<p>The title <strong><em>The Crossing </em></strong>is in references to the crossing of an individual to a different state of being.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Describes a childhood experience of almost drowning as “beautiful” and “without fear”.</li>
<li>Viola is a devoted Zen Buddhist.</li>
<li>In college, he majored in religious studies, psychology, and electrical engineering&#8211; all clearly visible here.</li>
<li>Inspired by Nam June Paik, an early innovator in the field of video art.</li>
<li>Even though the art object has greatly changed, the themes of life, death, religion, redemption continue.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 10.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>In the scholarly realm, as well as in mainstream media, <strong>contemporary</strong> art is now a major phenomenon experienced and understood in a global context. Art history surveys have traditionally offered less attention to <strong>art made from 1980 to the present</strong>. Although such surveys often presented contemporary art as largely a European and American phenomenon, today, contemporary art produced by artists of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the First Nations is receiving the same, if not more attention.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First, <strong>the waning of colonialism</strong>, inaugurated by independence movements. Then there have been <strong>shifts in the balance of power</strong>. Think the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the rise of China. Additionally, the <strong>development of widespread communication</strong> <strong>networks</strong> such as the internet have all contributed. Contemporary art now represents a world that is global and interconnected rather than Eurocentric.</p>
<p>The art world has expanded and <strong>become more inclusive</strong> since the 1960s, as artists of all nationalities, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations have challenged the traditional privileged place of white, heterosexual men in art history. This activism has been supported by theories (e.g., deconstructionist, feminist, poststructuralist, and queer) that critique perspectives on history and culture that claim universality but are in fact exclusionary.</p>

<p><strong>Museum: </strong>MOMA</p>
<p><strong><em>Pink Panther</em></strong> by American artist<strong> Jeff Koons </strong>is a work using<strong> glazed porcelain </strong>that stands<strong> 3 feet by 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>The work was made in triplicate commercial production. It is highly polished and gleaming. The glossy texture makes it look factory-made, associated with cheap figurines. <strong>Kitsch,</strong> a word of German origin, refers to mass-produced imagery designed to please everyone.</p>
<p>The colors are garish and bright. Think toothpaste minty colors with yellow hair and bubblegum pink. Deliberately gaudy colors were common in kitsch/knickknacks/souvenirs. These were Inspired by German figurines.</p>
<p>Koons had a German workshop where making these figurines was a long-standing tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Pink Panther</em></strong> From a series called “Banality” created with the condition of being unoriginal, dull, stale, boring. The series consisted of 20 sculptures in porcelain and polychromed wood. There appeared to be nothing serious about any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Koons</strong> was doing what Duchamp did.</p>
<p><strong>How far could he take the definition of art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>This gave viewers a number of challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Challenged taste (high class/fine art) (tacky vs. classy).</li>
<li>Challenged originality (stole another’s image).</li>
<li>Challenged uniqueness of the individual art object (made 3 of them).</li>
<li>Challenged construction (didn’t make it himself).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Drew from pop culture to create a sculpture that comments on art and beauty as commodities.</li>
<li>Is a simple (or even tacky) appropriation of other people’s images made by other people art?
<ul>
<li>He is a critic of mass culture, and he reveals this by utilizing mass culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Capitalize on the recognizable to sell art.</li>
<li>“Marriage of pop culture and art-world elitism”.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pink Panther</strong> is a cartoon character from film/TV series in the 1960s/70s. The woman in the sculpture is</p>
<p><strong>Jayne Mansfield</strong> a 1960s B-list Hollywood star (and real-life mother of actress Mariska Hargitay who plays Olivia on Law &amp; Order: SVU!) Mansfield was a buxom platinum blond, known for wardrobe malfunctions.</p>
<p>Pink Panther is in an erotic pose with Mansfield, who is smiling, bare-breasted, and tilting her head back as if to smile at a crowd of onlookers. Her right hand covers her exposed breast. Pink Panther’s tail is tucking into the back of her dress.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This work was sold in 2014 to MOMA for $16,800,000. <strong>Koons</strong> was Gauguin-like in his intentional self-promotion. He took out ads in major art magazines and employed a PR/image consultant.</p>
<p>Accused of breaking copyright laws, <strong>Koons</strong> claimed fair use by parody. He was sued for copyright infringement and settled out of court.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong>  The expansion of art object/artist that challenges tradition. Appropriation is key.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trade (Gifts for Trading Land with White People) </em></strong>by artist <strong>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith </strong>is an artwork of<strong> oil and mixed media on canvas </strong>that measures<strong> 5 by 14 feet.   It is </strong>divided into three panels or a <strong>triptych</strong>.</p>
<p>Is this a painting? A collage? An installation? Is it all three?</p>
<p>This is what is known as an <strong>assemblage</strong>. This means bringing together a variety of media to make something 3D. It was inspired by AbEx painters with their energetic application of abstract brushstrokes.</p>
<p>This work <strong>uses white, yellow, green, and red paint.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Made as a response to the 500<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Columbus’s landing in the New World</strong></li>
<li>Part of a series called the <strong>Quincentenary Non-Celebration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Untold history of Native Americans</strong> being poorly compensated for their tribal lands</li>
<li>Smith offers up these cheap trinkets in exchange for the lands that were lost, reversing the historic sale of land for trinkets.</li>
<li>Smith said: “If the work could speak, it would say <em>Why won’t you white people consider trading the land we handed over to you for these silly trinkets? Sound like a bad deal? Well, that’s the deal you gave us.”</em></li>
<li>Native life has been commoditized, turning Native cultural objects into cheap items or logos or children’s toys without true understanding of what the intention originally was.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Covered with tribal newspaper articles about native life combined with images of stereotypical Native Americans from product designs and advertisements.</li>
<li>Newspaper articles about Natives, photos, comics, tobacco and gum wrappers, fruit carton labels, ads, pages from comic books, images of deer, buffalo, and Native men holding pipes in their hands.</li>
<li>Outline of a canoe has been painted: traditional form of native transportation (suggests possibility of trade) but canoe is stuck, there is no water.
<ul>
<li>Red in particular: referred to Native heritage, blood, warfare, anger, sacrifice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Above, a string lined with inexpensive toys that imitate traditional Native culture: toy tomahawks, a child’s headdress with brightly colored feathers, Red Man chewing tobacco, Washington Redskins cap and license plate, Florida State Seminoles bumper sticker, Cleveland Indians pennant and hat, Atlanta Braves license plate, beaded belt, toy quiver with arrows, plastic Indian doll.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artist is Native American</strong> and uses her cultural heritage with traditional art to make new media.</li>
<li>Her first name <strong>Jaune</strong> is the French word for yellow and a reference to her French-Cree heritage.</li>
<li>Her middle name <strong>Quick-to-see</strong> was given by her grandmother, who commented on her perception.</li>
<li>Received a BA in art education instead of studio because her instructors told her no woman could have a career as an artist, even though they acknowledged she had been better than all the men in the classes.</li>
<li><strong>Questions contemporary inequities</strong> that exist and that are rooted in colonial experiences.</li>
<li>References the role of trade goods in stories like the acquisition of Manhattan by Dutch colonists in 1626 for $24. Although the story is probably not true, it speaks to the idea that Native Americans were commonly lured off their land by what were in fact inexpensive trade goods.  They did not have the same understanding of private property as Europeans did. Remember Bandolier bag!</li>
<li><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> Art in a global context, with an expansion of art object/artist and social critique.</li>

<p><strong><em>Rebellious Silence</em></strong><strong>, from the Women of Allah series </strong>by<strong> Shirin Neshat (artist) </strong>and<strong> photo by Cynthia Preston </strong>is a work of<strong> ink on paper. </strong>The work is formally striking with hard edges of black color against a bright white background.</p>
<p>The portrait is bisected along a vertical seam created by the barrel of the rifle. The woman’s eyes stare at us from both sides of the divide.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>honors female revolutionaries</strong> on both sides in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It examines the complexities of <strong>women’s identities</strong> in the Middle East. <strong><em>Women of Allah series</em></strong> has allowed for a more complicated image of Middle Eastern women, and challenges the simplistic and stereotypical Islamic woman that the media has shown us.</p>
<p><strong>Duality between:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tradition/modernity</li>
<li>East/West</li>
<li>Beauty/violence</li>
<li>Sexuality/propriety</li>
<li>Freedom/oppression</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The artwork portrays female warriors of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in series called “Women of Allah”. It addresses <strong>four symbols that Westerners associate with the Muslim world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text </strong>covers part of her face that is usually covered by a niqab (traditional Muslim face scarf). The poetry is written by Iranian women about the revolution (Tahereh Saffarzadeh’s poem called <em>Allegiance with Wakefulness</em>).</p>
<p>Persian poetry is a rich tradition in Islam – Westerners do not know this history. Western viewers who do not read it will still understand the importance of Islamic script.</p>
<p>Post-1979 Iranian Revolution, all Muslim women were required to wear a <strong>veil</strong> in public.  Many Muslims found the practice empowering and affirmative of their religious identities, even though in the West we interpret this as oppressive.</p>
<p>The <strong>gun</strong> represents control and violence, but also religious martyrdom. We assume gun must mean violence right away. Westerners associate violence with jihad, although this is not the case. The rifle references the deliberate arming of Muslim women during the revolution.</p>
<p>Look at the <strong>woman’s gaze</strong>. Notice that in this image <strong>she STARES BACK</strong>.  Westerners assume she would/should be modest  and that she has been conditioned to be this way. Here she is retaking her body and freeing it from objectification</p>
<h5><strong>Iran in Context</strong></h5>
<p>Iran had been ruled by Shah (king) Pahlavi from 1941 – 1979. He was known for violent repression of Islamic religious freedom. Yet he FAVORED westernization. Iran was ally of both Britain and the US.  Women’s rights were promoted.</p>
<p>The 1979 Iranian Revolution was led by Ayatollah Khomeini. A very strict and conservative religious government dismantled Westernization.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Shirin Neshat </strong>was born in Iran in 1957 and raised in Westernization. She attended Catholic school to learn Western and Islamic history. Later, in the mid-1970s, she left Iran, moving to California, as attitudes towards the West grew increasingly hostile. She could not show her work in modern Iran as it was too dangerous.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What makes this Postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>This is an example of art in a global context, with an expansion of art object/artist, as well as social critique.</p>

<p><strong><em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop)</em></strong> by artist<strong> Pepon Osorio</strong> is a mixed-media installation. This large-scale work is immersive and visually opulent. It has been dubbed Nuyorican Baroque in reference to the opulence of New Spanish Baroque. It is meant to be entered and experienced by the viewer.</p>
<p>This work re-creates the artist’s memory of his first haircut at age 5, where he was told not to cry like a girl. He wanted to capture the limiting gender expectations of being male. There were only two options&#8211;being macho or being gay. The work challenge to the strong sense of machismo and homophobia in Latino communities. This is also a celebration of Nuyorican culture while at the same time offering a critique of it.</p>
<p>“Shop” <strong>contains images of Latino men</strong>, some crying and being bullied, and some men acting strong. There are powders that enhance male sexual performance and products for penile enhancement.</p>
<p>It is packed with <strong>masculine symbols</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>barber chairs</li>
<li>sports paraphernalia</li>
<li>depictions of sperm and circumcision</li>
<li>phallic symbols</li>
<li>tattoos</li>
<li>male action heroes</li>
<li>Puerto Rican flags</li>
<li>Baseballs</li>
<li>Framed portraits of famous Latino men.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also included videos playing interviews of Latino elder men from a retirement home nearby being asked about the idea of machismo and pro-traditionally defined masculinity.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pepon Osorio</strong> is a Puerto Rican born artist who was a social worker in the Bronx. He was not trained as an artist. He had a first-hand view of youth culture and the social expectations of his community. He lived in the Nuyorican Community (Puerto Ricans living in New York City) who have a distinct sense of cultural pride. Machoism is a central tenet of gender identity in this community.</p>
<p>The work was created in collaboration with local residents. They even <strong>offered haircuts to viewers in the opening art show.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object/artist and a social critique.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000)</em></strong> by Samoan artist<strong> Michel Tuffery, </strong>from New Zealand<strong>. </strong>It is a<strong> mixed media work </strong>made with<strong> found objects</strong> assembled and <strong>appropriated</strong> into <strong>sculpture in the round. </strong>It is made from flattened corned-beef tins joined by rivets. Notice how the coloration of the tins affects where it is placed, such as hooves, bodies or faces to provide contrast.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The work argues that foreign intervention and imperialism creates dependency. It teaches us about the impact of colonial economies in Pacific Island culture.</p>
<p>Imported commodities became integral parts of Polynesian customs of feasting and gift-giving. This replaced the tradition of tapa cloth. Due to the presence of Europeans harvesting and slaughtering techniques, also changed.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000)</em></strong> was named for the local Samoan term for canned goods. The term is derived from the Samoan version of “pea soup” which is <strong>pisupo. </strong>Pea soup was one of the first canned foods to be introduced by Europeans. Pisupo later meant “canned food” as a broad term.</p>
<p>A life-size bull is made from flattened cans of corned beef <strong>symbolizing that animals are just products to be sold</strong>. Using the title with 2000 in it makes us think about a modern, mass-produced commodity like a vacuum.</p>
<h5><strong>Changes Through Western Influence</strong></h5>
<p>The presence of Europeans/Westerners changed two things:</p>
<p><strong>Gift -giving</strong> typically included tapa cloth and Fijian mats, like in the Processional for Queen Elizabeth II.  Later Canned foods quickly became prestigious items used as ceremonial gifts in Samoa. Pisupo (canned foods) quickly replaced traditional indigenous foods and caused native practices to die out.</p>
<p><strong>Farming</strong> (harvesting/slaughtering) practices changed completely to be replaced by imported canned food.</p>
<h5><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>This is art in a global context with  and expansion of art object/artist, along with a social critique.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Centre Pompidou</p>
<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf</em></strong> by <strong>Kiki Smith </strong>is a work of<strong> ink and pencil on paper. The paper on this large-scale work </strong>does not have a nice finish and is left wrinkled. This is really just a sketch!</p>
<p>The negative space is great and undefined. There is no horizon line. The reclining nude contains little to no modelling.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work is <strong>a feminist approach and retelling of popular folktales</strong>. The associations with Woman and Nature mean that the woman is not the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Why are women in fairy tales always in danger or near death?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Snow White</li>
<li>Sleeping Beauty</li>
<li>Ariel</li>
<li>Cinderella</li>
<li>Little Red Riding Hood</li>
<li>Belle</li>
</ul>
<p>Women have been associated with nature. Why does this imply women wouldn’t understand it? A deeper connection?</p>
<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf </em></strong> references the tradition of the reclining female nude but transforms it. The work is  not sexualized. She doesn’t stare out but reclines with animal. The audience doesn’t matter, she pays them no mind.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>A reclining female nude lays intimately with a wolf. This is not about bestiality, however, but it is an act of bonding between humans (especially women) and nature. The wolf nuzzles her affectionately, much like she cuddles with a dog. She strokes his fur.</p>
<p>The woman has tamed the wolf’s wildness. Neither is a victim any longer. This is symbiotic.</p>
<p>Both figures seem to nurture one another. They are not stereotypically predator and prey. It’s hard to pick who would have been the prey anyway. Is it the woman because she is vulnerable? Is it the animal to show man’s power over nature?</p>
<h5><strong>References</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Little Red Riding Hood</em></strong> is a story that is normally quite violent and is now rendered sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Saint Genevieve</strong> the patron saint of Paris is associated with animals and her ability to domesticate wolves.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kiki Smith</strong> was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1954. She grew up, as part of an artistic family in an old Victorian house in New Jersey. It captured her imagination and inspired her to think of fairy tales and the feminist retellings. Her common subjects include fairy tales, women, animals, and Victorian literature.</p>
<h5><strong>What makes this postmodern? </strong></h5>
<p>Appropriation is key. There is an expansion of art object/artist and a social critique, as well as a revival of tradition.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong> is a<strong> mixed-media installation </strong>work by artist<strong> Yinka Shonibare </strong>measuring<strong> 10 feet tall. </strong>This is a 3D sculpture/ installation of a life-size headless female mannequin, installed in a corner of the gallery with foliage.  It is based on the iconic Rococo 1767 painting by Fragonard, <strong><em>The Swing. </em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a sculpture that is both familiar and strange to us. It <strong>draws our attention</strong> to the prominence of <strong>racism.</strong></p>
<p>It is jarring at first to see a black woman replace one of the most coquettish, erotic, and delicate women in the history of art. Why? We are not used to seeing black women in art as the main subject and especially in a glamorized and eroticized way.</p>
<p>As we participate in the voyeurism, we become like the man in the bush in <strong><em>The Swing.</em> </strong></p>
<p>This <strong>shows the multi-cultural, multi-racial world that we live in</strong>. The Identity is not singular, rather it is cross-cultural or multi-cultural. In this work we have a European painting and a black woman wearing Dutch wax (African fabric).</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Like Fragonard’s, <em>The Swing</em>, <strong>this work</strong> <strong>retains a woman on swing, a shoe mid-flight, and the foliage. </strong>What has been <strong>excluded are the men, much of the garden, the race of woman, the head and identical clothing.</strong></p>
<p>The woman is <strong>dressed in a traditional French Rococo style, but it is made with African fabric (called Dutch wax)</strong>. This is different from the decorative and frilly opulence in the original.</p>
<p><strong>The woman has no head</strong>. This may refer to the fate that awaited many Rococo aristocrats in the French Revolution&#8212; the guillotine!  <em>The Swing</em> was seen as the epitome of excess and extravagance in the Rococo.</p>
<p>The woman is black rather than white. There is a <strong>juxtaposition</strong> of something that is European with what is African.</p>
<h5><strong>What Makes this Postmodern? </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong> allows us to understand art in a global context. It has an expansion of art object/artist, as well as a social critique. Appropriations are common to show challenges to tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Not Originally African</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dutch Wax</strong> fabrics were made in the Southeast Asian Dutch/English colonies. These quickly became even cheaper to produce in African colonies. Production was moved there. Eventually, the bright patterning became distinctive and integrated into African clothing and used in African nationalist movements.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Yinka Shonibare </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">is a British-bo</span><strong>t the Artist</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">rn Nigerian who is sensitive to nationalism, identity, and race. Paralyzed on half of his body, he directs his artwork production to his studio.</span></p>
<p>The artist referred to himself as a hybrid. As an art student in London, his teacher told him to make work that expressed his African identity. This prompted him to think about stereotypes and the difficulties that exist for those who are multiracial.</p>

<p><strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> by artist<strong> El Anatsui </strong>is an art object made with<strong> aluminum and copper wire </strong>standing<strong> 16 feet tall. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>What is it? </strong></h5>
<p>A sculpture in 3D?  A painting to hang on the wall?  An installation?  Is it fine art or craft? Fabric? Post-Modernism purposefully disregards the limited categories imposed by Western art history.</p>
<p>This work is <strong>made from old liquor metal bottle caps</strong> and labels (<strong>modular)</strong>. ALL were found in  the Ghana bush (<strong>found object</strong>). The artist was careful to create <strong>bands of black, silver, gold, and red</strong>. These were fastened together with <strong>copper wire.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Construction</strong></h5>
<p>El Anatsui works in a warehouse. His assistants piece it together under his direction.</p>
<p>The artist <strong>never gives museums any hanging instructions</strong>.  The piece is always different when it is hung. <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> catches the light from every angle and creates a reflective surface.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bottle caps</strong> signify a fraught <strong>history of trade between Europe and Africa. </strong>European liquor was a major element of the transatlantic slave trade/Triangle Trade.</p>
<p><strong>Alcoholism</strong> is a significant problem in African communities. Just like <strong>Corned Beef 2000</strong>, globalization, and an introduction of Western goods into non-western regions has created both an imbalance and a dependency.</p>
<p>Anatsui’s cloths cause us to examine our conceptions of waste – appropriation/recycling of waste.</p>
<p>The title, <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> refers to the significance of textiles in African societies.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Part of a series called <strong>Gawu</strong> (the Ghanian word for metal cloth)</li>
<li>Pattern is based on <strong>kente cloth</strong> – traditional fabric in Ghana</li>
<li><strong>Gold colors</strong> also recall the colonial past of Ghana (previously called the Gold Coast by the British) until its independence in 1957.</li>
<li>The fluid movement of the work reminds the viewer of the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, which carried slave ships and trade ships from Africa to the New World.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>El Anatsui</strong> was born in Ghana in 1944. He trained in an academic European-style academy. In 1964, when he was beginning art school, many parts of Africa were pushing for independence and decolonization. He joined the <strong>Sankofa</strong> movement which worked to unearth and reclaim Africa’s rich artistic tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Men in Ghana weave fabrics</strong>. This is highly unusual because globally, this tends to be a women’s tradition.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> Expansion of artist/art object, the revival of tradition and social critique.</p>
<p>The Met owns two of Anatsui’s metal wall hangings, but two separate departments purchased them: Arts of Africa and Modern/Contemporary Art. Which one is more appropriate and why?</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Brooklyn Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong> by Kenyan artist<strong> Wangechi Mutu </strong>is an artwork created by using<strong> mixed media on mylar.  </strong>Here she used collage incorporating fragments from fashion magazines, specially colored paper and more.  This was applied to mylar, which is a soft reflective piece of plastic. (Balloons are made of mylar.)</p>
<p>The work has drips of white ink on top of colors. This is reminiscent of stars and constellations, with the connection of human form to the universe.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This takes the attitudes of gender, sexuality, and the female nude and complicates them. We are used to docile, sexual, attractive white women. This woman seems powerful, engaged, confident, and not white.</p>
<p>There is a twist on the tradition of female nudes. It takes a woman who is passive and makes her active.  She is now preying on and ensnaring men.</p>
<p>When we view her, we assume she is not white. Why? How can we tell what race she is at all ? If we assume she isn’t white, we subject her to not only sexism but racism as well.</p>
<h5><strong>What’s in a Title?</strong></h5>
<p>The title <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong> reminds the viewer of a praying mantis, when looking at the female’s bent legs.  <strong>Praying mantises</strong> camouflage themselves, then snare prey with their enormous legs. During mating, a female praying mantis becomes a sexual cannibal.</p>
<p>Is the subject our prey? We prey on her by gazing on her, but she seems powerful, strong,  and confident. Is this a message about men falling prey to sexual women? She ensnares men, like her insect counterpart.</p>
<h5><strong>Juxtapositions</strong></h5>
<p>The woman is full of <strong>juxtapositions,</strong> and a hybrid-like figure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexualized yet legs tightly crossed</li>
<li>Human yet not human-like (more of a creature)</li>
<li>Relaxed yet exposed</li>
<li>Physical yet flayed</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Skinless</strong></h5>
<p>The inner flesh is on the outside of her body. Removing her skin removes the idea of race. Then, the viewer can just focus on the woman, regardless of race or identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>blanket</strong> represents <strong>kuba cloth</strong>, a Kenyan style of cloth.</p>
<p>The <strong>tree</strong> reminds us of creation myths. It also connects women to nature. Her left hand holds a <strong>small green serpent</strong> which links this woman with Eve. It joins her to Western tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Artist Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Artist <strong>Wangechi Mutu</strong> was born in Nairobi, Kenya but educated in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>She spoke about how one of the effects of colonialism in Africa was to introduce European or white narratives to African history and visual arts. This had the negative effect of Africans viewing their own art through a European lens.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is this Postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em> </strong>there is appropriation, change of tradition and an expansion of  the artist.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 10.2 Purpose and Audience in Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>Diverse art forms are considered according to perceived similarities in form, content, and artistic intent over broad themes. This includes existential investigations and socio-political critiques, as well as reflections on the natural world, art’s history, popular and traditional cultures, and technological innovation<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The iconic building becomes a sought-after trademark for cities. Computer-aided design affects the diversity of innovative architectural forms, which tend toward the aspirational and the visionary. The worldwide proliferation of contemporary art museums, galleries, biennials and triennials, exhibitions, and print and digital publications has created numerous, diverse venues for the presentation and evaluation of art in today’s world.</p>
<p>Artists frequently use appropriation and “mash-ups” to devalue or revalue culturally sacred objects, and to negate or support expectations of artworks based on regional, cultural, and chronological associations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em></strong><em> by </em><strong>Maya Lin</strong> is comprised of <strong>granite</strong> and stands in <strong>Washington D.C., US</strong>. <strong>Each arm is 246 feet by 9 inches long. </strong></p>
<p>This work is a highly reflective <strong>black granite</strong> formed into a <strong>V-shaped wall</strong>.  It is <strong>sunk into the land</strong> rather than set on top of it. The two walls point towards either the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument. Where the walls meet, they are 10.1 feet high. Each wall slopes at the ends to less than a foot and is covered with <strong>text only</strong>. There are <strong>no images</strong>.</p>
<p>The work was inspired by <strong>Minimalism</strong>. This art movement that begins in the 1960s in the US, aims to eliminate all non-essentials in an artwork by reducing it to its most simple geometric elements. It goes further than Cubism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Lin had to create a way to <strong>commemorate loss</strong> without designing a memorial that would tell people what to think about Vietnam. It needed to be approachable and apolitical, with a focus on work being a place of mourning and healing.</p>
<p>The design does not aim to resolve conflicting emotions about the validity of the war. Instead, it is meant to be a space for catharsis, mourning and contemplation.</p>
<p>The viewer must engage with the work close up to interact with it. The reflection of the loved one’s name is a powerful reminder of their sacrifice for the country.</p>
<p>The <strong>sunken placement</strong> was meant to evoke <strong>a spiritual journey</strong> for the viewer. They enter and sink deeper to reflect on the death of the soldiers. The living are carrying on the memory.  It also signifies a deep cut in the earth that will heal over time, but <strong>there will always be a scar.</strong></p>
<p>The wall was intentionally made reflective and shiny. The names of the dead literally comprise our bodies’ reflection. The message is we are here because of their sacrifice.  While we see reflections, they are not as clear as a mirror.  It is as if we are gazing into a ghostly realm.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The single memorial device used is <strong>text not imagery.</strong> Visitors read the names of those lost, engraved in chronological order.</p>

<p><em>Thus, the war’s beginning and end meet; the war is ‘complete,’ coming full circle yet broken by the earth that bounds the angle’s open side and continued with the earth itself.</em></p>
<p>The work was intentionally shaped like a book. Visitors read names from left to right. <strong>There are 72 panels containing 58,286 names.</strong> These names are listed in order of when the men and women died or were declared missing. There have been periodic additions.</p>
<p>The growth of the structure <strong>perfectly parallels the number of deaths</strong>, almost like a timeline. The lowest number of deaths are shown at the beginning and end, with the greatest number in the middle.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial </em></strong><em>was </em>designed by a 21-year-old Yale University junior named <strong>Maya Lin</strong>, in 1981. She was still a student at Yale’s School of Architecture. The work was made for a public design competition. Her professor had assigned this as a project for his students. (Meanwhile, she only received a B+ grade on it from the professor!)</p>
<p>Her design was one of over 2,573 submissions, in response to a call for entries by the US government.</p>
<p>The idea came from the Yale Memorial Rotunda. Alumni who had been killed in war have their names inscribed on the walls. She used to touch the names and feel contemplative.</p>
<p>She did not do any specific research on the war because she felt politics had eclipsed the veterans. She wanted the focus to remain on the deceased.</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was a disaster on all counts. Most Americans believed the war was a moral tragedy. All of America knew it had been lost. Most opposed to the war did not blame the soldiers but the government, although some did attack soldiers or disrespect them upon their return. The vets were angry with the lack of respect and distraught about the great loss.</p>
<p>The average age of names on the wall is 19.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for a US soldier upon putting their boots on the ground in Vietnam was 1 month.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Vast Criticism</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Lin was resoundingly <strong>criticized for this work.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>black color </strong>was said to not match with the rest of the US Mall. It was called “black gash on Mall”.</p>
<p>People interpreted the color black as a symbol of shame and dishonor over the war. Lin meant it as a sign of mourning. Additionally, black was seen as a color in Asian art, and was not typical in American, Western, or classical art&#8211;that color would have been white.</p>
<p>The work was considered <strong>nonrepresentational and not traditional</strong>.  It lacked ornamentation and did not follow traditional funerary sculpture. Many thought the design was too simple and did not depict honor and sacrifice in a traditional way.</p>
<p>War veterans wanted a traditional and realistic sculpture. One is added off to the side to assuage concerns.</p>
<p>People wondered why a young Asian American woman from an Ivy League college who did not know the realities of war was the artist. Why would she be picked to design a monument about deaths in an Asian war?</p>
<p>Building permits were refused. It took a 4 Star Brigadier General to testify before subcommittee hearings and defend the color before the project moved forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maya Lin</strong><em> said, “It took me 9 months to ask the VVMF, in charge of building the memorial, if my race was an issue. It had never occurred to me that it would be, and I think they had taken all the measures they could to shield me from comments about a “gook” designing the memorial. I remember reading the article that appeared in The Washington Post referring to “An Asian Memorial for an Asian War” and I knew we were in trouble.” </em><em> </em></p>
<p>She continued by saying<em>, “The controversy exploded in Washington after that. Ironically, one side attacked the design for being “too Asian,” while others saw its simplicity and understatement, not as an intention to create a more Eastern, meditative space, but as a minimalist statement which they interpreted as being non-referential and disconnected from human experience. This left the opinion in many that the piece emanated from a series of intellectualized aesthetic decisions, which automatically pitted artist against veterans. The fact that I was from an Ivy League college and had hair down to my knees further fueled this distrust of the design and suspicions of a hippie college liberal or aesthetic elitist forcing her art and commentary upon them.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> British Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Summer Trees</em></strong> by <strong>Song Su-nam</strong> is an <strong>ink on paper</strong> artwork that measures <strong>2 feet tall</strong>. It uses broad, vertical, and elongated parallel brush strokes of ink. The strokes blend, overlapping and bleeding with one another using a monochromatic palette of velvety blacks and grays.</p>
<p>Blurry, feathery edges reveal pale washes applied to wet paper. The crisper lines are ones that were applied to dry paper. Formal simplicity and abstraction of <strong>Abstract Expressionists</strong> combined with <strong>subtle tonal variation of Asian ink paintings</strong> are combined in this work.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Song felt that materials and styles of the West, though popular in Korea, did not express his identity.</p>
<p>So, he blended the two together.</p>
<p><strong>Korean</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>medium of ink</li>
<li>paper</li>
<li>subject</li>
<li>symbolism</li>
<li>blacks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>West</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>style</li>
<li>abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>This was part of a movement called <strong>Sumukwha</strong> to recover a national identity through art. This work has allusions to scholars and friendship. It could be Song’s statement of optimism in the rediscovery of traditional values through this group.</p>
<p>It references the tradition of <strong>literati (scholar-artist)</strong>. Song was considered a <strong>modern literati</strong>. Even though we spoke of literati with <em>Travels Among Mountains and Streams</em>, remember <strong>sinification</strong> brought Chinese culture to Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The title <strong><em>Summer Trees</em></strong> refers to the natural world and the highly stylized trees with thick foliage and trunks. In Korean and Chinese tradition, <strong>a group of pine trees</strong> can symbolize a gathering of honorable friends, or friends who are wise and intellectual.</p>
<p>Mountainous landscapes and plants serve as metaphors for the ideal qualities of literati:</p>
<ul>
<li>loyalty</li>
<li>intelligence</li>
<li>strength</li>
<li>honor</li>
</ul>
<p>Literati lived lives connected to nature and away from the chaos of urban life.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Song Su-nam</strong> was a leader of the <strong>Sumukhwa movement</strong> of the 1980s. Sumukhwa was a movement to recover national identity through reviving traditional Korean art as Western modernism/abstraction was becoming increasingly popular across Korea. It is a Korean term for ink wash painting aka literati painting.</p>
<p><strong>Why was Westernization growing? </strong>After the Korean War, a growing American presence in South Korea brought with it an increase of Westernization. Many were concerned that traditional Korean culture was disappearing.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong>  This is art in a global context, and an expansion of art object/artist. It is a social critique.</p>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The <strong>audience is united</strong> by their illiteracy. We end up searching for what does not exist – an understanding of this text and history.</p>
<p>The work <strong>upholds the ancient Daoist belief</strong> that the deepest truths can never be captured by words alone. <strong>This is a critique</strong> of the meaninglessness of contemporary political language and as a commentary on the illegibility of the past.</p>
<p><strong>It draws attention</strong> to the erasing of history under Mao’s Communist regime. In this way, people cannot learn about the history of China, as we cannot read these texts. It represents a loss of meaning and culture.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>In ancient Chinese art, <strong>squares symbolized earth</strong>. Look at how the books are arranged on the ground, and long swoops and curves indicate Heaven. Look how the scrolls are arranged overhead.</p>
<p><strong>“Sky book”</strong> in Chinese means something that is incomprehensible. It’s an inspiration from the title.</p>
<p>Also, it is an allusion to the texts suspended overhead.</p>
<p>There are 4,000 characters created to appear to be real but are unreadable and meaningless. They are meant to mimic traditional Chinese fonts and lettering. Even the way he arranged the texts looks like they are real. Volume 2 is organized like Chinese medical texts, while Volume 3 is like literary texts.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Xu Bing </strong>Grew up surrounded by books in Beijing. His father was a historian, and his mother was a librarian.</p>
<p>During <strong>Mao’s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)</strong>, millions of students/professors were sent to rural villages and work camps. Mao also destroyed Chinese text, art, and histories through the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>In 1975, Xu Bing is separated from his family and forced into agricultural labor at a commune. In 1977, he was able to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing for his bachelors in Printmaking. He trained in social realism and propaganda art. He made his name as a “radical” and “avant-garde” artist.</p>
<h5><strong>What makes this postmodern? </strong></h5>

</ul>
<p><em>“Chairman Mao’s radical transformation of Chinese culture was most deeply rooted in his transformation of language.

<p><strong><em>Untitled (#228)</em></strong> from the History Portraits series by American artist <strong>Cindy Sherman</strong> is a work of <strong>photography </strong>that measures <strong>6 feet eight inches by 4 feet.</strong></p>
<p>The artwork is <strong>based on a Botticelli painting. </strong>The figure is pushed forward on the picture plane, and it is well-lit. The colors of <strong>red, blue, yellowish gold are prominent</strong>. The upper body is in a triangular composition. The size, lighting, color, and composition are all supposed to be similar to Old Master paintings. The size is equal to a Grand Manner/history painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>From the <strong>“History Portraits”</strong> series – the artist draws inspiration from the history of art. Each work is <strong>based on an Old Master</strong> masterpiece showing her in it. She portrays a feminist hero. Many of her photographs show stereotypes of women or traditionally strong women.</p>
<p>Judith has traditionally been viewed as strong, but alternatively dangerous and sexual.</p>
<p>She <strong>blends aspects of painting with photography</strong>. By creating a photograph modeled after a painting, she becomes a prop even though we assume photography is truthful. We are supposed to realize photography is as much a construct as painting was.</p>
<p>When critiquing the photography, we cannot avoid the fact it can be heavily manipulated. But it also argues for the legitimacy of photography as artistic. If photography can replicate a painting, then photography must have some merits and must be like painting.</p>
<p>This work depicts as reality something that was originally a painting. It presents painting via photography.  Photography cannot be inherently trusted even though this is generally our attitude. (Think magazines and social media).</p>
<p>What Cindy Sherman is really doing is what Daguerre tried to do. That is to illustrate that photography can replicate painting.</p>
<h5><strong>What We See</strong></h5>
<p>This replicates <strong>the story of Judith and Holofernes</strong>. Judith was a heroine in the bible who slayed the Assyrian general, Holofernes. She got him drunk, seduced him, and then beheaded him.</p>
<p>The artist depicts herself in costume, standing in front of textiles in the background This was typical of Baroque art. <strong>Sherman</strong> wears Renaissance-era fashion, consisting of a red-satin dress, with an empire waistline, cinched by a dark blue sash. In her hand is the head (mask) of Holofernes, who is old and wrinkled. In the other hand, she holds a bloody knife.</p>
<p>She stares forward with a blank expression, with a heavily made-up face. Her eyebrows are thin, and her lips are painted red.</p>
<p>Her bare feet point outward and are out of proportion. This might be a reference to early Renaissance difficulties with foreshortening.</p>
<h5><strong>Feminist Art</strong></h5>
<p>Feminist art aims to look back through the canon of art history and draws attention to women through women’s stories, female subjects, and female artists. Popular subjects are the same as during the Renaissance and Baroque period, which were popular stories of strong Biblical women.</p>
<h5><strong>The Book of Judith</strong></h5>
<p>The book of Judith from the Old Testament recounts the story of Judith. To save her people from the Assyrian king, she seduced her way into the tent of the general Holofernes. She then got him drunk and beheaded him. She triumphantly returned with the head to show her people.</p>
<p>The story symbolized triumph over tyranny (much like David and Goliath), and the dangers of femininity.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> National Museum of Australia</p>
<p><strong><em>Earth’s Creation</em></strong> by Australian Aboriginal artist<strong> Emily Kame Kngwarreye </strong>is a work of<strong> synthetic polymer paint on canvas </strong>that measures<strong> 20 by 9 feet. </strong></p>
<p>What makes this postmodern?  This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object/artist.</p>
<p>The work is purely abstract and nonrepresentational. There are gestural marks, and each swatch traces the movement of her own hands or brush. She laid the canvas on the ground and sat on it or beside it while she painted.</p>
<p>The work has often been compared to AbEx though she knew nothing about it. It is similar in canvas size, gestural strokes and is an action painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the study of the landscape with the inspiration of colors, seasons, and sensations. The work depicts stories and elements of her cultural heritage. It captures the ways she was influenced by the environment.</p>
<p>The work promotes <strong>sand-painting or dot-painting</strong>, which is an indigenous technique.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Uses the traditional dot-work pattern typical in traditional Aboriginal Australian artwork</li>
<li>All works are influenced by landscapes</li>
<li>This one represents the lushness of “green time” after periods of heavy rain by using tropical blues, yellows, greens, vibrant reds.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Kngwarreye (Ung-WAAR-ay) was an aboriginal artist completely untrained who did not paint until she was 80 years old. It is estimated that she produced over 3,000 paintings during her short eight-year painting career.</p>
<p>She was the first Aboriginal artist whose work broke the million-dollar mark at auction when this was sold in 2007.</p>
<p>Born in 1910, she spent 66 years as a forced laborer on European pastoral estates. When she was “freed,” she began to learn about ceremonial paintings and began working in batiks (dyed cloths) first, as well as ceremonial sand paintings.</p>
<p>One of her works was selected for the cover of an exhibition catalog. Critics lauded the piece and virtually overnight, she achieved acclaim.</p>
<h5><strong>The Culture</strong></h5>
<p>Aboriginal culture is intimately connected to the landscape of Australia such as deserts and grasslands. Landscape is a common subject in Aboriginal art.</p>

<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> by American architect<strong> Frank Gehry was constructed using titanium, glass, and limestone. </strong>This example of Post-Modern architecture stands in<strong> Bilbao, Spain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism</strong> used organic, rounded forms with asymmetrical designs rather than Modernist crisp, clean, long, straight lines.</p>
<p>This style is called <strong>deconstructivism</strong>. There is a bending and twisting of traditional styles to create a new aesthetic. This creates an unstable environment with unusual spatial arrangements. It looks bulging, warped, curling, tumbling. This is surprising to us because the look of the building disrupts our assumption that architecture is inherently stable.</p>

<p>Gehry described this work as “<strong>form follows fantasy</strong>”. It is a non-traditional building in both design and materials. He used a computer program called <strong>Catia</strong>, originally invented for aerospace engineering to design buildings.</p>
<p>The shiny <strong>titanium</strong> tiles that sheathe the building give it strength and shine. The look was inspired by the scales of fish. The fishing industry/shipbuilding industry was once a major part of Bilbao’s economy.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This building was constructed to serve as <strong>a museum of modern and contemporary art. </strong>The Guggenheim collection in NYC was too large for their space. This housed the overflow.</p>
<p>This building challenged the traditions of museum design and the thinking that it should be classical in form.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao </em></strong>is based on the curvature of the Guggenheim Museum in NYC. It also takes design cues from the Italian Baroque style of drapery and fabric, with bending, rippling, and unfurling.</p>
<p>Notice how the building <strong>looks like a ship</strong>. It is set by the water. The reflective quality of the building was intended to show the glittering water and sun’s reflection.</p>
<p>The<em> Spider </em>sculpture in front is entitled “Maman” by Louise Bourgeois. It means mother in French and was designed to show vulnerability, lightness, negative space.</p>
<p>The architect wanted to <strong>remove historical references</strong>. Most museums were done in variants of Neoclassicism – stone structures with pedimented fronts, colonnades, lofty and rational spaces.</p>
<p>The <strong>layout</strong> was an arrangement to focus on a central atrium with the 165-foot entrance.  This serves as a circulation hub and orientation gallery, providing access to the other 20 galleries on three levels.</p>
<p>The <strong>exhibition spaces </strong>have surprising shapes and does not follow the white cube method. Instead, it uses angled or curving walls and balconies. It is a complex and somewhat chaotic interior, with twisting glass-and-steel walls. It does not follow traditional Neoclassical design.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The building was very well received and the benefit to local economy was immediate and substantial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> was part of an ambitious urban renewal program to help the aging port and industrial city that had experienced significant decline in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Geographically, the location provided cheap land for a major museum, as opposed to a thriving European or American city. Deconstructivism’s fragmented forms represented uncertainty of contemporary life, like the downfall of Soviet Union the Berlin Wall and the 1987 stock market.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pure Land</em></strong> by artist <strong>Mariko Mori</strong> is a <strong>color photograph on glass</strong> measuring <strong>10 by 20 feet.</strong></p>
<p>Because it is printed on glass, the work has a shiny, reflective quality. The image was created using digital imagery and computer graphics. The huge scale uses the old art historical mentality that the size of the work indicates grandness, and significance.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This piece merges consumerism, entertainment, and traditional Japanese imagery together. It creates a modern space for and approach to Enlightenment. It shows we too can achieve Enlightenment in the modern age. This is a fusion of Japanese pop culture and traditional Japanese Buddhism.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>A female figure floats above a golden landscape above a lotus blossom. Six aliens play instruments and whirl. The artist depicted herself as <strong>Kichijoten, </strong>the <strong>Japanese goddess</strong> of happiness, fertility, beauty. Originally this was an Indian goddess incorporated into Buddhism. The pink and peach clothing mirrors the orange, yellow, and rose gold of the landscape.</p>
<p>The Dead Sea landscape, in which the image is set, is the lowest point on earth. Its high salinity does not support fish or plant life. In Shinto tradition, salt is used as purification in ceremonies.</p>
<p>The <strong>empty landscape</strong> is a reference to the Buddhist idea of emptiness that creates a calm state. <strong>Lotus blossom</strong> is a symbol of purity and rebirth. It is also a reference to Buddhism. <strong>Futuristic spacecraft</strong> may be a variation on a stupa the sacred Buddhist monument originally used as a reliquary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pure Land</em></strong> is the title, as well as the place where Buddhist devotees go after death. This is a common artistic subject in Japan. In these images, Buddha rested on a lotus blossom, surrounded by Bodhisattvas, the enlightened beings who do not pass on to nirvana. Pastel-colored aliens act as the Bodhisattva while Mori acts as Buddha. The figures are a reference to Japanese manga (graphic novels) and anime (films and TV).</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mariko Mori</strong> was born in Tokyo in 1967. She studied fashion and design and worked as a fashion model. Mori began to stage elaborate photo shoots, where she acted as director, producer, set designer, costume designer, and model.</p>
<p>The major question in post-WWII Japan is&#8211; <strong>how do we retain tradition and legacy, but modernize?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object and artists.  Appropriation is key. There is a social critique as well as a revival of tradition.</p>

Materials with significance</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkytown Rebellion</em></strong> by artist <strong>Kara Walker</strong> is a <strong>cut paper and projection on wall</strong> measuring <strong>37 feet wide</strong>. It occupies a 37-foot-wide corner of a gallery. Colors are projected on a wall full of black silhouettes made of paper. These were deliberately made to be reminiscent of the Victorian era, which was the era of slavery.</p>
<p>Silhouettes were an inexpensive alternative to painted photographic portraits. Traditionally, they were a bust profile, cut out, affixed to a non-black background, and framed.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The viewer is forced to become a part of the scene. As we walk in front of it, we cast our own shadows.</p>
<p>It is impossible for us to ignore the history of slavery and we must choose what kind of player we will be.</p>
<p>The use of black paper is not just a reference to old Victorian silhouettes. These stories of slaves have been forgotten with no identifying information. The figures have become types. We will never know all of their stories.</p>
<p>Notice how quickly we recognize our stereotypes. We cannot see what race these figures actually are, and yet based upon their stereotypical features, we project information upon them. This work uses stereotypes to challenge how comfortable and recognizable they are.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This work depicts a scene from the pre-Civil War South. It shows slaves engaged in various acts of rebellion. At first glance, the colors and active figures make us think it is a parade or circus. Upon closer inspection, we realize this is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>There are 13 characters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flag bearers</li>
<li>Master taunting starving slave children</li>
<li>Nursing mother</li>
<li>Woman in hoop skirt attacking smaller slave</li>
<li>Various mutilated body parts</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject is a mix of fact and fantasy meant to evoke an emotional response. This is based on historical accounts of slave rebellions. Except for the outline of the bodies, all the subjects’ facial details are lost. The sitters are reduced to a few characteristics.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kara Walker</strong> is a famous multi-media artist who works with paper and black stereotypes. She is highly controversial for her role in drawing attention and perpetuating stereotypes. She argues that</p>
<p>we are so familiar with African American stereotypes such as Uncle Tom, Mammie, and Aunt Jemima.</p>
<p>Inspired by an anonymous 19<sup>th</sup> century landscape painting with African American caricatures painted into it entitled <strong><em>Darkytown</em></strong>, she began to read about slave rebellions and accounts. Responding to continued contemporary racial violence in the US, our role in racism is important and still relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> was in the Tate Modern</p>
<p><strong><em>Shibboleth</em></strong> by <strong>Doris Salcedo</strong> is an installation work of art measuring <strong>548 feet</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>temporary 548-foot-long series of fissures and cracks</strong> of varying width was in the floor of the gallery. This made viewers question it. Is it sculpture? Is it installation? Is it architecture?</p>
<p><strong>Can you make art by breaking it?</strong> This is so different from the “art is constructed/made” mentality.  Particularly with buildings, we associate cracks with structural cracks and danger. The crack was filled in but is still visible.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Produced for the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall (main hall).</li>
<li>Salcedo says this represents the immigrant experience and visibly shows separations, cracks, lack of unity.</li>
<li>Calls attention to divisions in ethnicity, politics, class, and culture.</li>
<li>Immigration marks people as “broken,” not “wholly a part of the group”.</li>
<li>Scars are a symbol of damage but also of the possibility of healing. Figurative and literal wounds, but also figurative and literal closure. That scar will always be there, always acting as a reminder.  We can cross over the divide to enact healing.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Shibboleth</strong> was the word used to distinguish people who belong from those who do not</p>
<p>Among the US military, the word lollapalooza was used during WWII since its tricky pronunciation could identify Asian speakers very clearly.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Salcedo was a Columbian immigrant living in the US and Europe</p>
<p>This work shows the fear of vulnerability, fear of being seen as different, as other, as an outcast, or as an immigrant. Sometimes there is a real danger to being seen as a foreigner and to being exposed. This speaks to the immigrant/refugee crises in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, but really since WWII.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this post-modernism?</strong>  There is an enlarge definition of art object/artist, globalization and social critique.</p>

<p><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts</strong> created by architect <strong>Zaha Hadid</strong> was constructed by using glass, steel, and cement. The building stands in <strong>Rome, Italy.</strong></p>
<p>You will notice in this work of <strong>Neo-Futurism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coiling, curving, elongated tube-like structures, fluid flow</li>
<li>Encourages free circulation</li>
<li>Futuristic with sharp edges/ De-emphasizes traditional elements like hallways or entryways</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Building has an L-shaped footprint with bending oblong tubes that overlap and intersect with each other</li>
<li>Pathways through the building overlap and connect to create a dynamic space</li>
<li>Continuity of space makes traditional galleries and exhibitions difficult</li>

<p>The building houses galleries, permanent collections, temporary exhibitions, auditorium, reception services, a cafeteria, and bookshop. The Tiber River runs by.  Rivers are a metaphor for the whole building with twisting and curving lines.</p>
<h5><strong>Context  </strong></h5>
<p>The building cost 130 million Euros to develop.</p>
<p>There is a Post-Modern interest in creating spaces that are functional, flexible, free of historical association, and that act as community gatherings.</p>
<p>Outside a pedestrian walkway follows the outline of the building. It is built on the site of an Italian military barracks. This reclaims the space for the community&#8212; Just like Forbidden City, Dream of a Sunday Afternoon, Colosseum…</p>
<h5><strong>About the Architect </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Zaha Hadid (1950–2016)</strong> was an architect  who created striking structures in major cities, as well as gracefully designed products such as furniture, jewelry, lighting, and shoes. Other buildings of note include Beijing&#8217;s Galaxy Soho, the London Aquatics Center, and the Guangzhou Opera House.</p>

Revival of tradition</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> was in the Tate Modern Turbine Hall</p>
<p><strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds)</em></strong> by Chinese artist <strong>Ai Weiwei</strong> is a work that consists of <strong>100 million sunflower seeds</strong> made from <strong>sculpted and painted porcelain. </strong>Each was handcrafted and hand painted. Each one is essentially individual and unique.</p>
<p>The artist worked with 1600 artisans in Jingdzhen, the city known as the “Porcelain Capital” where Chinese artists produced pottery for 2,000 years. <strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds) </em></strong>provided employment for people in this city, while Ai Weiwei oversaw the production.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this work Post-Modern?</strong> This is a global artist, with a new art object, representing social critique, with a revival of tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The work is a critique on political and economic injustice. There is a sense of the small, tiny parts that make up the whole. Though each is incredibly small, they create a feeling of vastness.</p>
<p>Here there is a comparison between the individual vs. the group. The individual seed is lost among the millions. The critique of conformity and censorship is inherent in modern China. People who are unique must be the ones to cause change.</p>
<p>The artists used traditions of the past (traditional ceramic art) to critique Mao and communist history.</p>
<p>Mao tried to destroy traditional Chinese traditions and art. He failed.</p>
<p>People could touch, lay, walk on, and interact with the work. The viewer became a part of the experience. Initially, this was allowed but about a week into the exhibition, they realized this was crushing the seeds and the ceramic dust was toxic.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>100 million individual sunflower seeds weighing 150 tons</li>
<li>Each sunflower seed is porcelain</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why sunflower seeds?</strong> Sunflower seeds evoke Mao’s Communist propaganda (Mao was rendered as the sun and the citizens were sunflowers, turning their faces to Mao. Seeds show the promise of something that can grow and become. Seeds make plants self-perpetuating, but these seeds cannot grow anything.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a symbol of imperial culture in China. It was an important way that the West began to be exposed to Chinese art. The use of porcelain also comments on the long history of this prized material while also cleverly still being “Made in China”.</p>
<p>In the Cultural Revolution, Mao tried to destroy these traditions by destroying Chinese art. In 2011, Ai Weiwei was arrested for three months. He was released due to pressure from the art world. On his blog, he investigated the cover-ups and corruption in the government’s handling of a 2008 earthquake in China, as well as the country’s hosting of the Olympics.</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Revolution led to Ai Weiwei’s father, an esteemed poet in China, being sent to a communist labor camp. Before he died, Ai Weiwei’s father gave his son permission to speak out about Mao’s injustices and conformity in China. Ai Weiwei is following a Confucian tenet&#8211;respect for elders.</p>

<p>Contemporary art refers to the art and architecture of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century to the present. However, it is very diverse and constantly changing. How do contemporary artists move beyond traditional concepts about art and artists? How do information technology and global awareness together shape contemporary art?

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Global contemporary art</strong> is characterized by <strong>a transcendence of traditional conceptions of art</strong>. It is supported by technological developments and global awareness.</p>
<p>Hierarchies of materials, tools, function, artistic training, style, and presentation are challenged. Questions about <strong>how art is defined, valued, and presented</strong> are provoked by:</p>
<ul>
<li>ephemeral digital works,</li>
<li>video-captured performances</li>
<li>graffiti artists</li>
<li>online museums, and galleries</li>
<li>declines in (but preservation of) natural materials and traditional skills</li>
<li>predominance of disposable material cultures</li>
<li>the digital divide— access or lack of access to digital technology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital technology</strong> provides increased access to imagery and contextual information about diverse artists and artworks throughout history and across the globe.</p>

Portrait</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> The Broad in LA</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players </em></strong>by artist <strong>Jean-Michel </strong>Basquiat is an <strong>acrylic and oil paintstick on three canvas panels</strong> measuring <strong>18 feet by 6 feet 3 inches.  Paintstick</strong> is a “crayon” with various oils/pigments mixed in. This allows the artist to draw oil paint.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> is a<strong> triptych</strong> with a flat, dark background color uniting all three panels. Each canvas has flat patches of color and dense thick lines.</p>
<p>This <strong>Neo-Expressionism</strong> work retains rough handling, jagged forms and jarring color, but now has a focus on the body. Pride of place has made an exit as the important figures are off to the sides. Large sections of white paint seem to obscure what was underneath.</p>
<p>There is no sense of scale or balance. The artist relies heavily on juxtaposition and contrast to make the painting dynamic and expressive. The traditional approach to 3D space is gone.</p>
<h5><strong>What is the Function of <em>Horn Players</em>?</strong></h5>
<p>This work connects <strong>graffiti with jazz and fine art. </strong>Through this it elevates the practice of graffiti itself to a fine art. It also connects <strong>jazz to African American culture</strong> thereby honoring African American history and contributions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> was inspired by the scatting and improvisational work performed in jazz. <strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> replicates that technique here.</p>
<h5><strong>Up Close </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>On the <strong>left panel</strong> Charlie Parker (saxophonist) plays his instrument and emits hot pink notes and sounds. On the <strong>central panel</strong> an abstracted head floats in space.</p>
<p>On the <strong>right panel</strong> Dizzy Gillespie (trumpeter) holds his trumpet along his side. The words DOH SHOO DE OBEE floats to the left. This reminds the viewer of Gillespie’s scat as a wordless improvisation.</p>
<h5><strong>Wordplay </strong></h5>
<p>A number of words appear on the canvases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dizzy</li>
<li>Ornithology (study of birds, as well as the title of a famous composition by Charlie Parker in reference to his own nickname Bird)</li>
<li>Pree (Parker’s daughter)</li>
<li>Teeth</li>
<li>Alchemy</li>
<li>Feet</li>
<li>Soap</li>
<li>Larynx misspelled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wordplay</strong> is a characteristic of Basquiat’s work, yet not all fully understood.</p>
<h5><strong>Common Subject Matter</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Musicians </strong>were a common subject for Basquiat. He had briefly played in a band. <strong>Anatomical terms</strong> were also common. His mother bought him a <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> textbook as a child for fun.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity to Picasso’s <em>Horn Players</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on <strong>Basquiat</strong> being called black the Picasso</li>
<li>We must draw upon our knowledge of traditional painting to understand this work</li>
<li>Triptych format echoes the trio of figures</li>
<li>Parker is in the same position as the standing figure with the clarinet in Picasso’s work</li>
<li>Central figure in Basquiat’s work is likened to the distorted face of the middle figure in Picasso’s</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Emergence of Urban Graffiti</strong></h5>
<p>Urban graffiti was an emerging artform in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Basquiat was one of the leaders.</p>
<h5><strong>About Jean-Michel Basquiat </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Basquiat</strong> was a homeless NYC queer man of color. He was a <strong>graffiti artist, sex worker and poet</strong>. Discovered in 1981 at age 20, he becomes dazzlingly successful at quick speed.</p>
<p>He was known for his tag SAMO (Same Old Shit) written in marker and spray paint on subway trains, sidewalks, and gallery walls. This attracted the attention of gallery owners and the art world.</p>
<p>Based on his success, critics referred to him as the “black Picasso”. While this likened him to Picasso, Basquiat felt conflicted about this term, because the word black was added.</p>
<p>He once said, “If you wanna talk about influence, man, then you’ve got to realize that influence is not influence. It’s simply someone’s idea going through my new mind.”</p>
<p>Some of his paintings have sold for $20 million. The artist died at the age of 27 from a heroin overdose.</p>
<h5><strong>Art News Update!</strong></h5>
<p>Andy Warhol’s portrait of Jean-Michel Basquiat was up for auction at Christie’s in November 2021.  The pre-estimate was US$20 million.</p>
<p>“From Brooklyn to China, Basquiat symbolizes a new generation, and Warhol recognized this earlier than anyone. His unmatched ability to capture celebrity, fame, glory, and tragedy culminates in this portrait,” Alex Rotter, Christie’s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art, said in a statement. “Just as much about Basquiat as it is about Warhol, it is one of the most exciting paintings to come to the auction market.”</p>
<p>How much did it sell for?</p>
<p>How much did it sell for? <strong>$40,091,500!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Metropolitan Museum of Art <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Androgyne III</em></strong> by artist<strong> Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>is a work comprised of<strong> burlap, resin, wood, nails, and string </strong>measuring<strong> 4 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> burlap</strong> is manipulated into a figurative composition. It is meant to appear rough and course. This is an abstracted, simplified, dramatically reduced figure that is hollow with no head, forearms, or shins. A mold process was used to make the form out of burlap, with resin to stiffen it.</p>
<p>This  is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round</strong> and can also be viewed from the back.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is this Neo-Expressionism? </strong></h5>
<p>This work is a return to the body and the expressive capabilities of the bodies. This was believed to have been lost in Pop Art and Site-Specific Art. It is <strong>a rejection of the modernist attitude that the body is dead</strong>. Additionally, the style is a revival of Expressionism, with rough, jagged handling, and sharp forms. <strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This work examines the <strong>relationship between individual and community</strong> (isolation and loss). It notes <strong>dehumanization and lack of identity</strong> are the result of strife, war, anguish and derision.</p>
<p>It <strong>depicts isolation and loss</strong> in a universal way. We cannot identify this figure specifically. So much of this figure has been lost, destroyed and hurt. Our own identities become lost and are vulnerable in our modern, violent worlds.</p>
<p><strong>We identify and recognize this figure</strong> even though we see SO little of it. Destruction leaves us as shells of who we once were.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>androgynous figure</strong> focuses on humanity, rather than gender. Notice  the body language. The shoulders are pulled forward, with a slumping back.</p>
<p>The figure in deep despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>wrinkled skin</li>
<li>backbone</li>
<li>musculature</li>
<li>veins</li>
<li>missing limbs and head</li>
</ul>
<p>It is elevated from the floor by a wood structure as a base. Does this fill in for the legs?  Is this a wheelchair? Gurney?</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>was considered <strong>a pioneer of fiber-based sculpture. </strong>Her art was affected by her experiences in Poland, under Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II.</p>
<p>Born in 1930, she lived on a large estate in Poland. Here she often played in the woods. She said this later inspired her to use natural materials in her works.</p>
<p>In WWII, German tanks entered her family’s estate. Later a drunk German soldier burst into the house and shot off her mother’s arm in front of her. In 1944, the family fled, as the Soviet army arrived and moved into Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>Abakanowicz</strong> worked as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded. This would later affect her art.</p>
<p>When the war was over, she attended art school at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Warsaw. Poland was a part of the Soviet Bloc. Social Realism was the style taught in art schools with smiling workers and images of a perfect society. She tried to avoid learning this style by choosing to work with textiles. Yet,  she had to adopt it to obtain a degree and enter the Polish Artist Union.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre, </em></strong><strong>from the series <em>The French Collection, Part I; #1</em>.,</strong> is a work by artist <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> that uses <strong>acrylic on canvas, with a tie-dyed, pieced fabric border</strong>. The artwork measures 6 feet 3 inches by 6 feet and 9 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> calls this work a <strong>story-quilt</strong>. She creates <strong>a central image using acrylic paint on canvas</strong>, then surrounds it with a patchwork cloth border that includes her <strong>handwritten text</strong>. In this way, she <strong>utilizes text and image together</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, she sandwiches a layer of batting underneath the canvas and on top of another piece of cloth. The figures are simple, flat, and stiff with a space that is shallow.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Through her art, she can rewrite the past through weaving together the history of African Americans and women. This is an alternative to the white masculine narratives that are prevalent in art history. This highlights the ways in which African-Americans and their experiences have been left out. Through most of history they have not been the subjects or the intended audiences of Western painting.</p>
<p><strong>Ringgold’s</strong> technique challenges the definition of painting and <strong>fine art</strong>. She has used acrylic on canvas but has mixed in the prominent <strong>folk art</strong>/craft tradition of quilting. Folk art is often defined in part by being produced by untrained artists.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This is the first in Ringgold’s series of twelve “story quilts” called <strong><em>The French Collection. </em></strong>The story tells the fictional narrative of Willa Marie Simone, a young black woman who moves to Paris in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Willa Marie’s adventures in Paris in the 1920s lead her to meet celebrities: Picasso, Matisse, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Josephine Baker.</p>
<p>The <strong>three paintings</strong> that the work shows as a backdrop at the Louvre are <strong>all by DaVinci</strong>: <em>Madonna and Child and St. Anne; Mona Lisa; Virgin of the Rocks</em>. Note all of the paintings are of woman and girls.</p>
<p>The girls dancing in front of the art become the show – instead of the historical white version on the walls!</p>
<h5><strong>Text on this image</strong></h5>
<p><em>Marcia and her three little girls took me dancing at the Louvre. I thought I was taking them to see the Mona Lisa, but you’ve never seen anything like this. Well, the French hadn’t either. Nevermind Leonardo da Vinci and Mona Lisa, Marcia and her three girls were the show</em>.</p>
<h5><strong>Art Expansion </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This work is an expansion of the art world and the art object. <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> is African American woman, and the art object is now a folk art/fine art hybrid. This reflects shifts into post-Modernism.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism</strong> rejects Modernism’s emphasis on universal meaning and abstraction.</p>
<h5><strong>Why the Story Quilts were Made </strong></h5>
<p>Ringgold’s story-quilting technique is important. <strong>Her mother was a fashion designer and seamstress</strong>. When her mother died in 1981, Ringgold started making these quilts.</p>
<p>Quilts have been associated with <strong>women’s domestic work</strong> and <strong>women’s connections with one another. </strong></p>
<p>Quilting is often done collectively. Young girls watch and participate to learn family stories, cultural backgrounds, and technical skills.</p>
<p>Quilts were of particular importance to the history of African Americans. On the Underground Railroad, codes and hidden messages were sewn onto quilts in safe houses that could help slaves find more secret routes and safe houses to the North.</p>

<p><strong><em>Electronic Superhighway</em></strong> by artist <strong>Nam June Paik</strong> is a <strong>mixed-media installation (49-channel closed-circuit video installation, neon, steel, and electric components)</strong> measuring 15 by 40 feet.</p>
<p>This huge, towering stack of TVs simultaneously shows multiple clips from a variety of sources. His studio was small, so he had to squish Texas and Florida . In total there are 336 TVs: 3,750 feet of cable and 575 feet of colored tubing.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist used video to show the speed of our increasingly <strong>electronic modern lives</strong>. It also celebrates an <strong>America influenced by film and television</strong>.</p>
<p>How have these things shaped who we think we are? How are we connected to each other via media? Is the effect of technology always a good thing? Can we have information overload?</p>
<p>This is <strong>a contrast between</strong> actual road trips, with a trip across the US in the gallery, with virtual travel on the Internet.</p>
<p>Notice the size and energy. All this plays into the American identity Paik was captivated by.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>An <strong>enormous scale</strong> suggests  the huge size of the nation. There is a map of the US with <strong>neon</strong> outlining the states. Neon reminded him of the signs for motels and restaurants that dot the highways. Different colors remind us that states have different identities.</p>
<p><strong>Images</strong> are flashing and rapidly changing. This is reminiscent of billboards being seen from passing cars.</p>
<p>Within each state, the screens display video clips that resonate with each state’s own identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kansas: <em>Wizard of Oz </em>(film)</li>
<li>Oklahoma: <em>Oklahoma </em>(film)</li>
<li>Iowa: footage of presidential candidates</li>
<li>Idaho: potatoes</li>
<li>Missouri: <em>Meet Me in St. Louis </em>(film)</li>
<li>Texas: cowgirls, cactus</li>
<li>New York: Empire State Building</li>
<li>Maine: clips of a friend</li>
<li>California: hallucinogens, Golden Gate Bridge, OJ Simpson</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p>Nam June Paik was born in Seoul, in 1932. He was considered <strong>the father of video art</strong>, with his first video art exhibit in 1963.</p>
<p>When Paik came to the US in 1964, the interstate highway system was only 9 years old. Highways offered everyone the freedom to see the USA. Highways were new and heavily advertised, as a way for Americans to see the country on a limited budget.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh</p>
<p><strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> a work by artist <strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> was created using <strong>ink and acrylic on canvas</strong> and measures <strong>9 by 12 feet. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Total abstraction</li>
<li>Black lines create centrifugal structure</li>
<li>Various shards of color float over the work’s black skeleton</li>
<li>Notice gray painterly marks that rise from the lower registers to the upper registers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visually, the work looks similar to Kandinsky! </strong>How does Mehretu do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Overlaps architectural plans, urban plans, diagrams, photos, graffiti, maps, abstract shapes, etc. on top of one another to create an illusion of depth and movement</li>
<li>Built up in layers and layers of drawing, and then many applications of paint</li>
<li>Mixture of drawing and painting</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>portrays chaos in the modern world. </strong>It invokes our experiences of being in busy, in collective spaces. It captures the speed, energy, and chaos of a globalized, hectic world.</p>
<p>What are the results of our interconnectedness, our globalization?</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumerism (corporate logos)</li>
<li>National identities and propaganda</li>
<li>Religious symbols</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference to Kandinsky is important. Remember, Kandinsky and Mondrian believed pure abstraction could bring us together. Mehretu’s work is abstraction speaking about universalism and collectivity!</p>
<p>Title of the work, <strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> refers to arenas and stadiums</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Places where national identities, power, commerce, entertainment, sport, and conflict merge.</li>
<li>Should remind us of the circular spaces of a sports arena or amphitheater.</li>
<li>Imagine the energy of spectators, the matching colors, signs, and banners held overhead,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Visualization of the energy, sound, enthusiasm of a group of people</li>
<li>Colors allude to the French, Russian, American, Chinese, and Japanese flags, as well as there being crosses and corporate logos</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> is Ethiopian born and works in NYC with her partner who is also an artist.</p>
<p>Stadiums in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century are increasingly important spaces.  They are places for Olympics, nationalist fervor, other sports, religious gatherings, political rallies, and concerts.</p>
<p>In today’s world they are also places for <strong>terrorist attacks</strong> that focus on large numbers of people.</p>

<h5>TOPIC 9.3 <strong>Theories and Interpretations of Pacific Art</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>arts of the Pacific</strong> are expressions of beliefs, social relations, essential truths, and compendia of information held by designated members of society.</p>
<p>The acts of creation, performance, and even destruction of a mask, costume, or installation often carry the meaning of the work of art, instead of the object itself carrying the meaning.</p>
<p>Meaning is communicated at the time of the work’s appearance, as well as in the future when the work, or the context of its appearance, is recalled. This sort of memory is evoked through the presentation of primordial forms such as cultural heroes, founding ancestors, or totemic animals to reaffirm shared values and important truths. In some instances, the memory is created and performed, and then the objects that appeared in those processes are destroyed, leaving a new iteration of the memory.</p>

<p><strong>Nan Madol a city </strong>created<strong> in Pohnpei, Micronesia </strong>is constructed from<strong> basalt boulders and prismatic columns.  </strong>There are<strong> 92 islets or small islands</strong> that are man-made. It is constructed in a lagoon, where the sea floor is not very deep.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Madol</strong> was created by placing large rocks atop submerged coral reefs to build up raised platforms. These could support large basalt prismatic columns or naturally rod-like and straight pieces of basalt.</p>
<p>No mortar was used. In <strong>ashlar masonry</strong> all the stones are cut to be the same shape, size, and surface texture.  <strong>Basalt </strong>was brought in from another area as it is not found here</p>
<p>Some of the structures are 60 feet tall. This raised the question of how they would have erected these structures as the <strong>people did not have knowledge of pulleys, levers, or metal.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This was the political seat of the Saudeleur Dynasty. Chiefs required potential rivals and aristocrats to live in the city rather than in their home districts. Here their political activities would be easier to monitor. This is similar to Cusco and Versailles.</p>
<p>As for social status, the size of residences indicated the wealth of the elite. It was a display of power and piety.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This was the first organized government in the region between 1100 – 1628.  It was a deeply religious community focused on worship of the sea. It was believed that sea dragons built Nan Madol.</p>
<p>The population on the island did not exceed 1,000 and often it was half of that.  The total kingdom population was 30,000. This means the building effort was greater for this community than building the pyramids was for the Egyptians.</p>
<p>The site was abandoned in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.  Little is known about the group.</p>

<p><strong>Moai on platform (<em>ahu</em></strong>) located on<strong> Rapa Nui (Easter Island) </strong>dates to between<strong> 1100-1600 CE. </strong>The word<strong> moai </strong>means statue. <strong> </strong>On average the figures stand<strong> 13 feet tall </strong>and are<strong> made from tuff on a basalt base.  Tuff </strong>is rock made from volcanic ash. <strong>Basalt</strong> is a hard, dark volcanic stone quarried from the large hills on the island.</p>
<p>There are<strong> 887 statues</strong> in all, mostly male and each <strong>weighing 50 tons.</strong> These are erected on large platforms (<strong>ahu</strong>). The eye sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral. The works were once painted with red and white.  Each statue has a heavy eyebrow ridge, elongated ears, oval nostrils, emphasized clavicle, thin arms, no hands, large forehead, and a long nose.</p>
<p>The stones were quarried from mountains up above and then slid along the side of the mountain, until they landed upright in a hole. The trick was getting them to not tip forward once they were in the hole.</p>
<h5><strong>How were these Transported?</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>first theory</strong> is they were moved horizontally on a sled.</p>
<p>The <strong>second theory</strong> is that they were rolled horizontally using logs.</p>
<p>If you ask islanders, they say the statues “walked”. This was largely disregarded by historians as being mystical or metaphorical.</p>
<p>A Czech historian even tried dragging the statue along in an upright position. This damaged the statue and in effect, it ground down the bottom, like rubbing it with sandpaper. Instead, they realized you need three ropes tied to each one.</p>
<p><strong>Two ropes are needed on the sides and one behind</strong>. The two side ropes rock the statue from side to side, slightly pulling forward so it will see-saw along. The rope on the back helps to stabilize it, so it won’t collapse forward or back.</p>
<p>The ropes are tied where the eyes are through the deeply inset nose bridge and eye sockets. This way it can move 100 yards in 40 minutes this way and it is easier to go uphill.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Moai were carved to commemorate important ancestors. This was a display of status for both the ancestor and the patron/relative who commissioned it. The statue embodies the spirit of the past. All moai face with their backs to the sea. In this way, they are guardians, that protect and focus on the island.</p>
<p>Almost all were toppled. This was done out of frustration by locals when the statues were viewed as not protecting the island. Most have been restored to their original spots.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Statues represent ancestors deified after death</li>
<li>Topknots on some statues likely represent chieftains</li>
<li>The larger the statue, the more powerful the individual was</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Discovery</strong></h5>
<p>Easter Island (native name = Rapa Nui) is called that because it was discovered on Easter 1722 by the Dutch.  The island is just 10 miles long and 6 miles wide. It is one of the most isolated places on earth and extremely remote.</p>
<h5><strong>Art Comparisons</strong></h5>
<p>This monumental sculpture is unique in Pacific art and more like South America. Some theorized Rapa Nui wasn’t Oceanic at all, but rather Latin American. This has been disproved with genetic testing.</p>
<h5><strong>How did the Island Collapse?</strong></h5>
<p>The old theory is the island depleted its resources and completely deforested itself, causing a decline in birds and therefore a decline in food. The people toppled the moai, upset with the ancestors for not protecting the island (theory of Jared Diamond who wrote <em>Guns, Germs, Steel</em>).</p>
<p>But there is a new theory. On the first sighting in 1722, the Dutch described the island as bountiful and thriving. In 1774, Captain James Cook described the island as having human bones everywhere and being sparsely populated. The island was exposed to European diseases for which Easter Islanders had no natural immunities.</p>

<p><strong>Malagan mask </strong>from<strong> New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea </strong>is a creation made from<strong> wood, pigment, fiber, and shell. </strong></p>
<p>The face is highly stylized. These funerary masks often have pierced ear lobes and a prominent mouth, commonly opened. Masks also have an asymmetrical hair design. The left side is bare to show how a New Ireland man would shave his head in mourning.</p>
<h5><strong>Ownership</strong></h5>
<p>Ownership of a Malagan object is like the modern notion of copyright. When a piece is bought, the seller surrenders the right to use that style, form and even the rights.</p>
<h5><strong>The Creators</strong></h5>
<p>Mask making does not involve women. Only male artists are hired for their carving skills.</p>

<p>Malagan ceremonies and feasts are primarily concerned with honoring and releasing the dead. It also acts as an affirmation of identity of clan groups.</p>
<p><strong>Malagan masks</strong> were <strong>worn by men during a performance</strong> to help release the dead and assist their souls to reach the spirit world. Each mask honors a specific individual and illustrates their relationship with ancestors, clans, or living family members.</p>
<p>These are not a direct portrait but a representation of the life force.   The mask draws the soul of the dead towards the ceremony.</p>
<p>Masks could be reused by families because they were so expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Malagan sculptures</strong> were made for the single occasion of Malagan ceremonies and then destroyed. At the height of the ceremony, the <strong>Malagan sculptures were exhibited in temporary display houses</strong>. This was said to help the souls of the dead find their spiritual likeness and embed themselves in the sculptures.</p>
<p>The sculptures were treated with the utmost care, since it was believed that the souls of the deceased entered the sculptures. To forcefully dismiss the dead, the sculptures were burned.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Masks can represent ancestors, <strong>ges</strong> (spirit double of an individual), or various spirits associated with the area, and often include clan symbols.</li>
<li>Include representations of fish and birds of identifiable species, alluding both to specific myths and the animal’s natural characteristics.</li>
<li>Sculptures represent the <strong>ges</strong> – specific to the individual.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Malagan ceremonies became extremely expensive affairs, considering the costs of the accompanying feasting. Funeral rites could take place months after a person had died. They might even be held for several people simultaneously. The families paid in pigs and shell money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>THE PACIFIC</h2>
<h3><strong>700- 1980 CE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1712" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/223.jpg?resize=990%2C710&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="710" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/223.jpg?w=492&amp;ssl=1 492w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/223.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 9.2 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Pacific Art</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pacific region</strong>—including more than <strong>25,000 islands</strong>, about 1,500 of which are inhabited—is defined by its location within the Pacific Ocean, which comprises one third of the earth’s surface. The lands are <strong>continental</strong>, <strong>volcanic</strong>, and <strong>atollian</strong>. Each supports distinct ecologies that exist in relation to the migrations and sociocultural systems that were transported across the region.</p>
<h5><strong>Patterns of Migration</strong></h5>
<p>Geological and archaeological evidence indicates that Papuan-speaking peoples traveled across a land bridge that connected Asia and present-day Australia about 30,000 years ago. Lapita people migrated eastward across the region beginning 4,000 years ago. Populations sailed from Vanuatu eastward, and carried plants, animals, and pottery. This now demonstrates a pattern of migration and connection from what was the Lapita culture.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting Sail on the Pacific Ocean</strong></h5>
<p>Ships and devices of navigation and sailing expertise were built and used to promote <strong>exploration, migration,</strong> and the <strong>exchange of objects</strong> and cultural patterns across the Pacific. Navigators created personal charts of their experience of the sea. Other objects were intended to protect and ensure the success of sailing. Ocean-going vessels carried families, and often communities, across vast distances. Passengers could also return to their place of departure.</p>
<p>The sea is ubiquitous as a theme of Pacific art. As a presence in the daily lives of a large portion of Oceania, art both connects and separates the lands and peoples of the Pacific.</p>
<h5><strong>Variations in Art</strong></h5>
<p>The arts of the Pacific vary by virtue of ecological situations, social structure, and impact of external influences, such as commerce, colonialism, and missionary activity.</p>
<h5><strong>European Arrival</strong></h5>
<p>The region was explored by Europeans as early as the 16th century and most extensively from the second half of the 18th century. By the beginning of the 19th century, Dumont d’Urville had divided the region into three units: micro- (small), poly- (many), and mela- (black) nesia (island).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micronesia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Polynesia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Melanesia</strong></li>

<h5><strong>A Force of Power</strong></h5>
<p>Arts of the Pacific involve the power and forces of <strong>deities, ancestors, founders</strong>, and <strong>hereditary leaders</strong>, as well as <strong>symbols of primal principles</strong>. These are protected by wrapping, sheathing, and other forms of covering to prevent human access.  Ritual dress, forms of armor, and tattoos encase and shield the focus of power from human interaction.</p>
<p>One’s vital force, identity, or strength <strong>(mana)</strong> is expressed and protected by rules and prohibitions, as well as by wrapping or shielding practices, or <strong>tapu</strong>. Mana is also associated with communities and leaders who represent their peoples. Objects that project status and sustain structure hold and become mana. These objects are made secure through tapu or behaviors that limit access to and protect the objects.</p>
<h5><strong>Human History and Experience</strong></h5>
<p>Pacific arts are performed&#8211;<strong>danced, sung, recited, displayed</strong>&#8212; in an array of colors, scents, textures, and movements. This aids to enact narratives and proclaim primordial truths. Belief in the use of <strong>costumes, cosmetics</strong>, and <strong>constructions</strong> assembled to enact epics of human history and experience. This is central to the creation of and participation in Pacific arts.</p>
<p>Objects such as <strong>shields, ancestral representations</strong>, and <strong>family treasures</strong> were and continue to be constructed to give form to and preserve human history and social continuity. Other art forms are constructed to be displayed and performed to remind people of their heritage and shared bonds, such as the significance of an ancestor or leader. These are intended to be destroyed once the memory is created.</p>
<p>Rulers of the Saudeleur Dynasty commanded <strong>construction</strong> of Nan Madol in Micronesia, a residential and ceremonial complex of numerous human-made islets. Rulers of Hawaii were clothed in <strong>feather capes</strong> that announce their status and shield them from contact. Societies of Polynesia in New Zealand, Rapa Nui, and Samoa create <strong>sacred ceremonial spaces</strong> that both announce and contain their legitimacy, power, and life force. In Melanesia, individuals and clans earn status and power and sustain social balance in a set of relationships marked by the <strong>exchange of objects</strong>. Masks, and the performance of <strong>masks</strong>, are a recital and commemoration of ancestors’ histories and wisdom.</p>
<h5><strong>Art as Commerce</strong></h5>
<p>A barter system in art exists in communities, in which one set of objects is exchange for something equally as valuable. The process of exchange is complex and prescribed. Chants, dances, scents, costumes, and people of a particular lineage and social position are called into play to create a performance. This verifies the significance exchange.</p>

<p>The <strong>Staff god</strong> is a figure measuring <strong>12 feet high</strong> and is made of <strong>wood, tapa, fiber, feathers</strong>. It was found on Rarotonga, Cook Islands, in central Polynesia. It is the only surviving wrapped staff god.</p>
<p>The <strong>Staff god</strong> is comprised of three parts. The stylized and carved wooden head has feathers attached to ears. The rod continues but is now wrapped in tapa cloth/barkcloth. <strong>Tapa</strong> cloth is made from bark, soaked, beaten, dried, decorated. The carved wooden phallus is now missing.</p>

<p>Little is known about the exact use or function of the <strong>Staff god</strong>. It was worshipped by Cook Islanders and probably one of their most sacred objects. It likely had to do with reproduction, fertility, abundance, and harvest.</p>
<p>The ceremonies likely had an explicit sexual component to them. It is thought that the phallus was involved in stabbing the ground to ensure a way of fertilizing the land and reaping the harvest.</p>
<p>Men carved the wooden object, while women made the cloth for it.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The<strong> Staff god </strong>might represent Tangaroa, the creator god. The work Illustrates the stylized head of a god and then small spirits lining his stylized body.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Cook Islands</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cook Islands</strong> are in the middle of the South Pacific and were settled around 800-1000 CE. In 1773 English Captain Cook made the first sighting but spent little time here. In the 1800s the English set up missions on the islands. The islands were Christianized. The arrival of Europeans meant destruction of native practices.</p>

<p><strong>Buk (mask), </strong>from the<strong> Torres Strait </strong>is made from<strong> turtle shell, wood, fibers, feathers, and shell. </strong>It stands<strong> 21 inches tall. </strong>The features are from a frigate bird and raffia is used. The pieces were stitched together.</p>
<p><strong>Why was Buk (mask) made? </strong></p>
<p>This was <strong>part of a costume</strong> for a masquerade ceremony, which included grass skirts and tops. The ceremony involved fire, drumbeats, and chanting. Only senior men could wear these masks and they were worn like a helmet</p>
<p>The ceremonies were used to invoke heroic ancestors and to contact them. The <strong>Buk</strong> (mask) is a <strong>Totem,</strong> an object that connects to spirits or ancestors. The dances were re-enactments of the events of the lives of ancestral heroes.</p>
<p>Ancestors were contacted to ask for their support with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fertility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Male initiations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funerary rituals</strong></li>
<li><strong>A good harvest</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The mask is <strong>divided into two registers</strong>. There is a <strong>human face</strong> and above it the face and body of <strong>a bird</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who is represented?</strong></p>
<p>Is this the face of a hero? Could it be an ancestor ? A heroic ancestor? The frigate bird was probably this ancestor’s spirit animal.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Geography and History </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Torres Strait</strong> is a body of water between New Guinea and Australia. Most of the islands in this region are uninhabited.</p>
<p>In 1606, Spanish explorer Tovar records the use of turtle-shells in artwork on Torres Strait.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, turtle shells were actively traded by Europeans. Therefore, there was a decline in availability of turtles for native artwork.</p>
<p>In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century Europeans colonized and Christianized, leading Torres Strait Islanders to burn and destroy masks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tamati Waka Nene</em></strong> was dead for two years before <strong>Gottfried Lindauer</strong> was commissioned to paint this <strong>oil on canvas</strong> portrait measuring <strong>40 by 32 inches</strong>. The artist worked from black and white photographs, taken by John Crombie, who had been commissioned to produce 12 photo portraits of Māori chiefs for the London Illustrated News.</p>
<p>Lindauer worked straight onto stretched canvas. Typically, artists will make sketches first. He outlined subjects in pencil, then applied translucent paints, and glazes</p>
<p>Lindauer had to use <strong>color theory</strong> to help create the right tones and shades. The painting is realistic, illusionistically 3-D, and utilizes light and shadow to cause the figure to glow against the dark background.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work records the likeness of Nene for Henry Partridge. He asked Lindauer to paint a set of portraits of well-known Māori chiefs to help preserve Māori traditions and to bring ancestral presence into the world of the living. These works were passed down in families and treated with great care and reverence.</p>
<h5><strong>About Tamati Waka Nene</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Tamati Waka Nene</strong> (1780-1871) was Chief of the Ngati Hao people, a tribe of the Māori or native peoples of New Zealand. Baptized in 1839, he picked the name Tamati Waka after the English patron of the Church Missionary Society, Thomas Walker.  The chief was regarded as a man of great <strong>mana</strong> by his people.</p>
<p>Here he wears a fine cloak of kiwi feathers and earring of greenstone. He holds a hand weapon with feathers and a hand grip with an eye. Notice his <strong>Moko</strong> (facial tattoos) made using <strong>scarification.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>About the Māori</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Maori</strong> are the indigenous people of New Zealand.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Lindauer was a Czech artist who arrived in New Zealand in 1873. He studied at the Academy of Fine Art in Vienna. He worked as a portrait painter and traveled to New Zealand. There he met a businessman and entrepreneur named Henry Partridge. Partridge wanted Lindauer to paint portraits of well-known Maori.</p>

<p><strong>Navigation chart </strong>a<strong> wood and fiber </strong>work from<strong> Marshall Islands, Micronesia </strong>measures<strong> 26 by 38 inches. </strong>It is made from sticklike midribs of coconut palm fronds. Horizontal and vertical sticks act as framework.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work organized information about piloting and navigating islands, currents, and swells. The charts were used as memory aides for experienced navigators. The significance of each was known only to its maker. It was made for trainings before voyages. The information was memorized. To carry one at sea would put a navigator’s skill in question.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>

Most charts cover smaller areas.</span></p>
<p>This example <strong>represents the two chains of islands</strong> which form the Marshall Islands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagonal and curved sticks represent wave swells</li>
<li>Shells represent position of islands</li>
<li>Not constructed to scale</li>
</ul>
<p>The charts indicate <strong>the positions of islands</strong>, but they primarily record features of the sea</p>
<ul>
<li>Marshallese navigation was based largely on the detection and interpretation of the patterns of ocean swells.</li>
<li>Much as a stone thrown into a pond produces ripples, islands alter the orientation of the waves that strike them, creating characteristic swell patterns that can be detected and used to guide a vessel to land.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Navigation was an essential skill or sailors would be lost. In the past, knowledge of the art of navigation was a closely guarded secret handed down within certain chiefly families. Ultimately, more and more charts were made to help increase knowledge.</p>
<p>This chart consists of 34 coral atolls spread out across several hundred miles. They are low-lying and hard to see from a distance, as are many of the islands in this region</p>
<p>To maintain connection between the islands, Marshall Islanders built seafaring canoes. This was necessary for trade and community building.</p>

<p><strong><em>Presentation of Fijian mats and tapa cloths to Queen Elizabeth II</em></strong> is a photographic documentation of the Queen’s visit to Fiji in 1953. The presentation to her Royal Highness involved a <strong>multimedia performance (costume; cosmetics, including scent; chant; movement; and pandanus fiber/hibiscus fiber mats).</strong></p>
<p>Barkcloth, or <strong>masi</strong>, is made by stripping the <strong>inner bark of mulberry trees</strong>. The bark is then soaked. Then it is beat it into strips of cloth. These are <strong>glued</strong> together, often by a <strong>paste made of arrowroot</strong>. Bold and intricate geometric patterns in red, white, and black are often painted.</p>
<p><strong>Fijian mats</strong> were made by women. This involved stripping, boiling, drying, blackening, and then softening <strong>leaves from the Pandanus plant</strong>. Dried leaves were then woven into tight, diagonal patterns that have frayed or fringed edges.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Traditionally, cloth and mats are presented as gifts, in important ceremonies such as weddings and funerals. In this case, it was to commemorate a visit by the Queen of England.</p>
<p>This is a display of the power the British have over their colonies/ex-colonies/and parts of the commonwealth. It encourages subjects to still be culturally, ideologically, and politically connected to the British Empire</p>
<h5><strong>In the Photograph</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The photo shows a procession of Fijian women making their way through a group of seated Fijian men and women. The women in the performance are wearing skirts made from barkcloth that are painted with geometric patterns. They are carrying rolls of woven mats.</p>
<p>This displays the power of the community and the respect towards traditional ceremonies. The mats/tapas are simple. Simplicity is an indication of their importance. The simpler the design, the more meaningful its function.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Fiji </strong></h5>
<p>Fiji is a group of islands located in the South Pacific Ocean. Fiji is north of New Zealand&#8217;s North Island and east of Australia.</p>
<p>Fiji was part of the <strong>British Commonwealth</strong> (collection of states that used to be part of the British Empire today referred to as the <strong>Commonwealth</strong>).  Post WWII, many colonies were actively looking for independence, some more violently than others.</p>
<h5><strong>The Commonwealth Tour</strong></h5>
<p>The Commonwealth tour by Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh was to encourage states to stay a part of the Commonwealth.  On December 17, 1953, they arrived on the island of Fiji, then an English colony, and stayed for three days before continuing their first tour of the commonwealth nations of England in the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>They visited hospitals and schools and held meetings with various Fijian politicians.</p>
<p>They witnessed elaborate performances of traditional Fijian dances and songs and even participated in a <strong>kava</strong> ceremony. Kava is a drink made from the ground roots of kava plant and is sipped by members of the community, in order of importance.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 9.1 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in Pacific Art</strong></h5>
<p>Understanding the intended purpose and audience of the arts of the Pacific is an important focus of study in this unit. Works of art from this region are <strong>often performed</strong>, and the experience is central to the creation of and participation in them.</p>
<h5><strong>Social Life and Culture</strong></h5>
<p>The arts of the Pacific are <strong>expressions of beliefs and social structure</strong>, which are strong forces in the social and cultural life of this region. Art and art making in this region is influenced by many things, and <strong>physical setting and available materials</strong> can be important considerations that affect artistic decisions and creations. Pacific arts are often distinguished by materials including <strong>sea ivory</strong>, seashell, tortoise shell<strong>, wood, coral, stone</strong>, <strong>fiber, pigment,</strong> and <strong>bone. </strong></p>
<p>These objects are <strong>carried, exchanged, and used</strong> by peoples of the region.</p>
<h5><strong>Creating a Response</strong></h5>
<p>Objects and behaviors in the cultures of the Pacific are often designed and presented to stimulate a particular response. Rare and precious materials are used to <strong>demonstrate wealth</strong>, <strong>status, and particular circumstance</strong>. <strong>Ritual </strong>settings are structured to address all the senses. Physical <strong>combat and warfare</strong> are announced and preceded by displays of ferocity in dress, dance, verbal aggression, and gestural <strong>threats</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>(9) 215. <em>‘Ahu ‘ula (feather cape)</em>. </strong></h4>
<p>Oceanic (Hawaiian). Late 18<sup>th</sup> century<strong>.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_1713" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1713" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1713" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/215.jpg?resize=800%2C588&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="588" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/215.jpg?w=313&amp;ssl=1 313w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/215.jpg?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1713" class="wp-caption-text">‘Ahu ‘ula<br />© The Trustees of the British Museum/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><em>‘Ahu ‘ula (feather cape)</em></strong><strong> is constructed with feathers and fiber and measures  26 by 17 inches. </strong>The capes were made by men and was  considered a sacred activity.</p>
<p>It consisted of olona fiber netting made in straight rows, with pieces joined and cut to make the desired shape. Tiny bundles of feathers were attached to the netting in overlapping rows starting at the bottom edge. The fiber base to which the feathers are attached was considered sacred. The knotted cords were associated with the wearer’s lineage which could be traced back to the gods.</p>
<p>These capes often have 500,000 feathers. Some of the feathers used came from birds that only had seven usable feathers on their bodies.</p>
<p>Other groups in Oceania make feather capes but the Hawaiian <strong><em>‘Ahu ‘ula</em></strong> is unique in its crescent shape and arced feather designs.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The Hawaiian male nobility (<strong>ali’i</strong>) or Hawaii’s ruling elite, wore feather cloaks and capes for ceremonies and battles. This was a sign of status, gender, bravery, and honor. Cloaks were used for physical and spiritual protection (<strong>mana</strong>) in battles. <strong>Mana </strong>is a supernatural power associated with people of high rank. By appearing in the guise of gods, Hawaiian chiefs would have sought to intimidate their enemies.</p>
<p>As feathers needed to make the capes became scarce, and members of the ali’i began requiring feathers as tribute. The length and complexity of the capes conveyed not only the <strong>mana</strong> of the wearer, but also a sense of how many people and territories the wearer controlled.</p>
<p>These capes showed a clear visual relationship between themselves and the gods. Red was a divine color.  The bodies of Hawaiian gods were thought to be covered with bird feathers, so when an ali’i wore a feather cloak, his body was enveloped in feathers just like the body of a god.</p>
<p>This reflects the lineage of the wearer since they were made for individuals. Patterns includes symbols relating to a clan and have been described as heraldic. When capes were being produced, artists recited the  genealogy of the wearer during the construction of the cape. Weaving the story of the family and the individual into the garment increased the mana in the cape.</p>
<h5><strong>The Meaning</strong></h5>
<p><strong> ‘Ahu ‘ula</strong>  means red garment and is used to refer to feather capes. The length of the cape reflected the status of owner. A person of a lower status owned this one. This is a small cape and would wear more like jacket length.</p>
<h5><strong>Color</strong></h5>
<p>Red was associated with both gods and chiefs. It was the color of divinity and only worn by royalty. Yellow was the sign of wealth because yellow feathers were rare, due to their scarcity.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Birds </strong></h5>
<p>The red feathers came from the ‘i’iwi bird and the apapane bird. Yellow feathers came from the ‘o’o bird.</p>
<p>Most birds naturally lose and replace their feathers regularly throughout their lives. Since feathers are naturally recurring, like human hair, they usually grow back after being pulled out.</p>
<p>It was believed that when in flight, the proximity of birds to the sky meant they could fly between this world and the spirit world, where gods and ancestors reside.</p>
<h5><strong>More About the Capes</strong></h5>
<p>These capes were worn by men and made for specific individuals. They were not passed down through a line of succession. The wearer did not select or commission the pattern.</p>
<p>Chiefs would appear in feather capes and similarly feathered helmets at ceremonies and battle. Every time the feather cape was worn, it acquired more <strong>mana. </strong>If a chief conquered another chief, the victor could incorporate the design of the fallen chief’s feather cape into his own, thereby appropriating the fallen chief’s mana. Additionally, it was considered a commemoration to use previous ruler’s feathers.</p>
<p>Large numbers of feather cloaks and capes were given as gifts to European sea captains and their crews&#8211; who were the earliest visitors to Hawaii—but they were not created for the purpose of gift giving. Often, these were then regifted from sailors to the patrons, who financed their voyages.</p>
<p>It is unknown who brought this particular cape to England.</p>

<p><strong>Hiapo (tapa cloth) </strong>is a<strong> tapa/bark cloth </strong>decorated with<strong> freehand painting.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>How bark cloth was made:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Women would harvest the inner bark of a paper mulberry tree.</li>
<li>The inner bark was pounded flat with a wooden beater, until damp and pulpy.</li>
<li>After hammering it into a thin layer, it was set out flat.</li>
<li>Then it was coated with the paste of the arrowroot and let it dry.</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Art and Gender Roles in Traditional Polynesian Societies</strong></h5>
<p>Gender roles were clearly defined in traditional Polynesian societies. The art men made had a masculine quality. It was <strong>made with hard material such as wood, stone, and bone</strong>. The art produced by <strong>women</strong> were often <strong>made of soft materials especially fibers</strong>.</p>
<p>Tapa cloth is often <strong>geometric</strong>. It has some components that are <strong>abstract</strong> and some that are <strong>representational</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilitarian: </strong>Used for clothing, bedding and wall hangings</li>
<li>Sign of status: often specially prepared for people of rank</li>
<li>Ceremonially displayed on special occasions</li>
<li>Used to wrap images of deities</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Hiapo</strong> (native name in Niue for tapa cloth)</li>
<li>Design illustrations include geometric motifs in an overall pattern: <strong>spirals, circles, squares, triangles as well as plants and leaves</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>1774: Captain James Cook reached the island</li>
<li>1830: London Missionary Society arrived to convert natives</li>
<li>Late 1800s: Niuan hiapo stopped being produced as Christianization caused the abandonment of traditional practices.</li>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 8.1 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia have long traditions of art making, reaching back into prehistoric times. The earliest known ceramic vessels were found in Asia. Fired shards from Yuchanyan Cave in China have been dated to 18,300 and 17,500 BCE.  Jomon vessels from Japan show shards dating back to 10,500 BCE. The arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia represent some of the world’s oldest, most diverse, and most sophisticated visual traditions.</p>
<h5><strong>Religion and Philosophy</strong></h5>
<p>Asian art was and is global. The cultures of these regions were connected to each other and to West Asia and Europe, with clear reciprocal influences. Here we will connect works of art and artistic traditions to the cultural practices and belief systems in South, East, and Southeast Asia. Many <strong>religious and philosophic traditions</strong> developed in these regions, and the art generated shows the strong influence.</p>
<h5><strong>A Wide Range of Media</strong></h5>
<p>The arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia include important forms developed in a wide range of media. <strong>Ceramic arts</strong> have flourished in Asia since the prehistoric era. Many technical and stylistic advancements such as the use of <strong>high-fire porcelain</strong>, developed here.</p>
<p><strong>Metal </strong>was used to create sculpture, arms and armor, ritual vessels, and decorative objects of all kinds.</p>
<p>Shang dynasty <strong>bronze vessels</strong> from China employed a unique <strong>piece-molding technique</strong> that has never been successfully replicated.</p>
<h5><strong>Distinctive Art Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Distinctive art forms from South, East, and Southeast Asia include the construction of <strong>Buddhist reliquary stupas</strong>. The practice of monochromatic ink painting on silk and paper, developed in China, as did the pagoda, an architectural form based on a Chinese watchtower. Also on this list are rock gardens, tea houses, and related ceremonies, as well as Japanese woodblock printing.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Stone and wood carving were prominent art forms used in architectural construction, decoration, and sculpture. Temples intended to house deities or shrines were constructed or rock-cut. Rock-cut caves containing Buddhist imagery, shrines, stupas, and monastic spaces span across Asia from India through Central Asia to China.</p>
<p>Japanese architecture often uses natural materials, such as wood, or follows Chinese architectural models with wood structures and tile roofs.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Painting in Asia usually took two forms—<strong>wall painting and manuscript</strong> or album painting. The painting styles that developed in India and East Asia favor contour drawing of forms over modeling.</p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Calligraphy</strong></h5>
<p>Calligraphy was an important art form in these regions. In China, calligraphy was considered the highest art form, even above painting.</p>
<p>Calligraphy was also prominent in Islamic art in Asia, and is found on architecture, decorative arts objects, and ceramic tiles, and in manuscripts written on paper, cloth, or vellum.</p>
<h5><strong>Textiles</strong></h5>
<p>Important textile forms from this region include <strong>silk</strong> and <strong>wool-tapestry weaving</strong>, <strong>cotton weaving</strong>, <strong>printing</strong>, <strong>painting</strong>, and <strong>carpet weaving</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Decorative Arts</strong></h5>
<p>Elegant and elaborate decorative programs featuring floral and animal designs are commonly found on decorative arts from East Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Museum</strong>: Gyeongiu National Museum in South Korea</p>
<p><strong>Gold and Jade Crown </strong>is a<strong> metalwork </strong>object<strong>, </strong>worn on the forehead, that<strong> measures 1 foot and 4 inches. </strong>The crown is lavish with ornamentation and elongated branch-like protrusions from which tiny <strong>gold discs</strong> and <strong>jade ornaments</strong> are attached.</p>
<p>The crown required very delicate and precise hammering as gold is a soft metal and jade is a hard material.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Work such as these were found in <strong>burials</strong> for royalty. Initially, historians believed this to be the sole purpose. Objects that were important in life were taken to the grave, but these crowns were also used in special and occasional <strong>ceremonial rites</strong> of the Silla royalty.</p>
<p>Silla used <strong>shamanistic practices</strong> in their ceremonies where Kings and Queens were significant players. The gold indicated the power of the wearer. A crown is also a visual marker of status.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols and Meanings</strong></h5>
<p>Three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke a sacred tree that once stood. It is believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi. </strong>Jade ornaments symbolized ripe fruit hanging from the tree branches as <strong>fertility and abundance. </strong>The antlers symbolized the power and speed of a deer. It is a sacred animal in Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries, Korea was divided into three kingdoms, with the <strong>Silla kingdom</strong> being the most powerful and wealthiest of all three. Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as <strong>a country of gold</strong>. Silla kings began to associate with gold and use it to identify royalty.</p>
<p>Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced <strong>shamanism</strong>. This is a type of nature worship which requires the expertise or mediation of a figure called a shaman who can facilitate communication between the gods and people. In shamanism Gods control nature. Humans are at the mercy of nature. The shaman intervenes on behalf of the people.</p>

<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> a set of two vases made from<strong> white porcelain with cobalt-blue underglaze </strong>each stand 2 feet tall<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a very specific kind of ceramic that is hard, white, brittle, and shiny. It gets the name from Marco Polo. Porcelain is close to the Italian name for a cowrie shell, and he thought it looked as shiny as a shell.</p>
<p><strong>Underglaze </strong>means the decoration is applied to the surface before it is glazed. This makes the decoration durable.</p>
<h5><strong>Parts of the Vase</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Lip</li>
<li>Neck</li>
<li>Handles on neck</li>
<li>Shoulder</li>
<li>Body</li>
<li>Foot</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> are one of the most famous cultural specimens of Chinese porcelain art. As part of the collection of Sir David Percival, they received the eponymous title! Sir Percival was known to possess a vast collection of Chinaware. He bought 1500 pieces of china during the Chinese Civil War, in the early 20th century, from Dowager Empress Cixi. She sold them to gain funds for the war.</p>
<p>The pair of artifacts <strong>exhibit a far eastern and middle eastern merger</strong> concerning the shape and the motifs they manifest. The viewer should deliberately focus on this aspect of <strong>cultural exchange</strong>. At the same time, they have an inscription on the neck, which stands out vividly. The inscription mentions the name and date of the artifact.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The two David Vases are <strong>identical with similar forms, colors, and materials</strong>. Made from porcelain, they are supposedly denoted to the deteriorated versions made in bronze, which was prevalent in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
<p>The identical vases possess the shape of an elongated vase with a handle on the neck above the shoulder. The form has a cylindrical base that tapers inwards to acquire a balanced grip on the ground. Above the same, two moldings create initial lower sections. The main body of the vase forms an arch near the shoulder, which concludes with molding. The elongated neck, a bit lesser than the length of the main body, joins to the thick rim, forming the head of the vase. The <strong>handles are shaped in the form of an elephant head and trunk on both sides.</strong></p>
<p>The artisans, maintaining the minimalistic approach, have used <strong>blue pigment on the white porcelain</strong>. The <strong>design </strong>of the vases is a <strong>blend of animals and decorative foliage</strong>. The lower cylindrical body is divided into equal sections comprising <strong>symbolic motifs.</strong> The following section displays <strong>floral motifs</strong> while the main body has a <strong>single dragon</strong> with an undulating body covering the entire circumference. Following the molding with a decorative pattern, the first section has the form of <strong>a flying phoenix amidst clouds.</strong> Divided by protruding partitions, the upper neck section has a pattern of successively repetitive vertical leaves. The head of the vase shows alternating floral motifs with foliage.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> do not have a special function to serve because they were for the altar of a Daoist temple. However, they have a vivid inscription at the cusp of the shoulder and the neck above the band of the dragon. The inscription mentions the name of the official who commissioned these elegant pair of blue and white Chinese wares.</p>
<p>Porcelain was used to create the initial vases. They were then painted with blue pigment. Artists deglazed at the end, thereby increasing the longevity of the pigments. This process is called underglaze. Hence, the vases are still intact and continue to gleam the space.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Although the material of porcelain indicates the Chinese traditions, the visual elements are borrowed from the Middle eastern regions of art. The middle east Mesopotamia zone was an artistic hub that created many copper-inlaid-with-gold vases. The designs, apart from arabesque, also had human figures and inscriptions, which served as a document to the history of the ware. Hence, these traditions seemed to have penetrated in Chinese workshops with the Mongol invasion. The kingdom of Mongols had expanded over nearly all of Asia.</p>
<p>China was the lead producer of porcelain, and hence the products were typically known as chinaware. And, as it appears, the blue and white porcelain products are quintessentially Chinese. Some of the kilns made by China could reach 2200 Fahrenheit.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>With an easy to read and distinct inscription, we know that these vases were commissioned by Zhang Wenjin of Yushan county in 1351. Along with <strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong>, he also presented an incense burner to a Daoist temple in Xingyua (modern-day Wuyan county). Yushan county is situated 120 km from Jingdezhen, where the vases were apparently made.</p>
<p>The inscription descriptively mentions the professional background of Wenjin who was in the salt trade. He made these vases as an offering to the temple to appease the god for his sins. At the same time, he also wanted to protect his family from evil.</p>
<p><strong>The inscription reads:</strong></p>
<p>信州路。玉山縣。順城鄉。德教里。荊塘社。奉聖弟子。張文進。喜捨。香炉。花瓶。一付。祈保。合家清吉。子女平安。至正十一年。四月。良辰。謹記。星源。祖殿。胡淨一元帥。打供。</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Zhang Wenjin, from Jingtang community, Dejiao village, Shuncheng township, Yushan county, Xinzhou circuit, a disciple of the Holy Gods, is pleased to offer a set comprising one incense burner and a pair of flower vases to General Hu Jingyi at the original palace in Xingyuan, as a prayer for the protection and blessing of the whole family and the peace of his sons and daughters. Carefully offered on an auspicious day in the 4th month, 11th year of the Zhizheng reign.”</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>During this period of the 14th century, Mongols had captured the entire stretch of the middle east to the far east. This stimulated an enormous amount of exchange in art, culture, and commerce between the Yuan dynasty of China and the Ilkhan empire of Iran. The blue pigment or cobalt in chinaware was imported from the Iranian Ilkhan empire. At the same time, the form of the vases also reflects a similarity with the bronze vases, which was a popular art activity in the middle east. The motifs and the pattern were also a middle east influence.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Museum:</strong> Goryeong Sin Family Collection in Korea</p>
<p><strong>Portrait of Sin Sukju</strong> from the <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> is a hanging scroll made from <strong>ink and color on silk. The work </strong>measures<strong> 5 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches.</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Korean portraiture conventions, court artists painted subjects in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-length view</li>
<li>¾ turn</li>
<li>Only one ear showing</li>
<li>With crisp angular lines</li>
<li>Little to no modeling; mostly using lines to show folds of fabric or skin</li>
<li>Highly controlled brushwork</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This hanging scroll was meant <strong>to be displayed</strong>. Silk is a sign of <strong>status.</strong></p>
<p>Sin Sukju (1417-1475) is depicted as a “meritorious subject” and celebrated as Prime Minister. He was an official honored for his distinguished service at court and his loyalty to the king. These types of portraits were common for government workers.</p>
<p>These portraits were cherished by families and worshipped for generations. This is similar to Head of Roman Patrician with a focus on ancestral rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju is dressed in his official robes, with a black silk hat on his head.  He is shown as a Neoconfucian scholar. He sits with his hands folded neatly and concealed within his sleeves. Excessive fabric is a sign of wealth (think of Arnolfini Portrait!).</p>
<p>He wears a rank badge on his chest that was typically made of embroidered silk. This indicates the status of the official which ranged from emperor to local official. Images of birds identified rank. Sin Sukju’s badge shows a pair of peacocks amongst flowers and clouds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju was Prime Minister from 1461 – 1464, and again through 1471 – 1475.</p>
<p>The <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> was trained to capture the likeness of sitters, while adhering to pictorial conventions for illustrating government members. Imperial Bureau was the government school of artists that standardized painted images. Since images were so standardized, artists likely specialized in one area such as the face, hands, or robe.</p>
<p><strong>Sinification</strong> refers to the diffusion of Chinese culture to other regions. Koreans adopted not only Confucianism but also traditions of Chinese paintings. This was a sign of cross-culturation.</p>

<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> by artist<strong> Ogata Korin </strong>was created using<strong> ink, watercolor, and gold leaf on paper. </strong>Each stand<strong> 5 feet tall by 5 feet and 6 inches wide</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1473" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/201-A.jpg?resize=318%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="318" height="287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/201-A.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/201-A.jpg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1474" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/210-B.jpg?resize=320%2C286&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="320" height="286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/210-B.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/210-B.jpg?resize=300%2C268&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Beauty of the Form </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two paired paper panels</li>
<li>Composition fills screen but is a simplified composition</li>
<li>Pared image down to the essentials to magnify important parts</li>
<li>Use of negative space (gold)</li>
<li>Abstraction/simplification and naturalism exist together</li>
<li>Background: subtle grid of gold leaf</li>
<li>Space tips upward</li>
<li>Patterned design of river shows movement</li>
<li>Serpentine contour of lake</li>
<li>Interplay of color, form, texture</li>
<li>New method: <strong>tarashikomi</strong> (tear-a-she-KO-me) blended different colors together while the bottom layer was still wet (this is the European method of wet-on-wet&#8211;just the Japanese version.)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> is a meditation on the transience of nature. It is the old versus new and a <strong>lesson of human existence</strong>. What was new will become old. Yet, there are merits to each part of life.</p>
<p>This work also contributes to an <strong>aesthetic pleasure</strong>. To decorate for one’s house in such an expensive way shows <strong>signs of status</strong>.</p>
<p>Folding screens were popular forms of art and interior décor.</p>
<h5><strong>The Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are <strong>two folding screens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the left </strong>the <strong>white plum tree</strong> grows off the paper. It is an older tree that bends downward. It flowers with a calm, mature, stable wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>On the right</strong> a <strong>red plum tree</strong> grows on the paper. It is younger, smaller, and grows upward. It has red buds that are bright, bold, energetic, and vibrant.</p>
<p>The <strong>stream</strong> at the center cuts through the pair of screens. It gives the sense of expanding form. The water looks to be moving because it is painted with swirls through <strong>tarashikomi.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Traditional Images of Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>It was common in Japan to use traditional images of nature to inspire meditation, contemplation, and a source of healing.</p>
<h5><strong>Rimpa Artists and Works</strong></h5>
<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, art historians termed artists like Korin “<strong>Rimpa</strong>” which literally means School of Korin.</p>
<p><strong>Rimpa work is characterized by</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction + naturalism</li>
<li>simplified compositions</li>
<li>sensuality in how the paint is applied with the <strong>tarashikomi </strong>method</li>
<li>Rimpa artists develop <strong>tarashikomi</strong> (wet on wet technique of applying and mixing paint; creates a swirly look)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rimpa artists were inspired by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>textiles (remember Korin’s family background)</li>
<li>ceramics</li>
<li>lacquerware which were all decorated in a traditional Japanese patterned manner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Favourite scenes included:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Passage of time</li>
<li>Seasons</li>
<li>Japanese literature (example: Tale of Genji – story of Heian Era extravagance)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ogata Korin (1658-1868) </strong>was the son of a merchant family who dealt in fabrics, and textiles for kimonos. Their clients included samurai and nobility. The family owned a lot of art by artists who used traditional Japanese flattening and decorative patterns. The artist was inspired by this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa </em></strong><strong>(Kanagawa oki nami ura),</strong> is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai. </strong>This is a<strong> polychrome woodblock print </strong>created with<strong> ink and color on paper. Part of the Series: <em>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em> </strong>it measures<strong> 10 by 14 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em>.</strong> Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled <em>Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji</em>.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a <strong>part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</strong></p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is a Japanese seascape <strong>Ukiyo-e print</strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The <strong>color palette</strong> is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong><strong> is a part of the series</strong>, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play<strong><em>, The Great Wave</em></strong> stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparent <strong>symbolism points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the Ukiyo-e print represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of <strong>a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang</strong>, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by <strong>Hokusai</strong>. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, <strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the ukiyo-e technique.</p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p><strong>Hokusai</strong> has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term <strong>Ukiyo-e means the floating world</strong>, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. Ukiyo-e prints were recognized by their <strong>emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</strong></p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>
<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the <strong>influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art</strong>. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><em><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> was created as one of the thirty-six prints <strong>by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.</strong> Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in <strong><em>The </em><em>Great Wave</em></strong>, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
