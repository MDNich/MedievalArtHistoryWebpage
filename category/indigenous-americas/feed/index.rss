<h4><strong>Indigenous Influence</strong></h4>
<p>Science uses the term <strong>mixture</strong> to describe when two things are blended. There are times in which you can see the different elements of a mixture—like in soil. There are also times in which you cannot, like when sugar is dissolved in water. It still looks like water, but when you taste it, the influence is there.</p>
<p><strong>Geography, economics, government, belief systems, external cultural influences, and technology</strong> are influences that historically impact a culture and subsequently <strong>impact the art and architec</strong>ture of that culture. <strong>European impact within the Indigenous Americas began in 1492</strong>, and you will explore the archeological and art historical impact of this influence.</p>
<p><strong>Art of the Indigenous Americas is classified chronologically and geographically</strong> into two designations: <strong>Native North America and Ancient America</strong>. European influence is like sugar dissolved in water; it has permeated the art of these regions but has not defined it.</p>
<p>The term <strong>indigenous</strong> is important because it signifies concentration on the cultures before European influence in 1492.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Native North America and Ancient America have roots in Asia, stemming from the prehistoric migration</strong>, but developed independently between 10,000 B.C.E and 1492 C.E. when European influence began.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient America classifies art created before 1550 C.E. south of the U.S.-Mexico border</strong>. The region is divided into three main areas of culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andean South America</li>
<li>Mesoamerica</li>
<li>Central America</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cultural influences</strong> in these regions include the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chavín</li>
<li>Olmec</li>
<li>Maya</li>
<li>Teotihuacan</li>
<li>Toltec</li>
<li>and Mexica (or Aztec).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Andean South America: The Chavín</strong></h5>
<p>The Andes Mountains of South America, which cross from Peru into Bolivia, saw the development of the Chavín and similar societies. These cultures practiced <strong>shamanism</strong>, a traditional belief system in which shamans achieve various powers through trance or ecstatic religious experience and can heal the sick and communicate with the otherworld and dead. As part of shamanism, they had a <strong>devotion to the animal and plant worlds</strong> as part of the practice of shamanistic religion and stressed survival and communion with challenging environments. <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong> was an important religious center. As a pilgrimage site and sacred space, people from the surrounding areas would travel to Chavín in search of religious experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Map of the Chavín culture.</strong></p>
<h5><strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> is at the site where two rivers join. Geographically is considered a tinkuay, or harmonious meeting of opposing forces, in shamanistic religion. This is significant, as travel would have been simplified for pilgrims.</p>
<p>The <strong>Old Temple</strong> is a flat-topped pyramid made of stone and u-shaped surrounding a round sunken plaza. The u-shape and sunken plaza indicate that this was an area for large gatherings for worship. Archeological evidence indicates that the building was added to over a series of hundreds of years, culminating in a larger temple and an additional rectangular-shaped sunken plaza. The Old Temple lacked windows and had a series of elaborate, maze-like tunnels that led to the <strong>Lanzón Stela</strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is representative of a central figure depicted as a feline head and human body that was worshiped.</p>
<p>Those who entered the temple to encounter the <strong>Lanzón Stela</strong> would need to rely on torches to light their way, which could enhance the possible religious visions. Relief sculptures with images similar to those on the Lanzón Stela are on the walls around the temple, further reinforcing the worship of the deity.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Comparison:  How does the Chavín de Huántar compare to other sacred architecture?</strong></h5>
<h5><strong><em>Chartres Cathedral</em></strong></h5>
<p>Also a pilgrimage destination, the <strong><em>Chartres Cathedral</em></strong> is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and is one of the oldest Christian shrines in France. It is the site where a piece of linen is kept that is believed to have been worn by the Virgin Mary when she gave birth to Jesus. This linen is believed to have healing powers and, therefore, is the focus of religious pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The <strong>European Gothic cathedral</strong> has a u-shaped cross (basic early Christian Basilica) floor plan and was constructed in several stages and is permeated with <strong>stained-glass windows</strong>. Large amounts of natural light to enter the chapel. This light was referred to as lux nova as it entered through what were considered sacred windows.</p>
<p>Featured on the west façade are a large, round stained-glass window and the <strong>Royal Portal</strong>. The Royal Portal features sculptures of biblical kings and queens on the columns. Above is Christ on a throne surrounded by four evangelists, an example of early Gothic sculpture.</p>

<h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
<p>Both <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong> and <strong><em>Chartres Cathedral</em></strong> have objects that worshipers see to encounter sacred experiences, and, therefore, they functioned as pilgrimage destinations. They were both constructed in several stages to accommodate their sacred function. While <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong> is impacted by the lack of windows and natural light, the <strong><em>Chartres Cathedral’s</em></strong> extensive stained-glass windows use an extraordinary amount of natural light to meet worship needs.</p>
<h5><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica and Central America</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica and Central America</strong> encompassed what are now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and western Honduras from 15,000 B.C.E. to 1521 C.E. and featured three major distinct cultures: the <strong>Olmec, Maya, and Mexica (or Aztec).</strong></p>
<p>These cultures succeeded each other as the previous declined, functioned with similar calendars, and built pyramidal stepped structures, sites, and buildings oriented in relation to sacred mountains and celestial phenomena. Green materials like jadeite and quetzal feathers were highly valued, as they were considered rare and symbolically associated with life and death.</p>
<p>These three cultures placed a large emphasis on <strong>blood sacrifice in their worship</strong> of a vast <strong>group of deities</strong>, and <strong>players of a ceremonial ball game would occasionally be sacrificed</strong>. They were hierarchical: a privileged, elite class dominated the political and religious landscape, building large ceremonial complexes as monuments to victory, the gods, and the dead.</p>
<p>Architectural styles between the Olmec, Maya, and Mexica cultures differed greatly. <strong>Olmec pyramids</strong> began as early earthworks. <strong>Mayan temples</strong> were nine-level structures with single temples, and the <strong>Mexica culture</strong> built similar structures with twin temples. The architecture transitioned to mainly stone post-and-lintel, often faced with relief sculpture and painted bright colors.</p>

<p>Plazas were typical for large ritual gatherings. Elaborate burials and other underground installations to honor the role of the underworld were also found. Sacred sites were renovated and enlarged repeatedly over the centuries, resulting in acropolis and massive temples.</p>
<h5><strong>The Olmec (1300 B.C.E.-200 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Olmec culture</strong> existed during the first millennium B.C.E., primarily in the <strong>Gulf Coast, Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras</strong>, and was the earliest Mesoamerican culture to build monumental sculpture. Four major Olmec centers contain the ruins of public ceremonial architecture and numerous stone monuments, with pyramids dominating the landscape. Several themes and motifs present in Olmec art and architecture are repeated throughout the history of Mesoamerica. The Olmecs valued <strong>greenstone</strong>, as green represented life and nature, producing some of Mesoamerica’s largest carvings in serpentine.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have reconstructed Olmec beliefs by comparing their art, architecture, and writing with later, similar cultures like the Mayans and Mexica. The <strong>earliest known religious practices were shamanistic</strong>. Shamans interacted with nature spirits like frogs, birds, and jaguars. Recurring motifs like the feathered serpent and rain deity were religiously important to the culture, and this importance is reflected within the art of the culture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2615" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?resize=893%2C509&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="893" height="509" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Map of the Olmec culture.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Altar of the Children</strong></h5>
<p>Most of the Olmec art we have relates to power and the supernatural world. A good example of a melding of these two themes can be seen in Olmec altar-thrones. These monolithic stone blocks have a flat top with a projecting edge. Originally considered altars, these blocks may have served as thrones. The front face of most altars follows a typical iconography.</p>
<p>A ruler, identifiable by headdress, is carved in high relief, sitting in a large niche. The niche is like a cave and symbolizes the underworld, the source of supernatural power. The power of such a ruler, therefore, comes from his association with the gods.</p>
<p>On Altar 5, this association deepens as we look at the child in the lap of the ruler. Although its face has been worn down, we can see a similar child carved on the side of the altar-throne in low relief.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2616" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=805%2C631&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="805" height="631" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=768%2C602&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Altar 5. Altar of the Children. </strong><strong>Olmec. La Venta, Mexico. 900–400 B.C.E.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Why so Mad?</strong></h5>
<p>Note that the child has an indented head and appears to be snarling. Archaeologists have postulated that this is a were-jaguar, or jaguar-baby. Such jaguar children are common motifs, unique to Olmec art, and a lot of speculation has ensued regarding their purpose.</p>
<p>One speculation is that they allude to a creation myth in which a woman mates with a jaguar, giving rise to a race of jaguar-people. Some statues depict adult jaguar-people, possibly shamans involved in transformation. Olmecs repeatedly used jaguars in art.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Jaguar Mask</strong></h5>
<p>Here’s another example of jaguar usage. This jaguar mask is a mosaic pavement made of serpentine. It was purposefully covered with clay and buried in several layers of dirt. Olmecs buried many works of art, possibly for spiritual reasons.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2619" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jaguar-mask.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-ca.-1000–600-B.C.E.-Mosaic-pavement..jpg?resize=807%2C606&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="807" height="606" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jaguar-mask.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-ca.-1000–600-B.C.E.-Mosaic-pavement..jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jaguar-mask.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-ca.-1000–600-B.C.E.-Mosaic-pavement..jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Jaguar mask</em>. Olmec. La Venta, Mexico. ca. 1000–600 B.C.E. Mosaic pavement.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Warrior</strong></h5>
<p>Not every work of Olmec art was otherworldly or spiritual. This colossal head, known by the nickname The Warrior, is one of many such sculptures. Carved from basalt, The Warrior portrays a powerful face with high cheekbones, hooded eyes, full lips, and a broad nose. He wears a close-fitting cap, and his fleshy earlobes are weighted with large round earspools–personal ornaments inserted in the stretched space of pierced earlobes.</p>
<p>Approximately 134 of these enormous sculptures have been found, ranging in height from 5 to 12 feet and weighing from 5 to more than 20 tons. Each face is naturalistic and individualized. We also have evidence of the deliberate defacement of some heads. This evidence indicates that the heads were probably portraits of specific rulers and a testament to their power.</p>

<h5><strong>The Maya (250 B.C.E.-1521 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Maya</strong> are still very much in existence. They emerged out of the Olmec decline around 250 B.C.E primarily in modern day <strong>Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala</strong>, and their descendants still thrive and maintain their traditions and beliefs.</p>
<p>The Maya <strong>used astronomy</strong> to chart the movements of Venus and the moon, create tables identifying their positions in the sky, and predict solar eclipses. Astronomy helped the Maya devise a complex calendar based on a solar year of 365 days, as with our modern calendar. It was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, plus an unlucky five-day period. There was a separate sacred year lasting 260 days, as well as other calendrical cycles.</p>
<p>The Maya are renowned for their <strong>technological and cultural accomplishments</strong>. They <strong>developed the most sophisticated hieroglyphic writing in Mesoamerica and perfected the calendar</strong> used throughout the region. Scholars of astronomy, mathematics, plants, and animals, they built great cities with pyramids, temples, necropolises, palaces, and government structures.</p>

<p><strong>Map of the Maya culture</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Temple of the Giant Jaguar</strong></h5>
<p>To the ancient Maya, <strong>pyramids were stairways to the heavens</strong>. They would have been expressions of power and displays of propaganda for residents and strangers alike.</p>
<p>The pyramids often enclosed tombs. A flat area at the top provided space for a temple. Access to the temple was by a long, steep staircase. The number of staircases reflects the number of entries to the temple.</p>
<p><strong><em>Temple I</em></strong> at Tikal is a 145-foot-tall pyramid that was the temple-mausoleum of Hasaw Chan K’awiil (r. 682-734 CE), the most important ruler of Tikal’s 7th CE resurgence who defeated Calakmul, Tikal&#8217;s greatest rival, in 695 CE and oversaw a significant rebuilding program in the city. The most impressive new buildings were the massive <strong>pyramids </strong>known simply as <strong><em>Temple I and II.</em></strong></p>
<p>The nine tiers of the pyramid probably refer to the nine levels of the Mayan Underworld.</p>
<p>The ornate structure that tops this example is a roof comb, which would have been brightly painted. The talud-tablero <strong>structure of the pyramids is evidence of the lasting influence of Teotihuacán architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>Another typical Maya feature is the sculpture of <strong>stone</strong> slabs to depict rulers and record their greatest accomplishments. Such <strong>stelae</strong> were set up in rows along the sides of the plazas. The oldest example of these stelae in Mesoamerica was discovered at Tikal and dates to 292 CE. It shows a ruler holding in his left hand the Jaguar God of the Underworld, probably a patron god of Tikal.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Overview</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Tikal </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Settlement at Tikal began from around 300 BCE</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> and, first clearing away areas in the jungle, monumental </span><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">architecture</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> was built in the period up to 100 CE. The city&#8217;s prosperity was based on exploitation of natural resources such as cedar wood, dye from Brazil wood, copal resin, flint, and cultivating maize in cleared areas of rainforest and fertile swamp areas.</span></p>
<p>In 378 CE Tikal was invaded by forces from distant <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> (or at the very least <strong>trade</strong> contacts were established) with a consequent influence on the cultural practices at Tikal, from clothes to art and architecture. From the late 4th century CE, Tikal was able to further expand its sphere of influence and <strong>conquer</strong> long-time local rivals. In the 6th century CE, the power of Teotihuacan declined, and other Maya cities, notably Caracol, sought military expansion, defeating Tikal in 562 CE.</p>
<p>However, by the 7th century CE Tikal regained its place as an important Maya city, contemporary with such centers as <strong>Palenque, Copan</strong>, and Tikal&#8217;s greatest rival Calakmul. Tikal consisted of nine different plazas and courts connected by causeways and ramps and has, in all, over 3,000 structures.</p>
<p><strong>Xibalba</strong> (Shee-bal-ba) was the name the K&#8217;iche <strong>Maya</strong> gave to the underworld, and it translates as &#8216;Place of Fright&#8217;, which indicates the terror the place had in the Maya imagination. Only those who died a violent<strong> death</strong> avoided Xibalba.</p>
<p>The underworld was a truly fearsome place, strongly associated with water. it had its own landscape, gods, and blood-thirsty predators. The Milky Way was also considered an entrance to Xibalba and the road along which souls walked to meet their fate.</p>
<p>The Maya, believing <strong>the underworld had nine different levels</strong>, represented this idea in the gigantic stone pyramids they built as tombs for their kings which often have nine tiers. See, for example, the <strong>Temple</strong> of the Inscriptions at Palenque, <strong><em>Temple I</em> at Tikal</strong>, or the <em><strong>Pyramid of Kukulcan</strong></em> at Chichen Itza.</p>
<p>The Maya also believed that each astronomical god had its own manifestation in the underworld. For example, the Sun God K&#8217;inich Ajaw, when he was travelling through the underworld at night, became the Jaguar God of the Underworld.</p>
<p>The <strong>most important Maya religious book, <em>the Popol Vuh</em></strong>, describes some details of the geography within Xibalba. To reach the ninth level of Xibalba, many trials and dangers had to be faced by the dead. These included the crossing of dangerous waters and high mountains, rivers of blood, attack by spinning obsidian knives and arrows, and even the sacrifice of one&#8217;s heart. To help the soul survive such an ordeal, the dead were buried or cremated with useful pieces of equipment such as weapons, tools, weaving kits, precious goods like jade, sustaining food such as hot chocolate, and even dogs (real or <strong>pottery</strong> effigies) to act as companions and guides.</p>

<h5><strong>El Castillo Pyramid</strong></h5>
<p>The most powerful of the Late Classic/Post-Classic Maya settlements is Chichén Itzá, which flourished for almost four hundred years.</p>
<p>The name means &#8220;opening of the wells of the Itzá.&#8221; The &#8220;wells&#8221; referred to the large cenotes, or sinkholes, at the site.</p>
<p>The Itzá themselves were Mayan–speaking people who arrived in the region around 800 C.E.</p>
<p>The most prominent structure in <strong>Chichén Itzá</strong> is the pyramid, <strong><em>El Castillo</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>Temple of Kukulcán</em></strong>. <strong><em>El Castillo</em></strong> is oriented to the four compass points, and each staircase has 91 steps. Including the platform  there are a total of 365 steps&#8211;the number of days in the year. Kukulcán was a deity approximately equivalent to Quetzalcóatl, the Feathered Serpent.</p>

<h5><strong><em>Pyramid of Kukulcán</em></strong></h5>
<p>The observatory at Chichén Itzá, with its snail-shaped dome and precisely oriented windows, was designed for astronomical observation.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> at Chichén Itzá has features quite different from that of Tikal (first image), reflecting its more cosmopolitan population. The pyramid is lower and wider in shape than those in other cities. Rooms are larger, and the use of pillars and columns appear for the first time. Although there is a ball court, its proportions are enormous and was more likely used for ritual purposes rather than for games.</p>

<h5><strong>Toltec Atlantids at Tula</strong></h5>
<p>One of the non-Maya influences on Chichén Itzá is that of the <strong>Toltecs</strong>, whose main city was at Tula. These atlantean columns—or atlantids—function much as caryatids did in ancient Greek architecture. Unfortunately, the roof no longer exists, but we can get a sense of the fierceness of these warrior people through their sculpture. These atlantids are spear-throwers, with drum headdresses and butterfly pectorals.</p>
<p>They were originally covered in bright, polychromatic paint. Each column is made of four stone drums attached with dowels, and this, coupled with the similarity in look, suggests mass production.</p>

<h5><strong>The Mexica (or Aztec) (1428-1521 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>After the Mayan culture, several cultures succeed each other, including the <strong>Teotihuacan and the Toltecs</strong>. The <strong>Mexica, or Aztec</strong>, Empire followed.</p>
<p>The <strong>history of the Mexica is documented in the <em>Codex Mendoza</em></strong><em>.</em> Antonio de Mendoza, the first Spanish viceroy of New Spain, commissioned native scribes and painters to produce the illustrated manuscript recounting the history of the Aztec (or Mexica) Empire. This manuscript echoes the style of Aztec manuscripts created before.</p>
<p>The Mexica (or Aztec) existed from 1428 to 1521 C.E. in the region of central Mexico. They began as a group of soldiers settling on a swampy island in Lake Texcoco. They called themselves the Mexica and claimed to be nomads from the mystical land of Aztlan in the north.</p>
<p>The Mexica would forge the Aztec Empire in the span of a century. Because of a 19th-century popularization of the name Aztec, they are referred to by the name of their empire. However, within their own culture, modern descendants still consider themselves Mexica.</p>
<p>The <strong>Aztec (Mexica) Empire</strong> consisted of the three city-states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenochtitlan</strong></li>
<li><strong>Texcoco</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tlacopan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tenochtitlan</strong> was the Mexica home city. According to legend, its location was chosen by the god Huitzilopochtli, who told the Mexica their wanderings would be over when they saw the mystical sign of an eagle resting on a prickly cactus and eating a snake.</p>
<p>The Mexica realized that vision at the site where they later built their home city. Originally on a swampy island, Tenochtitlan would be systematically expanded using <strong>chinampas</strong>, which were artificial islands built up as agricultural fields.</p>

<h5><strong>May the Gods Be with You</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Aztec (Mexica)</strong> religion had a complex combination of deities combined with ancient deities long worshiped in Mexico. The chief god worshiped was Huitzilopochtli (Hummingbird of the South), a war, sun, and fire deity. He was the son of Coatlicue (She of the Serpent Skirt) and sibling to the Centzon Huitznahua (Four Hundred Southerners) and Coyolxauhqui (She of the Golden Bells).</p>
<p>The Centzon Huitznahua and Coyolxauhqui were jealous when they discovered that Coatlicue was pregnant with Huitzilopochtli and murdered her. Then, at the moment of her death, she gave birth to Huitzilopochtli who then killed Coyolxauhqui and most of the Centzon Huitznahua. He then dismembered Coyolxauhqui and threw her body down Coatepec Mountain.</p>
<p>Other deities were assimilated from the cultures the Mexica conquered, along with the arts and methods of artmaking. This is evidenced in artworks like the <strong>Olmec-style mask</strong>. The natural features, square jaw, and materials used to make this mask are examples of Olmec influence.</p>

<p>The ritual cycle celebrated events in two calendars: a sacred calendar of 260 days and a solar calendar of 360 days (plus five unlucky days and nameless days). The two calendars overlapped once every 52 years, when a ritual called the New Fire Ceremony would take place.</p>
<p><strong>The Aztec (Mexica) Calendar Stone</strong>, a 25-ton stone, is often mistaken for a working calendar but it is a representation of the end of times. Aztecs (Mexicas) believed that the world had cycled through previous incarnations.</p>
<p>In the Aztec (Mexica) account, there had been four previous suns. The fifth sun, which represents our current age, would eventually disappear from the heavens, ushering in a new age.</p>
<p>The Mexica practiced bloodletting and human sacrifice to please Huitzilopochtli and sustain the great cycles of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Mesoamerican calendars</strong> had commonalities with European calendars, such as visions of the end of the world, both in the past (Noah&#8217;s Flood) and in the future (the Revelation of St. John). As in the Maya Long Count, Europeans started their calendars fixed on a single date: the birth of Christ. Aztecs (Mexicas), unlike the Maya, did not use a long count rooted in a past origin.</p>
<h5><strong>The Aztec (Mexica) Calendar Stone</strong></h5>
<p>Aztecs (Mexicas), like the Maya and other</p>
<p>Mesoamerican cultures before them, believed that the world had cycled through previous incarnations.</p>

<h5><strong>Center of Ring</strong></h5>
<p>At the center of the Calendar Stone is the outline of the glyph for Movement, one of the day signs, and the sign for the sun of this age. Four previous suns are shown within the outline. Each name day depicts how the age ended. Four-Wind, the glyph in the upper left, marked an age of the world destroyed by lethal winds. Four-Movement, then, would supposedly end in an earthquake. Perhaps that is why the central face on the Calendar Stone (sometimes mistaken for the sun god) is the face of the earth monster with her claws holding human hearts. This stone was likely placed on the ground to be a recipient of sacrifices.</p>

<h5><strong>Tenochtitlan</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>ruins of Tenochtitlan lie directly beneath the center of Mexico City</strong>, and at the center of Tenochtitlan was the <strong>sacred precinct with the <em>Templo Mayor</em></strong>. This pyramid-temple honored Huitzilopochtli. Two staircases went up the plaza levels to the top where two sanctuaries sat side by side. It contained seven shells, or layers, of walls nestled inside each other. Walls were built around the temple to enlarge it, resulting in superimposition.</p>
<p>At the base of the stairs was <strong><em>The Coyolxauhqui Stone</em></strong>. The stone has the image of Coyolxauhqui&#8217;s dismembered body, accented by carvings of skulls and bones underneath that could be the representations of the Centzon Huitznahua. When the Aztecs (Mexicas) sacrificed their conquered enemies at the top of the Great Temple, they would ritualistically reenact the actions of Huitzilopochtli when he threw Coyolxauhqui&#8217;s dismembered body down the stairs.</p>

<h5><strong>Sculpture and Sacred Space</strong></h5>
<p>Sculpture is a significant portion of Mexica art found in Tenochtitlan. The massive statue of Coatlicue, mother of Huitzilopochtli, contains symbolism of her death. A pair of serpent heads have come out of her neck where she has been decapitated, symbols of flowing blood. She wears a necklace of human hands, hearts, and skulls along with a skirt of snakes as evidence of the deity’s need for human sacrifice. The original setting of this statue is unknown, and it was found near Mexico City’s cathedral.</p>
<p>As evidenced by <strong><em>Templo Mayor</em></strong> and <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong>, varied manifestations of a sacred space reflect the cultural and religious context. The sacred space reflects the religious and functional needs of the people or culture. The use of religious space as pilgrimage and sacrificial sites changes based on the cultural and religious need. Each site was increased and superimposed based on the religious need, used to worship deities, and experience religious experiences.</p>
<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is classified chronologically and geographically into two designations: <strong>Native North America and Ancient America</strong>. Several cultures, including the <strong>Chavín, Olmec, Maya, and Mexica, comprise Ancient American art </strong>and include some of the oldest artistic traditions within colonization and migrant peoples, traditions that dominated the continent for the past 500 years. As part of worship in these cultures, artwork and architecture took on sacred functions to fulfill the needs in worship.</p>

<h4><strong>Cultural Misconception</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Bury Your Head in the Sand</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever heard that goldfish have a three-second memory? Or the idiom, “Don’t bury your head in the sand?” Both are common slang, or vernacular, and misconceptions.</p>
<p>Goldfish have a long-term memory of around three to six months. And “burying your head in the sand” is a reference to ostriches putting their heads in the ground when scared or afraid. In reality, ostriches put their heads in the ground to check on and turn their eggs, which are buried.</p>
<p>Cultural background influences common misconceptions and ironically causes misconceptions about other cultures.</p>
<p>Think about a different nationality or culture other than your own, and imagine what an example of an individual from that culture would look like, what they would wear, what they would eat, or how they would talk. You automatically have a certain idea in your head about each because you view other cultures through the perspective of your own culture.</p>
<p>When <strong>the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in Tenochtitlan, misconceptions influenced their reaction to the Aztec (Mexica) priests</strong>. These misconceptions fueled the conquest of Mexico—they thought that it was crucial to <strong>conquer the indigenous peoples and convert them to Christianity</strong>.</p>
<p>Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a soldier who accompanied Hernan Cortés on his expedition, wrote of his shock in seeing a group of foul-smelling priests with uncut fingernails, long hair matted with blood, and ears covered in cuts. They assumed, based on their cultural perception, that they were savages, when the priests were the most highly educated Aztecs.</p>
<p>The priests were performing rites in honor of the deities they worshiped, including piercing their skin with cactus spines to draw blood. This shocked the Spanish Conquistadors—they viewed the customs as degrading, and their accounts skewed the views of the King of Spain and popular opinion about Aztec (Mexica) and Ancient American culture to this day.</p>
<p>An individual’s cultural filter can contort the accuracies and/or purposes of Ancient American art and its traditions. Examining cultural and religious significance without the scope of your own personal cultural and religious values helps achieve an understanding of the art and architecture produced within the culture.</p>
<p>Overarching artistic traditions of the Ancient Americas exhibit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shamanism</li>
<li>unity with the natural world</li>
<li>animal-based media</li>
<li>focus on the spirit as opposed to the appearance of subjects</li>
<li>creation of objects that have a strong function</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>What&#8217;s Blood Got to Do with It?</strong></h5>
<p>Historically, quests to heal the human body have prompted various medical techniques. It was once thought that evil spirits brought on illness and penetrating the skull was the only way to release the spirits and the illness. This transitioned to the sickness being carried in the life force of a body—blood.</p>
<p>The process was simple—bad or sick blood was drained to allow the body to make new or healthy blood. Monks, surgeon barbers, and doctors practiced this by surgery, cutting, or leeches. Today, doctors use <strong>blood transfusions</strong> when someone is injured, or has cancer or organ dysfunctions in which the body cannot produce new blood.</p>

<p><strong>More Than a Representation</strong></p>
<p>Maya sculptures and reliefs found in temples at Yaxchilan feature images of elite men and women performing bloodletting rituals in extravagant clothing instead of images of deities. Images were carved to commemorate these events in limestone and placed at the top of doorways in important buildings like structures 33 and 40. This art was more than a representation—it was intended to transfer life force. It was participatory and active, rather than for passive viewing.</p>

<h5><strong>Reliefs and Visions</strong></h5>
<p>The temples at Yaxchiln have <strong>several lintels with relief</strong> involving Lady Xok, the principal wife and queen of Shield of Jaguar the Great.</p>
<p>In <strong>Lintel 24</strong>, Lady Xok is performing a bloodletting ritual celebrating the birth of a son to one of the ruler’s other wives. While her husband provides torchlight, she is using a barbed cord to pierce her tongue to experience religious visions.</p>
<p>In <strong>Lintel 25</strong>, Lady Xok is alone and experiencing a vision of a warrior emerging from a snake’s mouth with a spear aimed at her. Experiences like Lady Xok’s vision appear very realistic, and there is nothing in the artwork signifying that it is a vision. It is presented as if it is occurring realistically. This is a common trait in Mesoamerican art—to display mythical events in realistic, figural detail. The connection between the spiritual and mythical was very realistic to the Mesoamerican cultures.</p>
<p>Culturally, the <strong>spiritual and mythical</strong> had a direct impact on their lives, and therefore were represented in a realistic fashion. There was a fine line between natural and supernatural.</p>
<p>Both lintels feature elaborate carving as seen on Lady Xok’s robe. The artists commissioned by royals to create these works were experts and often the second sons of royalty. The intended audiences could be gatherings of priests and nobles inside small temples or for calendrical rituals or possibly supernatural, as many pieces were placed in elaborate graves considered to be in the underworld. The common citizen would be allowed to attend ceremonies celebrating significant events, but they were not intended to view the artwork. Each lintel is also an example of <strong>the important role that elite women played in Mayan society.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Religious Shading</strong></h5>
<p>Visions and sacred themes in artwork are not localized to Ancient America but have been exemplified in various art historical periods. The <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> is a monument reflecting Catholic beliefs and incorporates several images from Catholic doctrine. Commissioned for a hospital in Isenheim, Germany that specialized in certain illnesses, it is dedicated to St. Anthony Abbott.</p>
<p>Many believed the painting had the power to heal those who looked upon it. Vivid imagery and use of color depict the cruelty and violence of Christ&#8217;s death on the first panel. His body is distorted, his wounds and blood are clearly visible, and his flesh is sickly green and covered in sores.</p>

<p><strong>Isenheim altarpiece. Matthias Grünewald. c. 1512–1516 C.E. Oil on wood</strong></p>
<p>Both the <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Lintel 24</em></strong> and <strong>25</strong> contain intense images that demonstrate the <strong><em>reality of pain and death</em></strong>. It is evident just from one scene that Lady Xok had inserted a barbed rope through her tongue, clearly showing her stretched flesh. Her blank facial expression displays the trance-like state she was in, and her vision takes on both animal and human form. The lintels show representations of royalty interacting with the gods. <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> and the Lintel 24 and 25 demonstrate not only the religious values of the cultures they were created within, but also their intended supernatural quality. Audiences were intended to interact with the pieces, and looking at them would have had a spiritual impact.</p>
<h5><strong>Unearthing Connections to the Past</strong></h5>
<p>Archaeology helps to identify specific artistic traditions of artworks—especially excavations of the cities and sites predating the European invasion. Unfortunately, many surviving works were not scientifically extracted, affecting the evidence of the work excavated. Art historians rely on hieroglyphs, specifically those of the Mayas and Mexica, to contextualize text and image, historical, and artistic elements for those cultures. Spanish chronicles by invaders, friars, and colonists provide some information about monuments and artistic practices of the last independent indigenous peoples. Ethnographic analogy can also help identify cultural continuities—present traditional practices and religious beliefs may give light to past practices and beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Nose Ornament. Chavín de Huántar.</strong></p>
<p>These methods assist in finding the cultural context when there are no other methods available, by using examples from those who are culturally similar. This can give light to the possible functions of different artworks or architecture.</p>
<p>For example, art of the Ancient Americas contains objects that have a strong function, commonly religious. This can be in combination with animal-based works and demonstration of unity with the natural world. The <strong>Nose Ornament</strong> found at <strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> is an example of both a religious and animal-based work.</p>
<p>The <strong>elite and royals wore and were buried with symbolic jewelry</strong> to demonstrate connection to deities and religious devotion. This example features two bird-like heads that attached to the ears, along with the central nostril portion.</p>
<p>The Olmecs had a similar practice. They represented their deities in natural forms like animals. By comparing the Chavín to a similar culture like the Olmecs, we can understand the figural representation of deities as animals in their cultural context.</p>
<h5><strong>No Wallflowers Here</strong></h5>
<p>The interaction of art and audiences is also demonstrated in similar cultures, and comparing these cultures gives us insight into the cultural background of this practice. Religious rituals using masks with <strong>animal and mythological representations</strong> were used in Native North America.</p>
<p>Native American tribes, which are culturally like the Ancient Americas, used transformation masks in their healing rituals. This mask is in the shape of an eagle’s head, with ornate painting and detail. The eagle was symbolic of the deities worshiped and was considered a healing animal in Native American cultures. When the wearer pulls the strings, the mask opens, revealing a human face. The human face has bird-like features, including a sharp beak-like nose and flaring nostrils, and when viewed in firelight, represents the transformation from human to eagle form.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pablo Picasso</p></blockquote>
<p>Art historical study enables you to understand art in the light of its cultural and religious significance and not in the scope of your own personal cultural and religious values. In Ancient America, art was figural, realistically represented mythical events, and glorified rulers. It displayed unity with the natural world and connected objects with religious function. Due to European influence, some methods other than archaeology, like ethnographic analogy, assist in finding the cultural context of a piece. Considering these elements will enable unbiased research of cultural analysis and historical research of artworks.</p>
<h4><strong>The Inca&#8217;s New Groove</strong></h4>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Cultural Chairs</strong></h5>
<p>Cultures in Ancient America would build upon and borrow from the previous culture as each culture developed and then weakened. The Maya thrived in the decline of the Olmec, the Teotihuacan in the decline of the Maya, and the Toltec in the decline of the Teotihuacan. The last indigenous group before the Spanish Conquest was the Mexica, or Aztec. The art of each culture influenced that of the succeeding culture. The artworks of the Mexica, for example, reflected that of the Olmec, Teotihuacan, and Toltec.</p>
<p>This is also true in <strong>Andean culture</strong>. The Andean region in South America was home to several cultures that lived in three significantly distinct ecosystems: the dominant Andes Mountains, a narrow desert coast, and the Amazon.</p>
<p>Art of these cultures is <strong>connected to nature</strong>, using, and incorporating natural elements, animal imagery, and plant imagery. The culture practiced artificial mummification, or embalming, of the dead, along with leaving items with the bodies in graves for use in the afterlife. Golden jewelry found in tombs was in natural shapes like birds and other creatures, evidence of both funerary art practices and the connection of natural elements in artworks. The architecture of the Andean region integrated the environment and was a representation of power and social hierarchy within the culture and community.</p>
<h5><strong>Chavín Culture</strong></h5>
<p>One of the oldest cultures, the <strong>Chavín</strong>, was prominent from 900-200 B.C.E. They were a religious culture whose temple at Chavín de Huántar was the destination of religious pilgrimages to experience the <strong><em>Lanzón Stela</em></strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is symbolic of a central figure represented with a feline head and a human body that was worshiped. The temple featured relief sculptures with images of the deities worshiped. Pilgrims would travel long distances in search of religious visions and messages. They would encounter the <strong><em>Lanzón Stela</em></strong> in a series of dark tunnels at the center of the temple. The Chavín culture gave way to cultures such as Nazca, Huari, Chimú, and Chankas.</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that a small tribe called the Inca defeated the Chankas in battle, marking the start of the Inca Empire.</p>

<h5><strong>Birth, Taxes, and Death</strong></h5>
<p>Within the lifespan of five kings, the <strong>Inca</strong> gained control of the west coast of South America, becoming the largest nation in the world at that time, and existed for less than a century.</p>
<p>I<strong>nca</strong> administration was similar to that of the Roman Empire. Although ruling officials changed, local languages and ethnic cultures in the 80 provinces remained intact.</p>
<p>Rulers imposed conformity in religious practices and instituted the <strong>Inca</strong> language, Quechua, as the primary method of communication. Like the Roman Empire, the Inca relocated groups of people within the empire to redistribute uncooperative tribes to loyal areas, while weavers, farmers, stone workers, and artisans were moved to areas where there was a need for their skill set. This contributed to the rapid growth of the Inca Empire and established a complex system of labor taxation. This system required citizens to contribute by providing labor for community-managed lands, for construction needs, for military campaigns, or for textile production.</p>
<p>The goods and services produced were redistributed to the population in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>support of religious needs</li>
<li>support of the emperor, construction, and military campaigns</li>
<li>support of the citizens</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Sweat Shops, the Beginning&#8230;</strong></h5>
<p>The labor taxation system helped produce more than 20,000 miles of roads that encouraged travel and trade and ensured the easy mobility of armies. <strong>Inca textile production</strong> surpassed anything created before the Industrial Revolution, with <strong>thread counts as high as hundreds per inch</strong>.</p>
<p>The dyed woolen cloth of <strong>camelids</strong> was burned in offerings and used as clothing for golden icons—it was highly valued was and was deemed appropriate for the gods. This tunic is the highest-status textile preserved from the Inca Empire. Sixteenth-century illustrations by Guaman Poma de Ayala show Inca rulers in tunics like this one, speculating that it was made for a monarch.</p>

<p><strong>The tunics of All-T&#8217;oqapu tunic. Inka. 1450–1540 C.E. Camelid fiber and cotton.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>toquapus</strong>, or square patterns woven into the fabric, were both decorative and symbols of authority. The patterns and designs on the cloth carried symbolic meaning, including indications of a person’s ethnic identity and social rank. The white-and-black checkerboard with a red V at the top in the <strong>All’T’oqapu</strong> tunic is symbolic of a tiny army uniform, indicating that its wearer was a soldier.</p>
<p>The <strong>All-T’oqapu</strong> tunic has many toquapus that do not follow an overriding pattern. The lack of a specific pattern suggests that the wearer rules over many people. He is both the source of order and above it.</p>
<p>Extensive agricultural terraces helped produce food to support the empire, and monumental architecture functioned as ceremonial and administrative centers. Examples of this architecture include Machu Picchu and Cuzco.</p>
<h5><strong>Machu Picchu</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The City of Machu Picchu</strong> was the royal country estate of the Inca ruler Pachacuti and was utilized by the Inca both as a secret ceremonial city and as a method to institute Incan presence in the area. It resides 9,000 feet above sea level between two high peaks in the Andes Mountains. Looking down on the Urubamba River, the city allowed the Inca to observe and supervise all trade routes and to enforce Incan supervision and influence over the acquired territories.</p>
<p>The resident population was little more than 1,000, and stone buildings occupied terraces around central plazas. It consists of a large temple section as well as palaces, baths, storage rooms, and around 150 houses. Machu Picchu is surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population and watered by natural springs, and it provides an outstanding example of Inca architectural planning. The site of the city is laid out in several zones, including a lower-class residential district and the royalty area.</p>
<p>The City of Machu Picchu was designed with sensitivity to its surroundings.</p>
<p>Buildings were placed specifically so that windows and doors framed views of sacred peaks and landscape. This echoes the shamanistic views of the holiness of nature and exemplifies the instinctive grasp of the harmonious relationship of architecture to the site. The lower-status elite had only one toquapu motif and conformed to rigid design rules.</p>

<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu. </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Inca</strong> were masters of shaping and fitting stone, and they carefully selected stones echoing the shapes of the mountains beyond. This separates the artist from the laborer, as the artist placed emphasis on the harmony of the shapes of the stones. Many of the building blocks weigh 50 tons or more and are precisely sculpted and fitted together without mortar. They feature minimal ornamentation as the Inca sought to display power through the size of the buildings as compared to symbols of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Astronomical Observation</strong></h5>
<p>Ceremonially, <strong>one of Machu Picchu&#8217;s primary functions was an astronomical observatory</strong>, evidenced by the presence of the Intihuatana stone. The large, flat, ornamentation-free stone located near the main square of the city features a projection from the center, which casts a shadow as the sun moves across the sky. It has been shown to be a precise indicator of the date of the two equinoxes on March 21 and September 21, the dates when the sun crosses the equator.</p>
<p><strong>Intihuatana</strong> means “hitching post of the sun” in Quecha, and at these two equinoxes, the sun stands almost directly above the pillar, creating no shadow. It is at this time that the sun is “hitched” to the rock. At these periods, the Incas held ceremonies at the stone in which they &#8220;tied the sun&#8221; to halt its northward movement in the sky.</p>
<p>Intihuatana stones were extremely sacred objects to the Inca people, as they were believed to be the ties of the city to the gods. There were several examples of Intihuatana stones in the Inca Empire, which gives support to the high value of the stones in ceremonies. Shamanic legends tell that when sensitive people touch their forehead to the Intihuatana stone, it opens their vision to the spirit world.</p>
<h5><strong>One city two functions?</strong></h5>
<p>Machu Picchu functioned both politically and religiously. The Incas didn’t have the market cornered on this idea. What about other cultures?</p>

<h5><strong>City of Cusco</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cusco</strong>, the capital of the Inca Empire, was also the symbolic and political center of the Empire. Fifty miles south of Machu Pichu, it served as the home to the ruler and local leaders along with a population of 400,000.</p>
<p><strong>Cusco, which means “naval of the earth,”</strong> was planned in the shape of a puma. This plan was replicated at other sites in the Inca Empire. The puma is significant because it was a symbol of Inca power and the shamanistic reverence of nature. In the city plan, the head of the puma is at the northmost point where the fortress of Sacsahuaman is located. The body is the giant plaza at the center of the town, and the puma’s tail formed by the two rivers that join in the south.</p>

<p><strong>City of Cusco, including Qorikancha (Inka main temple), Santo Domingo (Spanish colonial convent), and Walls at Saqsa Waman (Sacsayhuaman). Central highlands, Peru. Inka. c. 1440 C.E. convent added 1550-1650 C.E. Andesite.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cusco</strong> features the same masonry techniques observed in Machu Picchu. <strong>Stone</strong> was regarded as a special, sacred material. Incas often incorporated living rock as part of a structure. Offerings were made on natural precipices, mountaintops, and other places with untouched stone. This symbiotic relationship enabled buildings to be adapted to natural features and natural features to be incorporated into buildings and cultural events.</p>
<p>Incas used stone to convey political meaning as well as to interact with the spiritual world. The stones, similar to Machu Picchu, were laid without mortar and joined perfectly leaving faint lines of separation between the blocks. The stonemasons accomplished this by sanding and shaping the blocks to fit tightly together.</p>
<p>The <strong>Qorikancha temple</strong> serves as an example of this ancient construction technique mastered by the Inca. Distinguished by the curved surface shown on the front of the building, the Inca originally referred to this site as the <strong>“Temple of the Sun.”</strong> As a temple dedicated to the creator god Viracocha and the gods of the sun, moon, stars, and the elements, the interior of Qorikancha was <strong>coated with sheets of gold, silver, emerald, and life-size statues of silver and gold</strong>. It housed <strong>mummies</strong> of some of the early rulers and was the center of a network of shrines and temples.</p>
<p>The invading Spanish later built the church of Santo Domingo on top of the temple, converting it to fit with their religious customs. They stripped the temple of the gold, silver, jewels, and statues and used different masonry techniques to build the church directly on top of the temple. This was a statement of the disapproval of Inca beliefs and of the European mission to convert the indigenous people to their customs and religious philosophies.</p>

<h4><strong>Native North America</strong></h4>
<p>Ancient American civilizations like the Chavín, Olmec, Maya, Mexica, and Inca grew at an exceptional rate, resulting in densely inhabited agricultural regions until 1534 and the European colonization. But Native North America, the other region in Ancient America, did not have the same vast population.</p>
<p><strong>Native North America includes cultures north of the U.S.-Mexico border from ancient times to the present</strong>. They were primarily hunter-gatherers, though agriculture appeared early in some cases. The indigenous peoples were widespread, unlike those in Ancient America, which had large populations close together.</p>
<p>There are several regional subunits, including the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, and Pueblo, with great variance in religious practices and social organization between the regional groups.</p>

<p><strong>Painted elk hide.</strong></p>
<p>Commonalities were the ideas of harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and ritualistic participation. These shared ideas are represented in artwork that includes geometric patterning, mythical or shamanic figures, and animals.</p>
<p>Artworks were produced in workshops, often with a master training an apprentice. The gender of an artist impacted artistry specialization. Art was produced at the request of a tribal leader, elder, or family member and would be viewed by the tribe in rituals, like in Painted elk hide.</p>
<p>There are vivid images in red, yellow, green, and blue of the tribe performing a Sun Dance ritual. On the outside, warriors riding horses can be seen hunting buffalo. A lack of evidence doesn&#8217;t clarify if these events are occurring at the same time or separately.</p>
<p>Storytelling like this often took place in paintings on hides. Animals were sacred to the indigenous Native Americans, so the use of an elk hide is significant. All animal parts were used to honor the animal. Native American painters would depict important events like battles, buffalo hunts, or ceremonies. These paintings functioned as records for the tribes and would be hung on the wall or worn by one of the warriors or tribal leaders as a tribute to their accomplishments.</p>
<h5><strong>Transformation</strong></h5>
<p>There are varied types of two- and three-dimensional media produced in Native North America. This includes <strong>earthworks, stone and adobe architecture, wood, and bone carving, weaving and basketry, hide painting, ceramics, quillwork, and beadwork</strong>.</p>
<p>Many Native American artworks function as <strong>ritual objects</strong> to wear, carry, or use during special ceremonies in front of large audiences. The more active, or involved, an artwork is, the more it is believed to transfer life force and power. This is evident in Native American tribes&#8217; use of transformation masks with animal and mythological representations in their healing rituals.</p>
<p>The Transformation mask is in the shape of an eagle&#8217;s head, with ornate painting and detail. Painting in dark red, black, white, and green was used to augment and accentuate the basic form on the mask, and this effect was enhanced in firelight. When the mask opens by the wearer pulling strings, a human face is revealed.</p>
<p>The human face has bird-like features, including a sharp beak-like nose and flaring nostrils, and when viewed in firelight, represents the transformation from human to eagle form and a blending of those two forms. The representation of the eagle is especially significant, as it is considered a healing animal with supernatural abilities. The transformation is important as it demonstrates the oneness and harmony with nature.</p>

<h5><strong>European Impact</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1107" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/160-Maize-cobs.jpg?resize=535%2C825&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="535" height="825" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/160-Maize-cobs.jpg?w=214&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/160-Maize-cobs.jpg?resize=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1 195w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The European exploration and settlement of North, Central, and South America had a <strong>significant impact on the indigenous cultures, artwork, and architecture</strong>. When the Spanish conquerors entered the Mexica Empire and Tenochtitlan, they were amazed at the richness and beauty of the land. However, when they observed the priests during bloodletting rituals, idol worship and covered in blood, they regarded the culture as a repulsive cult. They destroyed the religious symbols and illustrated books, and tore down images of deities. Missionaries suppressed local beliefs and practices and worked to spread Christianity throughout the Americas.</p>
<p>In the Incan Empire, smallpox killed much of the population, including the emperor. Treasures like the Maize cobs that adorned an ornamental garden outside the Coricancha were taken back to Spain and melted down. The Coricancha itself was stripped of its riches, consecrated as a Christian building, and the church of Santo Domingo built on top of it. These actions have made stratigraphic archaeology impossible, and archaeologists must rely on written ethnohistoric documents to help give cultural context to artworks.</p>
<p>In Native North America, experts believe that almost 90 percent of the indigenous population died from illnesses introduced by Europeans.</p>
<p>Many groups traded war prisoners as slaves, and the <strong>introduction of European materials influenced how the indigenous cultures lived and the artwork they produced.</strong> European influence affected the content and materials of the Native North Americans to the point that what is now considered traditional is constantly changing.</p>
<p>The Spanish-introduced horse has become a cultural and artistic icon along with the indigenous buffalo; raven and bear and imported materials are now considered traditional. Archaeologists must rely on alternative sources of information for Native North American art, including oral and written tribal history, written ethnohistoric documents, modern artists&#8217; accounts and interviews, and museum records. Historical sources may be inaccurate depending on whether native or European sources are used.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross-Cultural Fertilization</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Bandolier bag</em></strong> represents art produced after European influence in the Native North American cultures. Previously known as hunter bags and used by men, these bags were made of leather, embellished with quillwork, and used for various hunting and farming needs. With the introduction of <strong>imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon</strong>, the materials for the bandolier bags transitioned to cloth and glass beads.</p>
<p><strong>Beadwork</strong> was learned from European settlers and initially mimicked the patterns and colors of quillwork. Quillwork was eventually replaced, and the beadwork incorporated European designs.</p>
<p>As the bandolier bags evolved, they were no longer serving the original function and were worn by the men in celebrations. The <strong><em>Bandolier bag&#8217;s</em></strong> strap features white, red, and turquoise swirl patterns on a black background with gold trim. The bag itself features a pink, white, and turquoise floral pattern, a reproduction of the European designs brought with the colonists. These pieces became symbols of achievement for the women who produced them.</p>
<p>Some Native North American techniques have been untouched by European influence. <strong>Pottery making</strong> in Native North America arose from a need for weather-resistant storage vessels. Traditionally in the Pueblo culture, women were in charge of the home and family, and therefore pottery was viewed as a female&#8217;s occupation.</p>
<p>As time progressed, pottery evolved and the potters began to add creative touches to their pots, transforming them into a dominant art form among the culture. In the 1880s, <strong>Pueblo pottery</strong> began to spread throughout the Southwest with the introduction of the railroad in Pueblo homelands. Trading posts were established near reservations, and tourists and collectors visited to buy Pueblo pottery. Many female potters began to sign their pieces in the 1920s.</p>

<p><strong>Black-on-black ceramic vessel. Maria Martínez and Julian Martínez, Tewa, Puebloan, San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico. c. mid-20th century C.E. Blackware ceramic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maria Montoya Martinez (1887–1980)</strong> was from a Pueblo village 20 miles northwest of Santa Fe. There was no need for traditional Pueblo pottery techniques in the early 1900s—it was not functional in day-to-day lives. With these techniques being lost, Martinez tried different techniques in order to help preserve the cultural art.</p>
<p>The Black-on-black ceramic vessel is crafted in the same manner that Pueblo craftspeople have used since the foundation of their pottery tradition. The pots are hand-coiled, not made on a pottery wheel. Martinez crafted the clay vessels, while her husband, Julian, provided their decoration. While some may say they collaborated equally, Maria received the majority of the credit for their work, reflecting the matriarchal associations with pottery making in their culture.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></p>
<p>The Native North American cultures developed alongside those of Mesoamerican and the Andean region but were less densely populated. The regional tribes, including the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, and Pueblo. They shared ideals of harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and ritualistic participation.</p>
<p>These shared ideals resulted in geometric patterning, mythical or shamanic figures, and animals in the artwork. The European exploration and settlement of North, Central, and South America had a significant impact on the indigenous cultures, artwork, and architecture. In spite of this, there are Native Americans today who maintain their cultural identity and uphold modern versions of ancient traditions.</p>

<h3><strong>Theme: “Incorporation of Natural World”</strong></h3>
<p>Much of the art of the Americas addresses <strong>contact and unity with the natural world, cosmic geometry, and a high value placed on utilizing natural objects in artwork</strong>. Nature is both the subject and the medium for artwork.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context: Art of the Americas</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Large city-states</strong> were developed, and <strong>sacred sites </strong>were often passed down from group to group. Communities were built upon previously existing sites.</p>
<p>There were a wide variety of groups. Some nomadic and hunter-gatherers, others were agriculturalists, some had little technology and others understood medicine, astronomy, and engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Columbian</strong> had a dramatic and near-total destruction of indigenous art, culture, and even life. Europeans flooded into the new world and brought European painting styles with them. Most of the groups were converted to Catholicism primarily.</p>
<h5><strong>Americas</strong></h5>
<p>The Indigenous Americas Concurrent Dates</p>
<p>753 BCE The Founding of Rome</p>
<p>600 BCE Mayan civilization begins in Mexico</p>
<p>325 CE Council of Nicea</p>
<p>476 CE Western Rome falls</p>
<p>632 CE Death of Mohammed</p>
<p>1492 CE Columbus sails, expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Inquisition in high gear</p>
<p>1510’s CE Montezuma, Aztec ruler, receives Cortes and the Spanish Conquistadors Copernicus tells us that the earth revolves around the sun. The American East coast is discovered up to Charleston.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations: Art of the Americas </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Well-adapted to the region: local materials were used in works of art</li>
<li>Most artists were commoners and often employed by state or leaders</li>
<li>Sculpture: varies from intimate works to monumental centerpieces</li>
<li>Art was not meant to just be viewed but is was functional and connected to emphasize a connection to nature.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Cultures and Styles</strong></h5>
<p>The styles from the various Mesoamerican cultures differed markedly.</p>
<p>Three major distinct cultures and styles of Ancient Mesoamerica (Middle America) were the <strong>Olmec</strong>, <strong>Maya</strong>, and Mexica, also known as <strong>Aztec, </strong>the empire that was dominated.</p>
<p>The <strong>Olmec culture</strong> existed during the first millennium BCE, primarily in the Gulf Coast. <strong>The Mayan culture</strong> peaked during the first millennium CE in eastern Mesoamerica, the Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The Mexica culture existed from 1428 to 1521 CE in the region of central Mexico, though subordinating most of Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>There were other important cultures including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teotihuacan</strong></li>
<li><strong>Toltec</strong></li>
<li><strong>West Mexican</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mixtec</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zapotec</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pre-Columbian </strong></h4>
<p>Pre-Columbian refers to the period in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans and Christopher Columbus in 1492.</p>
<h4><strong>Olmec Culture</strong></h4>
<p>The Olmec are considered the <strong>first Mesoamerican civilization</strong> and were the foundation for the<strong> pre-Columbian civilizations.</strong> They lived in what today is Mexico and Guatemala and flourished between 1500-400 BCE.</p>
<h5><strong>Heads and Masks</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Olmec began to create great sculptures</strong> made of stone as well as carvings made from jade or serpentine. The artists used stone chisels and simple utensils to carve and polish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1226" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Colossal-Head.jpg?resize=277%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="277" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Colossal-Head.jpg?w=277&amp;ssl=1 277w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Colossal-Head.jpg?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1 208w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This <strong>Colossal Head</strong> above, is made from basalt and has been dated to 1200-400 BCE. It was found in San Lorenzo, Veracruz, Mexico. Today it is housed in the Anthropology Museum of Xalapa, in Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>This <strong>colossal human head is emblematic for the Olmec art</strong>. Seventeen such heads were found in the low-lying Gulf Coast area of Mexico in the cities of San Lorenzo, La Venta, Tres Zapotes. They measure from 1.5 meters to 3.5 meters in height and weight from 6 to 50 tons and are carved in a volcanic rock called basalt.</p>
<p>The apogee of the Olmec cities happened almost at the same time as Remus and Romulus founded Rome and Athenians reached their Golden Age. The impressive cultural legacy of the Olmec cities (2000-400 BCE) spread throughout ancient Mexico during the first millennium BCE.</p>
<p>Later <strong>Mesoamerican cultures such as the Maya and Aztec revered the Olmec artworks</strong> and used them as burial items or as offerings to the gods. This was the case of the Olmec-style jadeite head mask brought from a distant Gulf area. It was ritually buried in an offerings’ pit in the main plaza of the Aztec main temple, Templo Mayor (1375-1520 CE), Tenochtitlan (Mexico City, Mexico).</p>

<p>The <strong>Olmec mask carving</strong> at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, featured above dates between 900-400 BCE and is made of jadeite. Although it looks like a mask, it was not worn this way as <strong>it does not have cut outs for the eyes and nose.</strong></p>
<p>While the stylized Olmec like mask is small, almost the size of a human palm, and the head is a realistically carved megalith, they both represent heads wearing a helmet. The mask only suggests having it, by the means of the smooth, highly polished forehead.</p>
<p>These artworks are traditionally interpreted as portraits of chiefs, kings, ancestors, or deities dressed for a ball game, being early evidence for the importance of a ballgame in the cultures of Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>The head-like figures symbolized the very concept of rulership either by a colossal imposing and sturdy presence or by a smaller representation using a more expensive material and incorporating symbolic animal traits.</p>
<h5><strong>Made with a Single Block</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Olmec heads and masks</strong> were <strong>carved from a single block of stone</strong>. The work demanded by both artworks was immense as both basalt and jadeite are hard to carve. The large sections were sawed with string and grit. The face details would have been made by an abrasion method followed by polishing.</p>
<p>The abrasion method would have required the rubbing of the same kind of very hard stone onto the artwork and the use of a mixture of sand and water as an abrasive.</p>
<p>For <strong>smaller sized ritual objects</strong> such as masks and axes, the Olmecs favored the expensive <strong>green-blue jadeite</strong>. They associated the greenstone with <strong>fertility and growing corn</strong>, and they retrieved it from the faraway Guatemalan mountains.</p>
<h5><strong>In Comparison</strong></h5>
<p>The faces have a strong jawline and very simplified elongated ears that frame the face. The same specific parts of the head have more volume and relief, looking almost fleshy. Note the chin, the nose, and the upper lip. The faces show aesthetic maturity and individuality as no two heads or masks are alike. They also have lifeless traits.</p>
<p><strong>The colossal head</strong> looks severed. Since <strong>the mask</strong> is unwearable It was probably either a costume element, or a mummy mask. The mask is almost modern showing a remarkable simplicity and elegance. It reflects the cult of a mythical human-jaguar being, the “were-jaguar” through symbolic facial features such as the slanted, almond eyes, and the slightly downturned mouth. Note the drilled cleft marks, also called jaguar snarl.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the basalt colossal stone head is more detailed and realistic. The feline traits that constitute the later divinity signs in Olmec art are absent in this colossal head. Its helmet-like headdress is adorned with distinctive elements symbolizing a group membership.</p>
<p>Other symbolic elements might have been the large ear spools inserted into the ear lobes. We know that the later Maya considered holes and passages of all kinds as points of entry into the supernatural world. They wore jade ear spools to symbolically mark the passageways for the soul. One of the most common Maya phrases for death, och bih (literally &#8220;to enter/go on”).</p>
<h5><strong>Olmec Architecture </strong></h5>
<p><strong>La Venta</strong> Olmec site, in Tabasco, Mexico, from 394 BCE has a The Great Pyramid in the center. It stands 110 feet high and is one of the earliest pyramids known in Mesoamerica. It is rectangular in shape, with stepped sides and inset corners, although this could be due to erosion.</p>
<p>The Altar 4 at La Venta, it is roughly 2 meters high and twice as wide. It has a sculpture with elaborate dress carved into it, which makes the figures appear to be sitting in the mouth of a cave.</p>

<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Yaxchilan’s <strong>ruling dynasty</strong> rose in the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE. By the 8<sup>th</sup> century, the  Mayan cultural and political Renaissance was led by <strong>Shield Jaguar II</strong>. He ruled for 60 years from 681-741 CE and commissioned this site as well as many sculptural works.</p>
<p>Shield Jaguar had a son <strong>Bird Jaguar</strong> with his second wife. Shield Jaguar chose Bird Jaguar to be the next ruler, even though he was not royal because he did not come from the first wife.</p>
<p>Then from 741 – 752 <strong>Civil War</strong> raged.</p>
<p><strong>Bird Jaguar</strong> ruled from  752 – 768. He had difficulty being accepted by the Mayans because he <strong>lacked royal status. </strong>Therefore, many did not consider him the rightful heir to the throne.  To legitimize his throne, he had decorative steles and reliefs added to Yaxchilan.</p>
<p>The City-state of Yaxchilan <strong>collapsed in the 9<sup>th</sup> century</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a fact: </strong>Maya writing was not fully deciphered until the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<h5><strong>Women and the Maya Court </strong></h5>
<p>Women played <strong>a prominent role</strong> in the Maya court.  They held positions as queens and mothers. Being a principal wife meant that you were believed to have particularly significant power and became part of the bloodletting ritual&#8212; central to legitimizing kingship.</p>
<p><strong>Digs in Structure 23 have found sharp objects for bloodletting with Lady Xoc’s name on them.</strong> It is assumed she is buried somewhere around the temple.</p>
<p>It was believed that when a member of the royal family shed his or her blood, a portal to the other world was opened allowing gods and spirits to pass through it.  <strong>Letting blood was a sign of sacrifice and piety</strong> to acquire the favor of the gods. This helped to dedicate new buildings, legitimize kings, and commemorate births of children.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodletting for queens</strong> was believed to grant significant visions. However, medically, these visions were <strong>hallucinatory states</strong> resulting from large amounts of blood loss.</p>
<h5><strong>Other Mayan Works to Note</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Tulum</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_1364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1364" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1364" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Main-temple-at-Tulum-by-Frederick-Catherwood-Wikipedia.jpg?resize=610%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="610" height="441" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Main-temple-at-Tulum-by-Frederick-Catherwood-Wikipedia.jpg?w=610&amp;ssl=1 610w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Main-temple-at-Tulum-by-Frederick-Catherwood-Wikipedia.jpg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1364" class="wp-caption-text">Main temple at Tulum, by Frederick Catherwood (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Tulum</strong> sits high on a cliff overlooking the waters of the Caribbean Sea in the Yucatan peninsula, of Mexico. Although the exact date of the building is unknown, evidence of human occupation dates to 564 BCE.  The remains of Tulum today, include buildings, tombs, and platforms, inside the walls. Here, visitors find outstanding examples of Mayan culture.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Outer Wall</strong> was built for both defence and to separate religious structures. The Inner Precinct has the most important buildings. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Castle</li>
<li>The Temple of the Descending God</li>
<li>The Temple of the Initial Series</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Castle </strong></h5>
<p>The most important monument in Tulum is El Castillo (The Castle). Reaching to 25 feet tall, it stands at the front of a bluff overlooking the ocean. The castle was a shrine and a center to host ceremonies. At night-time, when the torches were lit, the building helped to navigate boats through the coral reefs. The Mayan were traders with a reach as far as Honduras.</p>
<h5><strong>The Temple of the Descending God</strong></h5>
<p>This is a well-preserved building. The temple is built upon another flat roofed structure. Murals decorated the façade. Intertwining snakes, the sun, rain, and the corn god can still be seen.</p>
<p>A small stairway leads to the one room temple. Inside are two benches and a window. Above the doorway, there is a winged god crafted in stucco. Inside, the hand painted walls illustrate offerings, under a blue border. This symbolizes the night sky.</p>
<h5><strong>The Temple of the Initial Series</strong></h5>
<p>This one room building has a stone lintel on the outside and a wood one on the inside. Two figures once flanked the door, but now only a partial one remains. Inside, the same figures decorate each corner. A small alter still remains. A broken stele was found and now housed in the British Museum.</p>
<p>The roof is a curved arc. Small windows look out to the south, east, and west.</p>
<h5><strong>Other Structures of the Inner Precinct  </strong></h5>
<p>Within the Inner Precinct there are also temples, shrines, and a platform. The shrines are built lower than the temples. The walls here are low and used for the purpose of separating the buildings.</p>
<p>Historians believe the platform was used for dances and other performances. It has stairways on each side.</p>
<h4>The Aztecs</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Aztecs were hunters/gatherers</li>
<li>Advanced agricultural techniques using all available land</li>
<li>Developers of superior irrigation systems</li>
<li>Enacted a power structure where provinces maintained their own culture and language</li>
<li>Everyone had to worship<strong> Huītzilōpōchtli,</strong> the sun god of war and human- sacrifice</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Aztecs</strong> were a powerful group that made up the diverse indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. They encountered Spaniards in 1519. Although the Europeans would later refer to them as Aztecs, <strong>the people called themselves Mexica. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Deities  </strong></h5>
<p>Deities were a huge part of Aztec religion. The two most important were <strong>Huitzilopochtli</strong> and <strong>Tlatoc </strong>a rain and agricultural god.</p>
<p>Others include:</p>
<p><strong>Tezcatlipoca</strong> (“Smoking Mirror”), patron of rulers and is symbolized with the mirror he wears. He was also associated with sorcery.</p>
<p><strong>Quetzalcoatl </strong>(“Feathered Serpent”), was associated with the planet Venus, fertility, and wind.</p>
<p><strong>Chalchiuhtlicue</strong> (“She of the Jade Skirt”) a goddess associated with lakes, rivers, and fertility.</p>
<p><strong>Chicomecoatl </strong>(“Seven Serpent”) and <strong>Cinteotl</strong> (“Maize God”), were both connected to with maize and sustenance</p>
<p><strong>Mictlancihuatl </strong>(“Lady of Mictlan”) and <strong>Mictlantecuhtli </strong>(“Lord of Mictlan”), deities of death and the underworld.</p>
<h5><strong>Art in Aztec Times</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Stone sculptures</li>
<li>Terracotta sculptures</li>
<li>Murals</li>
<li>Codices</li>
<li>Featherwork</li>
<li>Mosaics</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Gleaming City</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The city of Tenochtitlán</strong>, in central Mexico was <strong>founded by the Aztec people</strong> in 1325. During the 15<sup>th</sup> century it was the capital of the growing Aztec empire. It was also the largest city in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica until Spain took it in 1521. By then, it was the fourth largest city in the entire world with an estimated 350,000 people.</p>
<p>Prior to the Spanish invasion, the Aztecs dominated all tribes in Mexico. This was quite the feat for a settlement started on an island in a swampy lake.</p>
<p>Cortez made the mistake of calling for the city to be destructed, so new Spanish buildings could be built on top. This caused <strong>Tenochtitlán</strong>, to sink deep into the lake. Templo Mayer would not be rediscovered until the 20<sup>th</sup> century!</p>
<ul>
<li>The city covered 5.2 square miles</li>
<li>Built on a series of islets</li>
<li>Divided into four city sections.</li>
<li>Each section was divided into 20 districts</li>
<li>Canals were used for transportation</li>
<li>The inner city was comprised of 45 public buildings, temples, schools and a large ceremonial center.</li>
<li>Buildings were made of stone</li>
<li>Homes were made from wood and loam with reed rooftops</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Templo Mayor (Main Temple)</em></strong> is in<strong> Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City, Mexico).  The main temple is made from stone, </strong>while <strong>volcanic stone </strong>was used to form the<strong> Coyolxauhqui Stone. </strong>Meanwhile,<strong> jadeite </strong>was used to create the<strong> Olmec-style mask </strong>and <strong>basalt for the Calendar Stone.  </strong></p>
<p>The temple is like a ziggurat or stepped mastaba, with a double-wide staircase that leads to a plateau, and two smaller temples on top. It was expanded upon by many different rulers and continually enlarged. This has resulted in a complex system of rooms and chambers on the interior.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was Templo Mayor Built? </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Templo Mayor</strong> was built to honor the gods Tlaloc and Huitzilopochli. Tlaloc was the god of water, rain, agriculture, and fertility. The Aztecs created the blue and white Northern temple for this god.  Huitzilopochli was the god of warfare, fire, sun and sacrifice and the Southern temple of white and red was built for this god. Together, the gods symbolized “burning water” which connoted warfare.</p>
<p>The structure shows the <strong>Aztec belief that they could control and influence the cosmos.</strong> The spring and autumn equinox rise between the two temples. <strong>Templo Mayor</strong> was believed to be an axis mundi. It sat on the center of the four quadrants of the empire as a small version of the universe. It illustrated power, piety, and place of worship both daily and otherwise. It was the space where sacrifice occurred.</p>

<p>This circular <strong>stone, carved in low relief</strong>, was <strong>originally painted</strong> and measures <strong>11 feet across</strong>. It represents the daughter of the maternal earth deity. The name means bells-on-her-face (golden bells decorate her cheeks). She is shown naked with sagging breasts and a stretched belly to indicate that she was a mother. She is also shown decapitated and dismembered.</p>
<p>The story is arranged in a pinwheel shape.  Coyol’s mother Coatlicue becomes pregnant.  Coyol is angry and with her 400 brothers, they attack Coatlicue. H emerges fully clothed and armed to defend his mother. He beheads Coyol and throws her body down a great mountain</p>
<p>This Parallels the Aztec cosmos. <strong>Coatlicue (Earth)</strong> gives birth to <strong>H (sun)</strong> who <strong>kills Coyol by slicing her (moon) </strong>while their <strong>siblings (stars)</strong> watch.</p>
<p>This stone is <strong>located at the bottom of the staircase</strong> of the Templo Mayor. By placing this at the bottom, the Aztecs made their temple parallel to the mountain. Victims were sacrificed on the top. Then, their bodies were rolled down the staircase to fall atop the Coyol stone and to re-enact this myth. This was a powerful reminder to submit to Aztec authority.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>The <strong>Calendar Stone</strong> is a round, monolithic, low relief sculptural work that measures <strong>12 feet in diameter and weighs 24 tons</strong>. It would have set on the ground or on a table.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not a calendar</strong>, but rather <strong>it records the cosmos</strong> as the Aztecs saw it. Priests used the calendar stone to <strong>determine sacrificial periods</strong>. It shows the authority, religiosity, and responsibility of the Aztecs to continue the cycle of time by continuing sacrifice.</p>

<p>It may have been the stone Aztec priests sacrificed victims on and placed in front of Huitzilopochli’s temple. In the Aztec creation story the gods called for human blood to repay the debt to the gods who sacrificed themselves to create humans. Therefore, <strong>human sacrifice was needed.</strong> The Aztecs had a cyclical world view in that time repeated and started over. The way to move forward was with sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the center we see Tlaltecuhtli the devouring earth god or Tonatiuh the sun god. The god is wearing earrings. The tongue is a sacrificial blade, and the hands hold a human heart.</p>
<p>Around the image is a sun shape that moves outward. The largest ray of sun points towards the cardinal directions. This is surrounded by a ring of 20 days – the basic unit of the Aztec calendar.</p>
<p><strong>The cosmos was divided into four quadrants. So was Tenochtitlan and Templo Mayor.</strong> Other imagery represents different seasonal cycles and representations of gods/goddesses.</p>

<p>This mask is made from jadeite, which is a hard, green stone. Minerally, it is slightly different than jade.  The mask was not Aztec or made in Central Mexico but made 1,000 years earlier. It was brought here and was found in <strong>Templo Mayor</strong>, indicating its importance.</p>
<p>Art historians have a theory that it was probably worn around the neck during sacrifice and left at the temple for the gods. It was likely made by a group influenced by the Olmecs (Olmecs decline in 250 BCE or so). The Aztecs likely wanted to affiliate themselves with the Olmecs to draw a parallel between a great empire of the past (Olmecs) and a great empire now (Aztecs). This is just like how European kings constantly made associations between themselves and Roman emperors.</p>
<p>Thousands of objects have been found at the <strong>Templo Mayor</strong>. Some offerings demonstrated the Aztec’s awareness of the historical/cultural traditions of Mesoamerica.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Originally, the city Tenochtitlan was established on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, which is now Mexico City. Between 1519-1521 it was conquered by the Spaniards. Then it was flattened to build Mexico City upon. This was completed as a sign of European supremacy. It was discovered during an excavation in Mexico City in 1978.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong> was a major theme among Aztec religion. There was a belief was that<strong> Huitzilopochli needed energy every day to raise the sun</strong>. This <strong>required daily sacrifice</strong> and the priests would ritually eat the heart to symbolize Huitzilopochli’s intake of the sacrifice. This was used for intimidation for enemies.</p>

<p><strong>Ruler’s feather headdress </strong>(probably of Motecuhzoma II) is made from <strong>feathers </strong>(quetzal and cotinga) and <strong>gold</strong>. The work measures <strong>3 feet 9 inches high.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>400 feathers</strong> symbolize eternity in Aztec culture.</p>
<p>The <strong>quetzal feathers</strong> only come from the male bird which has two to three tail feathers. The bird is only found in Costa Rica. This is an indication of long-distance trade that Aztecs participated in. It may also be a sign of tribute gifts given to Aztecs.</p>

<p>Leather straps attach the crown to the head of a wearer. There are also ornamentations made of <strong>pure gold</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This head dress is a display of status and power by Motecuhzoma. It is part of a more elaborate costume that would have included earrings, tassels, and necklaces for rituals. The ruler would have had to walk up the steps of the Templo Mayor wearing these items. This displayed control over his own body and a superhuman strength and poise.</p>
<p>This work was sent by Spanish conquistador Cortes to HRE Charles V. It was meant not only to impress Charles V, but to encourage him to continue funding expeditions to the New World.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>This headdress was likely worn by <strong>Motecuhzoma II</strong> who was <strong>the last Aztec king</strong>. He was captured, kept as a hostage, and killed by Spaniards.  Cortes conquered the Aztecs by 1521.</p>

<p>This headdress is exceptional. It impressed the Europeans because at the time they had never seen anything like it.</p>
<h4><strong>The Central Andes</strong></h4>
<p>The ancient <strong>Central Andes</strong> comprised present-day southern <strong>Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia</strong>, and northern <strong>Chile</strong>. General cultural similarities across the Andes included an emphasis on surviving and interacting with the <strong>challenging environments, reciprocity, and cyclicality</strong>, rather than individualism. There was a reverence for the <strong>animal and plant worlds</strong> as part of the practice of <strong>shamanistic religion</strong>.</p>
<p>As with ancient Mesoamerica, the Central Andes region was a seat of culture and art parallel to the “Old World” in antiquity, diversity, and sophistication. <strong>Baskets</strong> from this region have been found dating to as early as 8800 BCE, proving early peopling from Asia through the rest of the Americas was accomplished by Neolithic times.</p>
<p>The culture practiced <strong>artificial mummification, or embalming</strong>, of the dead, along with <strong>leaving items with the bodies</strong> in graves for use in the afterlife. <strong>Golden jewelry found in tombs</strong> was in natural shapes like birds and other creatures, evidence of both funerary art practices and the connection of natural elements in artworks. The architecture of the Andean region integrated the environment and was a representation of power and social hierarchy within the culture and community.</p>
<p><strong>Chavín</strong> and <strong>Inka</strong> were representative and distinct early and late cultures and styles. <strong>Chavín </strong>lived in the northern highlands with reach to the southern coast between 1200–500 BCE. While the <strong>Inka </strong>between 1438–1534 CE covered the entire Central Andes. Yet many other important, art producing cultures existed between them.</p>
<h5><strong>Chavín Culture</strong></h5>
<p>Chavins were a religious culture whose temple at <strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> was the destination of religious pilgrimages to experience the <strong>Lanzón Stela</strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is symbolic of a central figure represented with a feline head and a human body that was worshiped. The temple featured relief sculptures with images of the deities worshiped. Pilgrims would travel long distances in search of religious visions and messages. They would encounter the Lanzón Stela in the midst of a series of dark tunnels at the center of the temple. The Chavín culture gave way to cultures such as Nazca, Huari, Chimú, and Chankas.</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that a small tribe called the Inca defeated the Chankas in battle, marking the start of the Inca Empire.</p>
<h5><strong>Inca Culture</strong></h5>
<p>Within the lifespan of five kings, the <strong>Inca gained control of the west coast of South America</strong>, becoming the largest nation in the world at that time, and existed for less than a century.</p>
<p><strong>Inca administration was like that of the Roman Empire</strong>&#8212; although ruling officials changed, local languages and ethnic cultures in the 80 provinces remained intact. <strong>Rulers imposed conformity in religious practices and instituted the Inca language</strong>, Quechua, as the primary method of communication.</p>
<p>Like the Roman Empire, the Inca <strong>relocated groups of people within the empire</strong> to redistribute uncooperative tribes to loyal areas, while weavers, farmers, stone workers, and artisans were moved to areas where there was a need for their skill set. This contributed to the rapid growth of the Inca Empire and established a complex system of labor taxation. This system required citizens to contribute by providing labor for community-managed lands, for construction needs, for military campaigns, or for textile production.</p>
<p>The goods and services produced were redistributed to the population in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>support of religious needs</li>
<li>support of the emperor, construction, and military campaigns</li>
<li>support of the citizens</li>
</ul>

Site-specific</p>
<p><strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> is a <strong>stone</strong> (complex) in the <strong>Andean highlands of Peru</strong> and sits at an <strong>elevation of 10,330 feet. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The site is important for three reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It sits between eastern and western ranges of the Andes where the landscape moves from desert/beach to jungle, and it is seen as an important zone of transition.</li>
<li>Located near the confluence of two rivers (Huachesca and Mosna) it is considered a spiritually powerful phenomenon.</li>
<li>Also, as one of the most elevated sites it is closer to the divine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The temple complex is comprised of two buildings:</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>U-shaped Old Temple </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Open to the east, where the sun rises</li>
<li>Interior of temple was full of tunnels, called galleries</li>
<li>Tunnels all existed in total darkness: no windows</li>
<li>Many smaller tunnels acted as air passageways</li>
<li>Tunnels, being made of stone, had perfect acoustics</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Rectangular New Temple</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Also has a rectangular sunken court </span></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The temple site is <strong>dedicated to Lanzon god</strong>. This god ensured the harvest, fertility, and abundance was represented in the form of a stele. Lanzon was also known as the smiling god and is often represented smiling.</p>
<p>The temple became <strong>a significant pilgrimage</strong> site across the Chavin empire. The cultural effect of this pilgrimage site was that it became a melting pot of cultures, languages, and art forms. People from all over brought their styles to this site.</p>

<p><strong>Lanzon god</strong> is represented in the form of a stela. The notched shape wedge is over 15 feet tall.</p>
<p>Illustrated as a human-feline hybrid with eyes gazing upward, it has a feline mouth with great fangs.</p>
<p>The <strong>left arm</strong> is down, while the <strong>right arm</strong> raises up with claw-like nails. <strong>Fangs and talons </strong>are associated with the jaguar – the top predator in the Andes. <strong>Eyebrows and hair</strong> of the figure are rendered as snakes in reference to the passage of time.</p>

<p>This work depicts the Lanzon god using <strong>contour rivalry. </strong>This is a representational form that uses a complex and deliberately visually confusing style allowing the viewers to see what is there&#8212; only if they know what to look for! This creates a barrier between believers who can see the true form and those who cannot.</p>
<p>The technique uses two images with shared parts or outlines. This was a common technique to delineate “true followers” from the masses.</p>
<p>Located deep within the Old Temple tunnels at the intersection of several galleries, this might have been erected before the building and then the building was built around it.</p>
<p>It is built between the ceiling and floor as to indicate its role as conduit between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Lanzon means “great spear” or “great blade” in Spanish. This is a reference to the stone’s shape but also the shape of a digging stick used in traditional highland agriculture. No one knows the specifics of the rituals that unfolded in this site.</p>

<p>A <strong>nose ornament</strong> pinches or passes through the septum. This one is a clip on. Once on the nose the snakes lay on the cheeks. It was worn to indicate wealth, religion, and affiliation with the Lanzon cult.</p>
<p><strong>Metallurgy</strong> is a main art form of the Chavin.  The gold is formed by hammering and cutting. Gold was believed to transform the wearer. It was considered spiritually powerful. Elite men and women were buried with these.</p>
<h5><strong> More About the Chavin</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chavin </strong>were a pre-Inca civilization <strong>along the Andes in South America</strong>. They lived in a very diverse, large area of the Andes.</p>
<p>The Chavin were very skilled in metallurgy and in particular, gold.  Animals were often depicted into the imagery of deities.</p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Comparison: </strong></h5>
<p><strong>How does the Chavín de Huántar compare to other sacred architecture?</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Chartres Cathedral</strong></h5>
<p>Another <strong>pilgrimage destination</strong>, the <strong>Chartres Cathedral</strong> is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and is one of the oldest Christian shrines in France. It is the site where a piece of linen is kept that is believed to have been worn by the Virgin Mary when she gave birth to Jesus. This linen is believed to have healing powers and, therefore, is the focus of religious pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The European Gothic cathedral has a u-shaped cross (basic early Christian Basilica) floor plan and was constructed in several stages. It is permeated with stained-glass windows, which allow large amounts of natural light to enter the chapel. This light was referred to as lux nova as it entered through what were considered sacred windows. Featured on the west façade are a large, round stained-glass window and the Royal Portal. The Royal Portal features sculptures of biblical kings and queens on the columns. Above is Christ on a throne surrounded by four evangelists, an example of early Gothic sculpture.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Chavín de Huántar and Chartres Cathedral</strong> have objects that worshipers see to encounter sacred experiences, and they functioned as pilgrimage destinations. They were both constructed in several stages to accommodate their sacred function. While Chavín de Huántar is impacted by the lack of windows and natural light, the Chartres Cathedral’s extensive stained-glass windows use an extraordinary amount of natural light to meet worship needs.</p>
<h5><strong>A Comparison of Sculptural Works</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Despite the technical and morphological differences between the <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira</strong> and pre-Columbian <strong>Chavin de Huantar’s sculptures (the Staff God of the Raimondi Stele and El Lanzon hidden in the Old Chavin Temple)</strong>, these objects had a visual propaganda function in the Umayyad and Chavin de Huantar cultures. They systematically combined images of power —images of the legitimate Umayyad heir in the pyxis and images of humans in the process of transformation into predators at Chavin—with threatening messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The artistic style of the ivory carvings of the pyxis and of the stone carvings of the Staff God and of the El Lanzon exhibits horror vacui, or the fear of leaving an empty space, which makes the political message of the artworks deliberately complex, confusing. Thus, their message for the outsiders is superficial, while those with a spiritual <strong>(Chavin)</strong> or political knowledge <strong>(Umayyad)</strong> can fully decipher the artwork.</p>
<p>The <strong>ivory objects</strong> produced in Al-Andalus between 950-1050 CE <strong>boxes or pyxides</strong> were most often used as a container for precious materials (perfumes, cosmetics) or insignia of power (regalia) and they were for the most part produced in the Madinat al-Zahra workshops of the Caliphate of Córdoba. We can safely assume that these objects were status symbolic gift for life cycle occasions in family the of the caliph such as marriage, birth, and coming of age. Most of these ivories mention the name of recipient of the gift, as well as the artist, the place, and the year.</p>
<p>The lid of the pyxis shows two lions symbolizing the Umayyads and a Kufic calligraphic inscription blessing the al-Mughira: “G-d’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may G-d have mercy upon him”.</p>
<p>There is a repeated presence of <strong>royal iconographic symbols</strong> such as <strong>falcons, lions, and a lute player</strong> flanked by two princely figures. One holds the braided scepter and flask of the Umayyads, while the other only holds a fan. There are men on horseback <strong>date-picking</strong>. The dates allude to the lost lands of Syria.</p>
<p>This indicates that <strong>a political message</strong> was sent to the prince. This message uses the preexisting royal symbolism manipulating it through wisdom fables. The revised royal iconography now no longer appears as proof of the virtues of the “sovereign” but rather suggest the legitimacy of the heir.</p>
<p>The depictions of agricultural and abundance becomes an argument for the caliph’s legitimacy and his innate art of governing.</p>
<p>One of the main lobes shows two young boys stealing eggs from an eagle’s nest. They are bitten by dogs. This is probably a reference to the quest for sovereignty. The Umayyads of Spain were known as ‘the falcons of the Quraysh’ and Cordoba was sometimes compared to an egg.  As a present to the caliph’s 2nd son, it is an allegoric warning to not break the succession line.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1053" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-57.-Front-View.jpg?resize=323%2C431&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="323" height="431" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-57.-Front-View.jpg?w=323&amp;ssl=1 323w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-57.-Front-View.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Another shows two riders picking dates accompanied by two wolfs/dogs pulling down by the tail two birds that are trying to eat the seeds of the palm tree symbol of the lost lands of Umayyads.</p>
<p>The last image contains a very clear warning. It uses the image of a lion that overpowers a bull. The image might be a simple assertion of the power of the lion (caliph’s heir) or might depict a story from Indian fables translated by the Umayyads in Castilian. The story in which the Lion Kills the Bull is emblematic of two friends whom a liar jackal contrives to disunite. The political warning is even more relevant given that later Al Mughira was assassinated on the day in which his brother died to prevent any claim he might have had against his young nephew.</p>
<p>Located in the Northern Highlands of Peru, on a trade route between the coast and the Amazon basin, the site of <strong>Chavin de Huantar</strong> was an important religious center between 900 and 200 BCE dominating an extended territory from the highlands to the coast. The ceremonial center controlled the Andean social life through religious leadership. The priests of Chavin held both public and exclusive (in the temple interiors) spiritual ceremonies and rituals during which the intoxicated believers interacted with the supernatural anthropomorphic gods depicted in several of the site&#8217;s sculptures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chavin sculptures</strong> draw on the ancient fear and reverence of humans in front of the apex predators (<strong>snake, caymans, jaguar, hawks</strong>) and use their features to enhance the power of the priests and their control over the masses of believers. An outsider could still perceive the power of the sculptures by identifying toothed mouths, emerging animal limbs or snakes, but he/she would be unable to identify the primary figure and make sense of the iconography used.</p>
<p><strong>El Lanzon and the Staff god</strong> from the Raimundi stella exhibit <strong>contour rivalry</strong> which is a representational technique that uses two images with shared parts or outlines, usually a human with features of a predator. The Lanzon deity has jaguar fangs and caiman talons, and its eyebrows and hair is represented through snakes. The fearsome Staff God also has the same downturned mouth with feline fangs. His head is multi-faced. The stacked headdress is composed of more cayman (also spelled caiman—which is an alligatoridae) faces terminated in curls and snake heads.</p>
<p>By flipping the stele, the god becomes benevolent as its headdress is transformed into a stack of smiling caiman faces. The visually confusing style creates a hierarchy between intimated believers who can see true form and those who cannot.</p>
<p>With an iconography of power symbols, the Chavin society uses art to expand its power and transitions from an egalitarian state (in which people are close to equal in status and power, and permanent leadership is rare) to a hierarchical state with differences in rights and power between segments of the population, and a strong, usually hereditary leadership.</p>
<p>Both objects survived the destruction of the caliphate and of the <strong>pre-Columbian Chavin civilization.</strong> While the new Christian owners of the pyxis and today’s Peruvians appreciate the artworks material value and technical excellence, their powerful grip on people was lost together, with most of their symbolism.</p>

<p><strong>City of Cusco</strong> is located in <strong>the central highlands, of Peru</strong>, at an elevation of 11,200 feet. The city was designed to look like a miniature Inca empire.</p>
<p><strong>City of Cusco</strong> is divided into two sections. The <strong>north </strong>is where the<strong> upper class lived.</strong> The word for north is <strong>hanan.</strong> The <strong>south</strong> part of the city or <strong>hurin</strong> was where the lower classes lived.  The two sections were also further divided into quarters. This reflected the four corners of the empire. It takes on the shape of a puma/ jaguar, which is the royal animal of the Inca.</p>
<p>The <strong>masonry </strong>is special and unique to the region. Each individual stone is fitted uniquely to the one placed next to it. This results in blocks that have a varied number of sides. The goal is to keep each stone as true to its original shape as possible, but just flattened on the sides presented. This means the  blocks were not going to be like bricks.  Stones that are fitted this way allow for a small amount of movement. This is especially important in an earthquake-prone region. The modern city of Cusco is over a fault line.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of the City of Cusco </strong><strong> </strong></h5>

<li>Capital of the Inca empire</li>
<li>Civic center: religious; political; marketplace</li>
<li>Believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi</strong> (especially the temple of Qorikancha)</li>
<li>Way for Inca rulers to display their power and their ability to shape and order their empire

<ul>
<li>Located on the heart of the puma</li>
<li>Qorikancha means “Golden House”</li>
<li>Most sacred of all Inca temples/shrines (<strong>axis-mundi</strong>)</li>
<li>Dedicated to the worship of the sun and sun god Inti</li>
<li>Center of the empire (like the sun in the universe) and everything radiated outward from it</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>masonry technique</strong> was even more time-consuming than normal Inca fitted stonework. Rather than fitting each stone together and creating an irregular-looking surface, each stone was <strong>shaped into a rectangular block</strong> and polished to a smooth finish.</p>
<p>The walls were then <strong>covered in sheets of gold</strong> to signify the shrine’s dedication to Inti. This would have brilliantly reflected the sun’s rays and embodied the purpose of the building.</p>
<p>In front was a <strong>sculpture garden</strong> with reproductions of the world in miniature containing, people, animals, and plants.</p>
<p><strong>After the Spanish conquest</strong>, Qorikancha was one of <strong>many shrines turned into a Christian space</strong>.</p>
<p>This was turned into the <strong>Church of Santo Domingo</strong>, named after Saint Dominic, the founder of Dominican order who emphasized conversions. It was built around and on top of the original shrine which was flattened except for one wall.</p>

<p>This symbolized appropriation and supremacy with the Spanish over the Inca and Christianity over the Inca religion. The new building was built in Spanish Baroque style, which was fashionable at the time.</p>

<p>The <strong>Walls at Saqsa Waman </strong>walked down on the city of Cusco from the Northwest. The structure’s zig-zagging walls indicated its use as a fortress.</p>
<p>The <strong>stones </strong>were quarried and hauled into place using huge manpower. These were much larger than those used for streets and houses. This was defensive in function.</p>
<p>Francisco Pizarro was the Spaniard who conquered Inca.</p>
<p>Through his brother there is this description of the site. “<em>On the top of a hill, they had a very strong fort surrounded with masonry walls of stones and having two very high round towers. In the lower part of this wall, there were stones so large and thick that it seemed impossible that human hands could have set them in place. They were so close together and so well fitted that the point of a pin could not have been inserted into one of the joints.”</em></p>
<h5><em> </em><strong>A Background History </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>1438</strong>: the Empire was founded by Pachacuti</li>
<li><strong>1440</strong>: the construction began</li>
<li><strong>1532 – 1535</strong>: Inca were conquered by Francisco Pizarro</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Rituals and Practices </strong></h5>
<p>The most <strong>important rituals and practices</strong> occurred in this capital city. It was considered a<strong> religious space.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Young women</strong> were chosen from across the empire based on their virginity, beauty, nobility, and status to serve as <strong>“chosen women”</strong>. They prepared ritual food, maintained a sacred fire, wove garments for Inca rulers, made corn beer for rituals, served gods in shrines, and were given to Inca royalty or aristocrats in marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Young men</strong> were brought to be educated and raised in Inca culture. They were indoctrinated into Inca culture since the empire was very vast and diverse. They became valuable advocates for Inca traditions.</p>
<h4><strong>Templo Mayor and the City of Cusco.</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>How religion influenced art. The expression of sacred across time and culture.</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>Both <strong>Tenochtitlan</strong> (founded in 1325 on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco) and the <strong>City of Cusco</strong> (11th &#8211; 12th century, rebuilt by Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui (1418–1471/1472) represent carefully planned urban and religious environments. Each is divided into four distinct parts which reflected the cosmos order and the power structures within the Aztec and Inca Empire.</p></blockquote>
<p>The center of both religious precincts consisted of large plazas surrounded by ceremonial platforms. Their main temples, <strong>The Twin Towers of the Templo Mayor</strong> (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City 1375–1520 C.E.) and the <strong>Qorikancha </strong>(Cusco, c. 1440-1540) were considered axis mundi and were positioned at the center of their respective empires. The temples were subdivided between the main gods of each of the cultures. Thus, the north (right) side shrine of the Templo Mayor was associated with the mountain Tonacatepetl, i.e. the “Mountain of Sustenance” dedicated to Tlaloc, the god of rain and the other, on the south (left) side, was associated with the mountain Coatepetl, i.e. the “Serpent Mountain” dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. At its turn Qorikancha contained the temples of Creator god Viracocha, the sun-god Inti, the moon goddess, the god of thunder, and the rainbow god, as well as a magnificent garden sculpted in good and silver, dedicated to the Sun-god.</p>
<p>The Qorikancha garden reproduced in precious metals (gold and silver) the variety of plants and animals that grew under the light of the Sun god and allowed the Incas to feed their empire. A special place in the garden was given to the maize. A preserved maize cobs sculpture shows to what extent the Inca metalworkers mimicked life-sized corns on the stalk.</p>
<p>While both temple’s stories were concerned with the <strong>Sun and the Moon</strong> mixing mythology with astronomy, the <strong>Aztec Serpent Mountain</strong> tells a much darker story. The key for deciphering the Temple Major story was the discovery of the Coyolxauhqui monolith, at the base of the stairs of the Serpent Temple. The large monolith, approximately 3.5 meters as diameter and weighing about 8 tones, represents a female deity “Coyolxauhqui, or Bells-on-her-face” carved in low relief. Her body adorned with an exquisite headdress and earrings is dismembered. Her bones are showing off and despite having the attributes of a mother (sagging belly, elongated breasts) she is shown in a humiliating nakedness.</p>
<p>Coyolxauhqui’s myth tells that after realizing that her mother Coatlicue, the earth, is magically pregnant with a new god, she became jealous and convinced her 400 brothers, the stars, to kill their mother. Still in his mother&#8217;s womb, the sun that was to be born perceived the threat and emerged ready for battle. He cut off the moon deity into pieces, which explained why the Moon was divided into quarters in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>The temples also served as ceremonial centers.</strong> At <strong>Templo Major</strong> the ceremonies consisted in the public reenactment of the Coyolxauhqui’s death thrown down the mountain-stairs doubled by a blood and organs sacrifice in the bowl of the chacmool at the base of the Tlaloc side of the temple.</p>
<p>At <strong>Qorikancha</strong> the access to the temples was probably restricted to the Inca rulers., their families and high ranked officials. Only a gold statue represented Inti, as a small, seated boy, like Midday Sun, was brought out into the open air each day and returned in the night. However, 41 sacred sight lines (ceques) radiated as sun rays out of Qorikancha, four of them being the main 4 Inca 2 roads.  Shrines were placed along these lines and different noble families tended to and held rituals at the shrines throughout the year.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Spanish conquistadores affected both Templo Mayor and the Qorikancha Temples of Cuzco in a similar way. The sacred precinct of Templo Mayor was completely buried underneath colonial buildings, behind the cathedral of the City of Mexico, while atop the Qorikancha site the conquistadores built the baroque Catholic Church of Santo Domingo maintaining only the Inca stone foundations. Despite the Spanish chronicles that reflect the admiration for the pre-existing Inca and Aztec temples, their destruction was carried out as a physical expression of a spiritual and political conquest.</p></blockquote>
<p>This large-scale destruction can be understood in the context of the 1492 Spanish Reconquista, an event preceding the voyages of conquistadores. The Christian Spanish people fought with the Saracen kingdoms expulsing the Muslims and the Jews from Spain. In the reconquered territories the mosques (ex. Cordoba) were transformed into churches.</p>

<p><strong><em>Maize cobs </em></strong>is a work made from <strong>sheet metal/repoussée, gold and silver. </strong>The vegetable replica<strong> measures 10 inches long.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Repoussé is a </strong>French  word meaning “to push back”.  It is a type of sculptural technique where the <strong>metal is beaten from the inside</strong> to leave raised designs on the surface.</p>
<p>Here, Inca metalsmiths expertly combined silver and copper to mimic the internal and external components of actual corn. Inca were known for their metalwork practice. They excelled at it. <strong>Silver metal </strong>was used for the corn. <strong>Gold metal </strong>was used for the husk. The life-sized husks are naturalistic in design.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Maize cobs</em></strong> would have been in the <strong>Inca sculpture garden</strong> outside of the Temple of Qorikancha. The garden was used three times a year for rituals related to sowing and harvesting maize. All of these objects acted as a display of the Inti (sun god’s) power, as well as an offering of thanks.</p>
<h5><strong>The Art of Corn</strong></h5>
<p>This work illustrates the <strong>ripe ear of corn</strong> breaking through its husk. It is still on the stalk but ready to be harvested.  Individual kernels protrude.</p>
<h5><strong>This Work in Context</strong></h5>
<p>The garden contained <strong>sculpted llamas, corn, flowers, and people</strong>. All were life size, and all were made from gold and silver metal. The garden essentially became a narrative that the Inca empire told about themselves. It Illustrated their piety but also all the riches of the empire</p>
<p><strong>After the Spaniards arrived in the Andes, the European invaders soon desired Inca gold and silver.</strong></p>

<p>Some of the earliest Spanish chroniclers record the placement of a huge sculpture garden outside the Qorikancha. These Inca objects were looted in large quantities, and many were sent back to Spain. <strong><em>Maize cobs</em></strong> might have ended up as a gift to HRE Charles V. By 1534, his court records mention a gold maize stalk with three leaves and two ears of corn.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Maize is corn that is blue or red but not yellow.</strong> It also represents the most important crop to the Inca. It was used for food, beer, and clothing.</p>

<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu </strong>is in the<strong> Central highlands of Peru. </strong>Made of<strong> granite </strong>it measures roughly<strong> 530 by 200 meters. </strong>Sitting on a sacred mountain 8000 feet up, it overlooks the Urubamba River.</p>
<p>The granite was left unpainted and fitted with<strong> stone masonry</strong> techniques. Most structures were roofed with wood and thatch with straw and reeds.</p>
<p>There was <strong>one doorway/gate</strong> to access the site. This controlled movement and the view.</p>
<p><strong>Terraces</strong> or flat gardens cut into the mountain side, were a common element of the Inca. This Increased arable land surface and allowed the Inca to be agricultural, even though there was no flat arable farmland available.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu </strong>was built as a royal estate for the first Inka emperor, Pachacuti. The emperor only lived here for a maximum of six months per year. It was intended as a place where the Inca could entertain, perform religious ceremonies, and administer the empire.</p>
<p>The city represented an expression of power and status.</p>
<p>The ability to command people across the empire to construct this was an expression of  the emperor’s power.  The modification of the landscape by shaving the off top of  the mountain, as well as the prediction of the sun, indicated he controlled nature. This legitimized his claim to the throne.</p>
<p>The site contained over 200 buildings in total with <strong>housing for elites, army, and staff. </strong>There were <strong>religious shrines, fountains, baths, astronomies, </strong>and<strong> terraces</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the <strong>high-status residential buildings</strong> are in a cluster to the Northeast (right-hand side of main image). The <strong>royal section</strong> was separated on the Southwest side (the left-hand side of main image).</p>

DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini Picture Library/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Observatory is adjacent to the royal residence (towers). It is composed of two main parts: an upper room with windows (likely symbolized the heavens) and a lower room with no windows (likely symbolized the underworld).</p>
<p>The windows in the upper room clearly reveal that they had been moved in the masonry. This may have been to position them to the most accurate placement to frame the summer solstice sunrise.</p>

<p>The term refers to the <strong>“hitching post of the sun”</strong>, as Inti means sun.</p>
<p>The carved boulder is in the ritual area of the site to the west of the main plaza. The stone’s name refers to the idea that it was used to track the passage of the sun throughout the year. Again, if the Inca ruler claimed to be a descendant of the sun, and he could track the sun, it would legitimize his claims that he had the right to rule.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Points</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Not even excavated until 1911</li>
<li>Location was approximately a three days’ walk from the Inca capital of Cusco</li>
<li>Graves found on the site reveal a huge variety of people who lived and worked here.</li>
<li>Inca rulers claimed to be descendants of the sun and therefore, they were considered gods on earth.</li>

<p><strong>All-T’oqapu tunic </strong>is made from<strong> camelid fiber and cotton. </strong>It measures<strong> 3 by 2.5 feet. </strong>Weaving was usually done with a series of sturdy sticks upon which the <strong>warp</strong> (skeletal threads of the textile) was woven. There are 100 threads per centimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton </strong>grew well in the empire along the coast. It was made into a variety of colors.</p>
<p><strong>Camelids</strong> (remember Camelid sacrum?) thrived in the highlands (llamas and alpaca are camelids)</p>
<p>These animal fibers are dyed more easily than plant fibers. Dyes used included cochineal red that comes from the bodies of small insects that live on cactus. It takes thousands to make even just a small amount of dye. Another color is indigo blue which comes from a flower. Both dyes are extremely expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting, spinning, and dyeing fibers for a textile</strong> represented a huge amount of work. This as well as weaving was completed by women.</p>

<p>It was traditional to try to make a <strong>t’oqapu</strong> tunic in one single piece if possible. This would indicate the skill of the weaver and would avoid cutting the cloth, which was believed to damage its spiritual power.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Symbolizes the power/status of an Inca ruler</li>
<li>Social power: signifies ruler’s ability to command empire to produce this; chosen women sew</li>
<li>Political power: signifies one ruler’s control over this vast territory</li>
<li>Cultural power: signifies one ruler’s unification of these various clans and tribes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Military power: one of the t’oqapu (black and white checkerboard pattern) symbolizes the Inca military; shows that the army is an extension of the Inca ruler</li>
<li>Material power: control of resources and statement of the wealth of the Inca empire (expensive dyes, vast amounts of fabric)</li>
<li>Religious power: ruler is dressed like Vairococha (based on creation myth)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>T’oqapu</strong>: square geometric motifs that symbolize a particular noble family/clan/group (similar to a European family crest)</li>
<li><strong>T’oqapu tunics</strong> are only allowed to be worn by those of high rank</li>
<li>An <strong>all-t’oqapu</strong> is only allowed to be worn by a ruler.</li>
<li>It is a single piece of cloth, woven with slit in the center for the head to pass through (just like a poncho) with “sleeves” sewn along the side to close it up.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Refers to an important Inca creation myth Viracocha (god) after creating humans sent out all the different peoples with their ethnic patterns painted on their bodies to keep order over them</li>
<li>Textiles were the other major Inca artistic production (as well as metal work)</li>
<li>Textiles were produced by “chosen women” who were collected across the empire for their virginity, beauty, and status to weave fine cloth.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Post-Columbian Art: Influenced by the Europeans</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>European exploration</strong> and settlement of North, Central, and South America <strong>had a significant impact on the indigenous cultures, artwork, and architecture</strong>. When the Spanish conquerors entered the Mexica Empire and Tenochtitlan, they were amazed at the richness and beauty of the land. However, when they experienced the priests in the midst of bloodletting rituals and idol worship and covered in blood, they regarded the culture as a repulsive cult. They <strong>destroyed the religious symbols and illustrated books and tore down images of deities</strong>. Missionaries suppressed local beliefs and practices and worked to spread Christianity throughout the Americas.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Incan Empire</strong>, smallpox killed much of the population, including the emperor. Treasures like the <strong><em>Maize cobs</em></strong> that adorned an ornamental garden outside the Coricancha were taken back to Spain and melted down.</p>

<p>The Coricancha itself was stripped of its riches, consecrated as a Christian building, and the church of Santo Domingo built on top of it. These actions have made stratigraphic archaeology impossible, and archaeologists must rely on written ethnohistoric documents to help give cultural context to artworks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frontispiece of the</em></strong> <strong><em>Codex</em></strong> <strong><em>Mendoza </em></strong>is a <strong>manuscript book </strong>created with <strong>pigment on paper.</strong> The artists were indigenous and made these illustrations, in various styles, under the supervision of missionary priests. The Images were annotated in Spanish, by a priest that spoke Nahuatl.</p>
<p>There is no recession, or modeling, and the figures are stylized. There is a hierarchical scale, in that the Aztecs are larger than others figures. There is no correct proportion or scale.</p>
<h5><strong>Why the Codex was Made</strong></h5>
<p>In 1541, the first viceroy of New Spain , Antonio Mendoza, commissioned this <strong>codex</strong> to record information about the <strong>Aztec Empire</strong>. It was educational to aid him in understanding his new Aztec subjects and history of the region. It was also supposed to be a gift to HRE Charles V, to encourage him to fund exploration and show him more about the empire.</p>

<p>A <strong>frontispiece</strong> is an illustration facing the title page of a book. The book contains a chronological and detailed history of Mexico City, especially of the founders and rulers. This included information about the organization and foundation of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. A summary of tributes given by 33 provinces to the Aztecs is also in the book.</p>
<p>The work is insightful as it shows everyday lives of Aztecs from birth to death. Part of the book contained indigenous manuscripts and stories.</p>
<h5><strong>European Meets Aztec</strong></h5>
<p>The book format is European influenced. It has a linear organization that creates a clear historical order. Each page is one idea or subject, as per the European desire for order and categorize.</p>
<p>The Aztec influence illustrates the settlement of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec conquest and Aztec defeat all in one. This was common to depict multiple scenes or narratives in one image.</p>
<h5><strong>The Image</strong></h5>
<p>This shows the diagram of Tenochtitlan, with the city <strong>divided into four parts</strong>, representing the actual four canals that divided the city. The Aztecs believed the world was divided into four eras and four regions – north, south, east, west&#8211; with the Aztecs at the center.</p>
<p>In the <strong>center is an eagle on a cactus</strong>, growing from a rock.  The simple structure above the eagle symbolizes the Templo Mayor. This would have been at the center of the city. Below the cactus and stone is a war shield, indicating the Aztecs had to conquer this land.</p>
<p>Different types of plants, especially maize, dot the city’s four quadrants. This references the agricultural fertility associated with the city. Ten men are depicted in the four quadrants, wearing white garments and top knots. These are the leaders of the ten clans that comprised the Aztecs, who led the people to the island. Their name glyphs are attached to them.</p>
<p>On <strong>the left triangle at point</strong> is a priest with a red ear and ash colored skin. This is a symbol of ritual bloodletting. In the <strong>register at the bottom</strong> are two scenes of military conquest of the early Aztec settlements.</p>
<p><strong>On the border</strong> glyphs are used that indicate years. The one with a dagger above it indicated the  first year of the new 52-year cycle,  at the start of which human sacrifice must occur. Glyphs indicate years through which Spanish takeover happened.</p>
<h5><strong>A Historical View</strong></h5>
<p>Tenochtitlan was established in the middle of Lake Texcoco, in the Valley of Mexico,  in 1325. According to Aztec myth, the patron deity Huitzilopochtli told the Aztecs to leave their ancestral home and look for a place where they saw an eagle, atop a cactus, growing from a rock. That was where they should settle and build a city.</p>
<p>Aztecs were conquered by Spanish in 1519-1521. Viceroyalty of New Spain was established.</p>
<p>Viceroy Antonio Mendoza intended to send the codex to the Spanish king HRE Charles V. While the book was on a Spanish ship to Spain, French pirates captured the ship and took the goods on board. The codex ended up in France,  where it was sold. It was acquired by Andre Thevet, the cosmographer to King Henry II of France. Thevet wrote his name on several pages.</p>

<h4><strong>Native North American Art </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Native</strong> <strong>North</strong> <strong>America</strong> denotes traditionally oriented cultures <strong>north</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>United</strong> <strong>States–Mexico</strong> <strong>border</strong> from ancient times to the present, with an emphasis on the period from 1492 century to today. Native North America has many regional subunits, such as the <strong>Northwest</strong> <strong>Coast, </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Southwest,</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Plains,</strong> <strong>and</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Eastern</strong> <strong>Woodlands.  </strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1386" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Native-North-American-Art-Map.png?resize=795%2C534&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="795" height="534" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Native-North-American-Art-Map.png?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Native-North-American-Art-Map.png?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The various Native American groups may be seen to share larger ideas of <strong>harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership</strong>, and <strong>participation in large rituals</strong>, such as <strong>potlatches</strong> and <strong>sun dances.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-contact art</strong> not only reflects these long- standing values, but it is also concerned with the history of conflict within tribes and between indigenous people and the U.S. and Canadian governments.</p>
<p>Indians, Native Americans, North American Indians (in the United States), and First Nations (in Canada) are nonindigenous terms for the indigenous peoples. These people were inhabiting areas north of what is now the United States– Mexico border, from ancient times to the present. They did not have a collective name for themselves, being many different tribes and nations.</p>

<p><strong>Great Serpent Mound</strong> is an earthwork/effigy mound located in <strong>Adams County, southern Ohio</strong>. It measures <strong>1,348 feet long and 3 feet tall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Earthwork</strong> refers to mounds that are deliberately made into <strong>decorative</strong> or representational shapes and <strong>made of earth</strong>. The head is at the northeast. The tail is roughly located in the southwest. There are seven winding coils in between.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Essentially, we are looking at a Native American version of Stonehenge. The head aligns with the summer solstice sunset or longest day of the year. Tail points to the winter solstice sunrise or shortest day of the year. The curves of the body parallel lunar phases.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was used to mark time or seasons. Maybe it was made to indicate when to plant and when to harvest. It also may have been used as a kind of compass in alignment with the Pole Star.</p>
<p>The size is significant and must have had some desire to impress or amaze. Consider other large works like <em>Bayeux Tapestry</em>, <em>Night Attack at Sanjo Palace</em>, <em>Trajan’s column</em>. The size shows time, intricacy, power, supremacy.</p>
<p>There were <strong>no burials here</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This one depicts a serpent. Others are smaller but depict bears and deer. <strong>Great Serpent Mound</strong> is the largest serpent sculpture in the world.</p>
<p>The curled snake that has either an open mouth with wide jaw about to eat an egg, or a large, stylized eye. The egg by the head of the serpent is perhaps a representation of the sun. This might also symbolize a solar eclipse (eating the sun). The Shape of the serpent symbolizes the constellation Draco.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Agriculture in the Midwest US region led to a population boom. Numerous mounds were made by Native American cultures who lived here. Many were destroyed as white American settlers expanded and Native Americans here did not have written records.</p>
<p>Baffled archaeologists point out the total shape can only be gathered from the air or a high vantage point, neither of which the Indians would have possessed. How exactly would Natives have appreciated it? Why make it so big?</p>
<p>Many native cultures in this region attributed supernatural powers to snakes or reptiles.</p>

Site-specific</p>
<p><strong>Mesa Verde cliff dwellings </strong>located in<strong> Montezuma County, Colorado</strong>, are built into the side of a cliff and are made from <strong>sandstone </strong>from the canyon. Stone and mud mortar,  along with wooden beams were used to help raise multiple stories.</p>
<p>These are not the only cliff dwellings but <strong>the best-preserved examples of cliff dwellings.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>These cliff dwellings were used as a <strong>domestic space and civic spaces</strong> or residential dwelling that were used for storage and ritual.  They generally housed between 125 to 250 people.</p>
<p><strong>Clans lived together for defence and support</strong>. Having homes set under the side of the cliff provided protection from sun and snow.</p>
<h5><strong>The Set Up</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1385" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/154-Additional-Picture.jpg?resize=397%2C528&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="397" height="528" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/154-Additional-Picture.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/154-Additional-Picture.jpg?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Cliff dwellings were known as <strong>pueblos</strong> (communal villages of flat-roofed structures that are made of stacked stone). <strong>Each family had one room</strong> and there were about 150 in total.</p>
<p>Some pueblos were <strong>five to six stories tall.</strong> The <strong>top houses stored supplies</strong>. Here it was cool, dry, out of the way, and only accessible by ladders.</p>
<p><strong>Kivas</strong> or rounded and sunken rooms, with wood-beamed roofs,  were  situated across the site. There were 20 in total. These were meeting rooms for <strong>civic and religious gatherings.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ancestral Puebloans</strong> occupied this region from about 450 CE to 1300 CE.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The dates that <strong>AP provides</strong> are the dates for which the Anasazi (tribe) occupied this area, NOT the dates of the construction of the site.</p>
<p>These communities were comprised of sedentary <strong>farmers </strong>who cultivated beans, squash, and corn.</p>
<p>From 450 – 1200s, farmers lived above the canyon and lived near their crops.</p>
<p>By the 13<sup>th</sup> century things changed. Farmers moved into the canyons and began to construct pueblos. This made things difficult as food and water had to be transported into the canyon, as the fields were now many miles away.</p>
<p><strong>Why did they move? </strong>Did the cliffs provide protection from invaders? Did the canyon provide ceremonial or spiritual significance? Did the canyon provide significant protection from environmental elements?</p>
<p>The <strong>cliffs were eventually abandoned</strong> in 1300 CE. It is not clear as to why. Was there drought? A lack of resources, or violence? Or some combination?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>European Influence on Native American Art</h4>
<p>In <strong>Native North America</strong>, experts believe that almost 90 percent of the indigenous population died from illnesses introduced by Europeans.</p>
<p>Many groups traded war prisoners as slaves, and the introduction of European materials influenced how the indigenous cultures lived and the artwork they produced. European influence affected the content and materials of the Native North Americans to the point that what is now considered traditional is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Centuries of interaction with colonial and migrant peoples means that <strong>some imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon are now considered traditional</strong>. Likewise, in subject matter, the <strong>Spanish-introduced horse</strong> has become a cultural and artistic staple, <strong>alongside the indigenous buffalo, raven, and bear.</strong></p>
<p>Archaeologists must rely on alternative sources of information for Native North American art, including oral and written tribal history, written ethnohistoric documents, modern artists&#8217; accounts and interviews, and museum records. Historical sources may be inaccurate depending on whether native or European sources are used.</p>
<p>European influence is inevitable but may be subtle. What is considered traditional is constantly changing. There is no singular, timeless, authentic Native American art, or practice.</p>

<p><strong>Bandolier bag</strong> is a crafted bag made with <strong>beadwork on leather</strong>. It measures <strong>2 feet by 1 foot and 6 inches</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thousands of tiny beads were strung together and then sewn onto the bag. <strong>These glass beads are known as seed beads</strong> and are prized for their brilliant color and tiny form.</p>
<p>The bag is also <strong>decorated with silk ribbons</strong> in yellow, blue, red, green, and orange. Each are various lengths.</p>
<p><strong>A thick strap</strong> crossing from one edge of the bag to the other side allows it to rest over a person’s shoulder and sit on the hip</p>

<h5><strong>Notes of Interest</strong></h5>
<p>Each bag is unique, often large in size and decorated with a wide array of colorful beads and ribbons. The contrasting colors might symbolize sky versus the underworld. The four-pronged/pointed flowers or stars might indicate the four cardinal directions and a connection to the earth.</p>
<p>The Prairie Style uses colorful glass seed beads to make floral patterns.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Due to the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), many tribes were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to Oklahoma and Wisconsin.
<ul>
<li>Lenape were one of those tribes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tribes continued to create these bags however they were exposed to a variety of other Native American tribes that were not familiar with this art. A diffusion of design and style called Prairie Style evolved post 1830s (Midwest tribes: floral designs + Eastern tribes: seed beads and bags)</li>
<li>Women created these bags.</li>
<li>Cross-cultural influence: not only did the shape and style of bag come from Europeans, but the seed beads and silk ribbons were acquired from European traders.
<ul>
<li>Native Americans had never seen glass or brilliant color the way they saw them in the beads or ribbon.</li>
<li>Native Americans often traded land for beads/ribbons.</li>
<li>Europeans thought beads/ribbons were cheap and that they were getting better end of the deal.</li>

<p>The<strong> <em>Transformation mask </em></strong>made by<strong> the Kwakwaka’wakw, </strong>in the<strong> Northwest coast of Canada </strong>is designed from<strong> wood, paint, and string. </strong>The wood chosen was <strong>red cedar</strong>, which was readily available, dense, and strong. The <strong>red </strong>color was linked to salmon, blood, sun, and fire, which were all considered sacred. <strong>Traditional colors also included black, white, and green.</strong></p>
<p>This work was created prior to European contact and carved using hand tools and natural pigments. After European contact, practices changed. Masks were then carved using metal tools. Brighter and synthetic colors were introduced.</p>
<p>The style is referred to as <strong>formline</strong>. The word formline was coined in 1965 to describe the Northwest Coast visual culture. <strong>Masks</strong>, whether opened or closed, were <strong>bilaterally symmetrical</strong>. Here, there is a use of <strong>undulating, calligraphic black line </strong>and the eyes are ovoid shapes.</p>
<h5><strong>How was this Mask Used?</strong></h5>
<p>Masks were worn at <strong>potlatch </strong>or dance/ceremonies, which were performed by firelight and were used for special occasions to show birth, initiation, marriage, and death. They also aided to honor or interact with ancestors or spiritual beings as a <strong>totem</strong> or connection.</p>
<p>At the end of the dance, the mask was opened and it transforms into a different animal. During the potlatch, the dancer is transformed into the spirit represented on the mask.</p>

<p><strong>Masks were part of story telling and were used to re-enact myths describing human origins</strong>. Humans were animals who shed their skins and danced to reveal human form. Only men who were initiated into the tribes could wear the mask.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1390" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/164-Dance.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" />Masks also were a show of social rank and a mark of status by asserting relationships with the spirit world. These objects also displayed the importance of a family or clan and were given as gifts to show wealth and high status.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Transformation mask, </em></strong>would have been worn with a red cedar bark cloak. Masks were personal to the wearer and the wearer’s family. Figures depicted on them represent the dancer’s ancestral/spiritual counterparts</p>

<p><strong><em>Painted elk hide</em></strong> is a work <strong>attributed to Cotsiogo (Cadzi Cody) from the Eastern Shoshone, Wind River Reservation, Wyoming</strong>.  It is made from <strong>painted elk hide.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Cotsiogo (co SEE ko)</strong></p>
<p>In Native American art elk, deer and buffalo hides were traditionally used to minimize the waste of animals by using all the parts. Natural pigments were used such as red ochre or chalk. Any used synthetic paints and dyes were obtained from Euro-Americans.</p>
<p>The Imagery was done with <strong>free-hand painting and some stenciling. </strong>There is a sense of flattened and negative space. The work is stylized and in simple form with no modeling.</p>
<h5><strong>Multipurpose Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Creations such as<strong> <em>Painted elk hide </em></strong>were made for wall hangings and for robes, as well as being a sign of status.  Hide paintings were traditional artworks for Plains Indians and depicted religious scenes, major events, tribal designs, or affiliations. The content would change depending on the audience.</p>
<p>Later these works were created for those interested in Native culture and life as well as tourists. Popular themes for these buyers include buffalo hunts, as well as Native Americans on horseback and in teepees.</p>
<p>Artmaking for Native Americans is a way of keeping traditions alive.</p>
<h5><strong>Scenes of Celebration and Daily Life</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Three Dances </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sun Dance</strong> is an important, <strong>sacred dance</strong>. It surrounds a not-yet-raised buffalo head between two poles with an eagle above it. Dancers dance around the pole as a celebration of the renewal of life, earth, and people. It honors the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>Grass Dance</strong> involves men dancing around poles to bless the land.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf Dance</strong> is <strong>a non-religious dance that celebrates warriors</strong> on horses returning to camp. It is about the power and prestige of warriors.</p>
<p><strong>Scenes of daily life are shown</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Women rest near a fire</li>
<li>Men hunt for buffalo and some wear feathered war bonnets to depict bravery.</li>
<li>Two teepees represent the camp</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>The hide depicts past events and vibrancy of Native American life, rather than current reality. It shows them <strong>hunting with bows and arrows</strong>, but by the time this art was created, <strong>they used rifles</strong>, introduced by Euro-Americans. Additionally, Native Americans didn’t live out in plains, but they lived on reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Horses</strong> are not native to North America. They had been introduced by the Spaniards and arrived in the Midwest via trade.</p>
<p><strong>Buffalo</strong> were sacred. By the time Cotsiogo painted this, they had almost been entirely killed off.</p>
<p>Sadly, the <strong>Sun Dance</strong> had been outlawed by the US Government to compel the Native Americans to abandon their traditional ways.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1391" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/165-Artist.jpg?resize=406%2C377&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="406" height="377" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/165-Artist.jpg?w=406&amp;ssl=1 406w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/165-Artist.jpg?resize=300%2C279&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>During his life <strong>Cotsiogo (1866-1912)</strong> was placed on the Wind River Reservation. He was the son of Washakie, a renowned Shoshane leader. As one of the first commercial artists among his tribe. He enjoyed artistic pursuits as they satisfied his curiosity.</p>
<p>Although the Sun Dance was outlawed at the time, he likely added the images because he knew it was a subject that tourists were interested in. Yet, he modified it to include the Wolf Dance to avoid ramifications.</p>

<p><strong><em>Black on black ceramic vessel</em></strong> crafted by <strong>Maria Martinez and Julian Martinez</strong> was created in <strong>Tewa, Puebloan, and San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico. </strong></p>
<p>All raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully so the vessel could be fired properly.</p>
<p>They pioneered a style of <strong>applying a matte-black design over polished-black</strong>. By doing this they were able to recreate what ancestors had done before them.</p>
<h5><strong>Making This Work</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Take local iron rich clay</li>
<li>Mix with powder from shards of broken pots + volcanic ash + water</li>
<li>Make shape of pot by hand, without a potter’s wheel</li>
<li>Dry vessel</li>
<li>Scrape, sand, smooth</li>
<li>Cover with slip (clay + water)</li>
<li>Slip is polished by rubbing a smooth stone over the surface to flatten the clay and create a shiny finish. A difficult and time-consuming process.</li>
<li>Pot was painted with designs with an iron-rich solution by using iron ore or guaco, which is a wild plant.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Firing Process</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pots were dried, then <strong>fired at high temperatures</strong> to change brittle clay to ceramics</li>
<li>No kilns used, but fire was hot enough it could be made with manure</li>
<li>Smothering the fire with powdered manure during the firing removed the oxygen while retaining the heat and this resulted in a pot that was blackened with areas without slip turning shiny black, and areas with slip turning matte black</li>
<li>Achieving the <strong>deepest shades of black required about six firings.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created to <strong>revive traditions</strong> of Puebloan pottery making in New Mexico. This also helped to <strong>reframe Native pottery as fine art</strong>, instead of promoting it as utilitarian. To aide this, she began to <strong>sign her name</strong> on the bottom of the pots. This made her name the brand, but it also denied the communal nature of the pot. However, she began to make more money per pot.</p>
<p>The buyers were those that had interest in <strong>Native art</strong>, mainly white Americans. Soon, she began to sell the pots to major art galleries.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>San Ildefonso</strong> <strong>style</strong>: based on 12<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup> century Puebloan ceramic shards (based on Neolithic designs) that had recently been discovered in excavations</li>
<li>Two design registers: one across the shoulder/body and one across the neck</li>
<li>Elements are abstract, but are probably depicting natural motifs</li>
<li>Shape, color, and design match the contemporary and geometric Art Deco movement, popular between the two WWs</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Before the arrival of the railroad to this area in the 1880s, pots were used for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. When inexpensive pots appeared along the railroad, Native practices declined. The introduction of tin and metal meant cheaper, easier to make, sturdier pots.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artists</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1392" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/166-artist.jpg?resize=400%2C528&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="528" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/166-artist.jpg?w=229&amp;ssl=1 229w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/166-artist.jpg?resize=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1 227w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Maria Martinez</strong> is one of the best-known Native potters in part due to her connections with a larger, non-Native audience. She lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso from 1887 to 1980. This is located 20 miles north of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>She spoke Tewa, the language of the Pueblo culture. Martinez learned the ceramic techniques by watching potters from San Ildefonso. Also, she and her husband Julian were present at the excavations in their community. They drew designs that they found on pottery shards.</p>
<p>Making pottery had traditionally been a communal activity, where different steps in the process were shared. <strong>Maria</strong> formed the vessels by hand. Julian would decorate and paint the pots.</p>
<p>Traditionally, because making pots were communal, they were never signed.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1050" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/155-Structure-40.jpg?resize=990%2C653&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="653" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/155-Structure-40.jpg?w=444&amp;ssl=1 444w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/155-Structure-40.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 5.4 Theories and Interpretations of Indigenous American Art</strong></h5>
<p>Despite underlying similarities, there are key differences between the art of ancient America and Native North America with respect to its dating, environment, cultural continuity from antiquity to the present, and sources of information.</p>
<p>Colonization by different European groups (Catholic and Protestant) undergirds distinct modern political situations for Amerindian survivors. Persecution, genocide, and marginalization have shaped current identity and artistic expression.</p>
<h5><strong>Reconstructing the Art and Culture of Ancient America</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Archaeological excavation</strong> of works of art, monuments, and cities/sites predating European invasion serves as the mainstay for reconstructing the art and culture of ancient America, although most surviving artworks were not scientifically extracted.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish chronicles</strong> by invaders, friars, and colonists provide some information about monuments and artistic practices of the last independent indigenous peoples, such as the Inka, Mexica (also known as Aztecs), and Puebloans. These sources can be cautiously applied to earlier cultures’ basic values and approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Hieroglyphs</strong> of the Mayas and Mexica illuminate text and image, and historical and artistic elements of those cultures. Ethnographic analogy highlights basic cultural continuities so that present traditional practices, myths, and religious beliefs may illuminate past artistic materials, creative processes, and iconography. Other disciplines, such as astronomy, botany, and zoology, help identify siting of cities and monuments, as well as native flora and fauna subject matter. Like all art historical research, work in these areas uses <strong>iconographic and formal analyses of large numbers of artworks</strong> and increasingly employs multidisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<h5><strong>Native North American Sources</strong></h5>
<p>Sources of information for Native North American art include <strong>archaeological excavations</strong> for precontact and colonial cultures, <strong>written ethnohistoric documents</strong>, <strong>tribal history</strong>, (both oral and written), modern artists’ <strong>accounts and interviews</strong>, and <strong>museum records</strong>.</p>
<p>Colonial and modern mistreatment of Native North Americans means that historical information sources may be highly contested. Divergent stories depend on whether native or non-native sources are used. Sometimes the stories converge in a positive way, as in Maria and Julian Martinez’s revival of ancient black-on-black ceramic techniques, which was encouraged by anthropologists.</p>

Site-specific</p>
<p><strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> is a <strong>stone</strong> (complex) in the <strong>Andean highlands of Peru</strong> and sits at an <strong>elevation of 10,330 feet. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The site is important for three reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It sits between eastern and western ranges of the Andes where the landscape moves from desert/beach to jungle, and it is seen as an important zone of transition.</li>
<li>Located near the confluence of two rivers (Huachesca and Mosna) it is considered a spiritually powerful phenomenon.</li>
<li>Also, as one of the most elevated sites it is closer to the divine.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The temple complex is comprised of two buildings:</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>U-shaped Old Temple </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open to the east, where the sun rises</li>
<li>Interior of temple was full of tunnels, called galleries</li>
<li>Tunnels all existed in total darkness: no windows</li>
<li>Many smaller tunnels acted as air passageways</li>
<li>Tunnels, being made of stone, had perfect acoustics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rectangular New Temple </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Also has a rectangular sunken court</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The temple site is <strong>dedicated to Lanzon god</strong>. This god ensured the harvest, fertility, and abundance was represented in the form of a stele. Lanzon was also known as the smiling god and is often represented smiling.</p>
<p>The temple became <strong>a significant pilgrimage</strong> site across the Chavin empire. The cultural effect of this pilgrimage site was that it became a melting pot of cultures, languages, and art forms. People from all over brought their styles to this site.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 (Lanzon Stela)</strong></h5>

<p><strong> </strong>Lanzon god is represented in the form of a stela. The notched shape wedge is over 15 feet tall.</p>
<p>Illustrated as a human-feline hybrid with eyes gazing upward, it has a feline mouth with great fangs.</p>
<p>The <strong>left arm</strong> is down, while the <strong>right arm</strong> raises up with claw-like nails. <strong>Fangs and talons </strong>are associated with the jaguar – the top predator in the Andes. <strong>Eyebrows and hair</strong> of the figure are rendered as snakes in reference to the passage of time.</p>
<p>This work depicts the Lanzon god using <strong>contour rivalry. </strong>This is a representational form that uses a complex and deliberately visually confusing style allowing the viewers to see what is there&#8212; only if they know what to look for! This creates a barrier between believers who can see the true form and those who cannot.</p>
<p>The technique uses two images with shared parts or outlines. This was a common technique to delineate “true followers” from the masses.</p>
<p>Located deep within the Old Temple tunnels at the intersection of several galleries, this might have been erected before the building and then the building was built around it.</p>
<p>It is built between the ceiling and floor as to indicate its role as conduit between heaven and earth.</p>
<p><strong>Lanzon means “great spear” or “great blade” in Spanish</strong>. This is a reference to the stone’s shape but also the shape of a digging stick used in traditional highland agriculture. No one knows the specifics of the rituals that unfolded in this site.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>The <strong>serpent motif</strong> is a common form of decoration across the site.</p>
<p>A <strong>nose ornament</strong> pinches or passes through the septum. This one is a clip on. Once on the nose the snakes lay on the cheeks. It was worn to indicate wealth, religion, and affiliation with the Lanzon cult.</p>
<p><strong>Metallurgy</strong> is a main art form of the Chavin.  The gold is formed by hammering and cutting. Gold was believed to transform the wearer. It was considered spiritually powerful. Elite men and women were buried with these.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Chavin</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Chavin </strong>were a pre-Inca civilization <strong>along the Andes in South America</strong>. They lived in a very diverse, large area of the Andes.</p>
<p>The Chavin were very skilled in metallurgy and in particular, gold.  Animals were often depicted into the imagery of deities.</p>

Site-specific</p>
<p><strong>Great Serpent Mound</strong> is an earthwork/effigy mound located in <strong>Adams County, southern Ohio</strong>. It measures <strong>1,348 feet long and 3 feet tall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Earthwork</strong> refers to mounds that are deliberately made into <strong>decorative</strong> or representational shapes and <strong>made of earth</strong>. The head is at the northeast. The tail is roughly located in the southwest. There are seven winding coils in between.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Essentially, we are looking at a Native American version of Stonehenge. The head aligns with the summer solstice sunset or longest day of the year. Tail points to the winter solstice sunrise or shortest day of the year. The curves of the body parallel lunar phases.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was used to mark time or seasons. Maybe it was made to indicate when to plant and when to harvest. It also may have been used as a kind of compass in alignment with the Pole Star.</p>
<p>The size is significant and must have had some desire to impress or amaze. Consider other large works like <em>Bayeux Tapestry</em>, <em>Night Attack at Sanjo Palace</em>, <em>Trajan’s column</em>. The size shows time, intricacy, power, supremacy.</p>
<p>There were <strong>no burials here</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This one depicts a serpent. Others are smaller but depict bears and deer. <strong>Great Serpent Mound</strong> is the largest serpent sculpture in the world.</p>
<p>The curled snake that has either an open mouth with wide jaw about to eat an egg, or a large, stylized eye. The egg by the head of the serpent is perhaps a representation of the sun. This might also symbolize a solar eclipse (eating the sun). The Shape of the serpent symbolizes the constellation Draco.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Agriculture in the Midwest US region led to a population boom. Numerous mounds were made by Native American cultures who lived here. Many were destroyed as white American settlers expanded and Native Americans here did not have written records.</p>
<p>Baffled archaeologists point out the total shape can only be gathered from the air or a high vantage point, neither of which the Indians would have possessed. How exactly would Natives have appreciated it? Why make it so big?</p>
<p>Many native cultures in this region attributed supernatural powers to snakes or reptiles.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 5.3 Purpose and Audience in Indigenous American Art </strong></h5>
<p>What is called “art” is considered to have, contain, and transfer life force rather than simply represent an image. Art requires participation not passive viewing.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mayan Artists</strong></h5>
<p>Art was produced primarily in workshops, but certain individual artists’ styles have been identified particularly Maya. Some works of art were signed. Artists were typically elite specialists and, among the Maya, the second sons of royalty.</p>
<h5><strong>Their Patrons and Audience</strong></h5>
<p>Rulers were the major, but not the only, patrons. Audiences were both large, for calendrical rituals in plazas, and small, for gatherings of priests and nobles inside small temples atop pyramids. Some audiences were supernatural, such as the elaborate graves considered to be in the underworld.</p>
<h5><strong>Functional Objects as Native American Art</strong></h5>
<p>Many Native American artworks are <strong>ritual objects to wear, carry, or use during special ceremonies</strong> in front of large audiences. Functionality of the object is preferred. The more active a work of art, the more it is believed to contain and transfer life force and power.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Practices</strong></h5>
<p>Artistic practices included <strong>workshops</strong>, <strong>apprentice-master</strong> relationships, and, less often, <strong>solitary art</strong> making. Some arts were a <strong>specialization by gender</strong> such as <strong>women weaving</strong> and <strong>men carving</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Patrons might be the tribal leaders, an elder, or a family member. Audiences mostly were the entire group, though some objects and performances were restricted by their sacred or political nature.</p>
<h5><strong>Intellectual Pursuits</strong></h5>
<p>Intellectual pursuits apparent in artistic expressions include the <strong>observation of astronomy</strong>, creation of <strong>poetry</strong>, <strong>song</strong>, and <strong>dance. </strong>The use of <strong>medicine</strong> for curing and divining is also included here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Templo Mayor (Main Temple)</em></strong> is in<strong> Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City, Mexico).  The main temple is made from stone, </strong>while <strong>volcanic stone </strong>was used to form the<strong> Coyolxauhqui Stone. </strong>Meanwhile,<strong> jadeite </strong>was used to create the<strong> Olmec-style mask </strong>and <strong>basalt for the Calendar Stone.  </strong></p>
<p>The temple is like a ziggurat or stepped mastaba, with a double-wide staircase that leads to a plateau, and two smaller temples on top. It was expanded upon by many different rulers and continually enlarged. This has resulted in a complex system of rooms and chambers on the interior.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was Templo Mayor Built?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Temple Mayor</strong> was built to honor the gods Tlaloc and Huitzilopochli. Tlaloc was the god of water, rain, agriculture, and fertility. The Aztecs created the blue and white Northern temple for this god.  Huitzilopochli was the god of  warfare, fire, sun and sacrifice  and the Southern temple of white and red was build for this god. Together, the gods symbolized “burning water” which connoted warfare.</p>
<p>The structure shows the Aztec belief that they could control and influence the cosmos. The spring and autumn equinox rise between the two temples. <strong>Temple Mayor</strong> was believed to be an axis mundi. It sat on the center of the four quadrants of the empire as a small version of the universe. It illustrated power, piety, and place of worship both daily and otherwise. It was the space where sacrifice occurred.</p>

<p>This circular <strong>stone, carved in low relief</strong>, was <strong>originally painted</strong> and measures <strong>11 feet across</strong>. It represents the daughter of the maternal earth deity. The name means bells-on-her-face (golden bells decorate her cheeks). She is shown naked with sagging breasts and a stretched belly to indicate that she was a mother. She is also shown decapitated and dismembered.</p>
<p><strong>The story is arranged in a pinwheel shape. </strong> Coyol’s mother Coatlicue becomes pregnant.  Coyol is angry and with her 400 brothers, they attack Coatlicue. H emerges fully clothed and armed to defend his mother. He beheads Coyol and throws her body down a great mountain</p>
<p>This Parallels the Aztec cosmos. <strong>Coatlicue (Earth)</strong> gives birth to <strong>H (sun)</strong> who <strong>kills Coyol by slicing her (moon) </strong>while their <strong>siblings (stars)</strong> watch.</p>
<p>This stone is <strong>located at the bottom of the staircase</strong> of the Templo Mayor. By placing this at the bottom, the Aztecs made their temple parallel the mountain. Victims were sacrificed on the top. Then, their bodies were rolled down the staircase to fall atop the Coyol stone and to re-enact this myth. This was a powerful reminder to submit to Aztec authority.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2 Calendar Stone </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_1163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1163" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1163" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/157-Calendar-Stone.jpg?resize=500%2C396&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="396" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/157-Calendar-Stone.jpg?resize=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/157-Calendar-Stone.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1163" class="wp-caption-text">Calendar Stone<br />© AZA/Archive Zabé/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>Calendar Stone</strong> is a round, monolithic, low relief sculptural work that measures <strong>12 feet in diameter and weighs 24 tons</strong>. It would have set on the ground or on a table.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not a calendar</strong>, but rather <strong>it records the cosmos</strong> as the Aztecs saw it. Priests used the calendar stone to <strong>determine sacrificial periods</strong>. It shows the authority, religiosity, and responsibility of the Aztecs to continue the cycle of time by continuing sacrifice.</p>
<p>It may have been the stone Aztec priests sacrificed victims on and placed in front of Huitzilopochli’s temple. In the Aztec creation story the gods called for human blood to repay the debt to the gods who sacrificed themselves to create humans. Therefore, human sacrifice was needed. The Aztecs had a cyclical world view in that time repeated and started over. The way to move forward was with sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the center we see Tlaltecuhtli the devouring earth god or Tonatiuh the sun god. The god is wearing earrings. The tongue is a sacrificial blade, and the hands hold a human heart.</p>
<p>Around the image is a sun shape that moves outward. The largest ray of sun points towards the cardinal directions. This is surrounded by a ring of 20 days – the basic unit of the Aztec calendar.</p>
<p>The cosmos was divided into four quadrants. So was Tenochtitlan and Templo Mayor. Other imagery represents different seasonal cycles and representations of gods/goddesses.</p>
<p><strong>Images of various eras</strong></p>

<p>This mask is made from jadeite, which is a hard, green stone. Minerally, it is slightly different than jade.  The mask was not Aztec or made in Central Mexico but made 1,000 years earlier. It was brought here and was found in <strong>Templo Mayor</strong>, indicating its importance.</p>
<p>Art historians have a theory that it was probably worn around the neck during sacrifice and left at the temple for the gods. It was likely made by a group influenced by the Olmecs (Olmecs decline in 250 BCE or so). The Aztecs likely wanted to affiliate themselves with the Olmecs to draw a parallel between a great empire of the past (Olmecs) and a great empire now (Aztecs). This is just like how European kings constantly made associations between themselves and Roman emperors.</p>
<p>Thousands of objects have been found at the <strong>Templo Mayor</strong>. Some offerings demonstrated the Aztec’s awareness of the historical/cultural traditions of Mesoamerica.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>Originally, the city Tenochtitlan was established on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, which is now Mexico City. Between 1519-1521 it was conquered by the Spaniards. Then it was flattened to build Mexico City upon. This was completed as a sign of European supremacy. It was discovered during an excavation in Mexico City in 1978.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong> was a major theme among Aztec religion. There was a belief was that Huitzilopochli needed energy every day to raise the sun. This required daily sacrifice and the priests would ritually eat the heart to symbolize Huitzilopochli’s intake of the sacrifice. This was used for intimidation for enemies.</p>

<p>The<strong> <em>Transformation mask </em></strong>made by<strong> the Kwakwaka’wakw, </strong>in the<strong> Northwest coast of Canada </strong>is designed from<strong> wood, paint, and string. </strong>The wood chosen was <strong>red cedar</strong>, which was readily available, dense, and strong. The <strong>red </strong>color was linked to salmon, blood, sun, and fire, which were all considered sacred. <strong>Traditional colors also included black, white, and green.</strong></p>
<p>This work was created prior to European contact and carved using hand tools and natural pigments. After European contact, practices changed. Masks were then carved using metal tools. Brighter and synthetic colors were introduced.</p>
<p>The style is referred to as <strong>formline</strong>. The word formline was coined in 1965 to describe the Northwest Coast visual culture. <strong>Masks</strong>, whether opened or closed, were <strong>bilaterally symmetrical</strong>. Here, there is a use of <strong>undulating, calligraphic black line </strong>and the eyes are ovoid shapes.</p>
<h5><strong>How was this Mask Used?</strong></h5>
<p>Masks were worn at <strong>potlatch </strong>or dance/ceremonies, which were performed by firelight and were used for special occasions to show birth, initiation, marriage, and death. They also aided to honor or interact with ancestors or spiritual beings as a <strong>totem</strong> or connection.</p>
<p><strong>At the end of the dance</strong>, the mask was opened and it transforms into a different animal. During the potlatch, the dancer is transformed into the spirit represented on the mask.</p>
<p>Masks were <strong>part of story telling</strong> and were used to re-enact myths describing human origins. Humans were animals who shed their skins and danced to reveal human form. Only men who were initiated into the tribes could wear the mask.</p>
<p>Masks also were <strong>a show of social rank</strong> and <strong>a mark of status</strong> by asserting relationships with the spirit world. These objects also displayed the importance of a family or clan and were <strong>given as gifts</strong> to show wealth and high status.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Transformation mask, </em></strong>would have been worn with a red cedar bark cloak. Masks were personal to the wearer and the wearer’s family. Figures depicted on them represent the dancer’s ancestral/spiritual counterparts</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Indigenous Americas</strong></h2>
<h3><strong> 1000 BCE- 1980 CE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1050" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/155-Structure-40.jpg?resize=990%2C653&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="653" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/155-Structure-40.jpg?w=444&amp;ssl=1 444w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/155-Structure-40.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 5.2 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in Indigenous American Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Artistic traditions of the Indigenous Americas exhibit overarching traits and content that emphasizes unity with the natural world. There is a focus on the <strong>five-direction</strong>&#8211;north, south, east, west, and center. <strong>Cosmic geometry</strong> and <strong>spirituality</strong> based in visionary shamanism are other factors. High value is placed on <strong>animal-based</strong> media such as featherwork, bone carving, and hide painting.</p>
<p>Art relies on the incorporation of trade material <strong>greenstones</strong>, such as turquoise and jadeite. It also uses <strong>shells</strong>, such as the spiny oyster. In the case of Native North America, <strong>imported beads</strong>, <strong>machine-made cloth</strong>, and <strong>glazes</strong> are used.  Stylistic focus is on the essence rather than the appearance of subjects. Creation of aesthetic objects that have a strong functional aspect, reference, or utility include vessels, grinding platforms, and pipes.</p>
<h5><strong>In Andean Culture </strong></h5>
<p>The necessity to interact with three disparate environments&#8211;mountains, desert coast, and rainforest&#8211; in order to survive instilled in <strong>Andean culture</strong> and art an underlying emphasis on trade in exotic materials. A hierarchy of materials was based on availability and/ or requirement for collaboration to manipulate the materials.</p>
<p><strong>Featherwork, textiles, and greenstone</strong> were most popular. Textiles were a primary medium and were extraordinarily well preserved on the desert coast, fulfilling key practical and artistic functions in the various environmental zones.</p>
<p><strong>Metalwork, bone, obsidian, and stone</strong> were sometimes employed.  <strong>Ceramics</strong> and <strong>wood</strong> were also sometimes used.</p>
<h5><strong>Mesoamerican Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Mesoamerican pyramids began as early earthworks, changed to nine-level structures with single temples, and then later became structures with twin temples. Sacred sites were renovated and enlarged repeatedly over the centuries, resulting in acropolises and massive temples.</p>
<p>Architecture was mainly <strong>stone post-and-lintel</strong>, often faced with <strong>relief sculpture and painted bright colors</strong>, emphasizing large masses that sculpt outdoor space. Plazas were typical for large ritual gatherings. Elaborate burials and other underground installations to honor the role of the underworld were also found.</p>
<h4><strong>Native American Art</strong></h4>
<p>Native American art media includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earthworks</li>
<li>Stone and adobe architecture</li>
<li>Wood and bone carving</li>
<li>Weaving and basketry</li>
<li>Hide painting</li>
<li>Ceramics</li>
<li>Quillwork</li>
<li>Beadwork</li>
</ul>
<p>More recently artworks have included <strong>painting on canvas</strong> and other European-style media.</p>
<p><strong>Geometric patterning</strong>, and <strong>figures</strong> that are mythic or shamanic often appear. <strong>Animals </strong>that are popular in Native American art include: <strong>snakes, birds, bison, and horses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Ruler’s feather headdress </strong>(probably of Motecuhzoma II) is made from <strong>feathers </strong>(quetzal and cotinga) and <strong>gold</strong>. The work measures <strong>3 feet 9 inches high.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>400 feathers</strong> symbolize eternity in Aztec culture.</p>
<p>The <strong>quetzal feathers</strong> only come from the male bird which has two to three tail feathers. The bird is only found in Costa Rica. This is an indication of long-distance trade that Aztecs participated in. It may also be a sign of tribute gifts given to Aztecs.</p>
<p>Additional feathers come from the <strong>cotinga bird</strong> (blue feathers) and the red <strong>snoonbill bird</strong> (red feathers). Feathers are both iridescent and allow movement with a breeze or turning.</p>
<p>Leather straps attach the crown to the head of a wearer. There are also ornamentations made of <strong>pure gold</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This head dress is a display of status and power by Motecuhzoma. It is part of a more elaborate costume that would have included earrings, tassels, and necklaces for rituals. The ruler would have had to walk up the steps of the Templo Mayor wearing these items. This displayed control over his own body and a superhuman strength and poise.</p>
<p>This work was sent by Spanish conquistador Cortes to HRE Charles V. It was meant not only to impress Charles V, but to encourage him to continue funding expeditions to the New World.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>This headdress was likely worn by <strong>Motecuhzoma II</strong> who was <strong>the last Aztec king</strong>. He was captured, kept as a hostage, and killed by Spaniards.  Cortes conquered the Aztecs by 1521.</p>
<p>This headdress is exceptional. It impressed the Europeans because at the time they had never seen anything like it.</p>

<p><strong>City of Cusco</strong> is located in <strong>the central highlands, of Peru</strong>, at an elevation of 11,200 feet. The city was designed to look like a miniature Inca empire.</p>
<p><strong>City of Cusco</strong> is divided into two sections. The <strong>north </strong>is where the<strong> upper class lived.</strong> The word for north is <strong>hanan.</strong> The <strong>south</strong> part of the city or <strong>hurin</strong> was where the lower classes lived.  The two sections were also further divided into quarters. This reflected the four corners of the empire. It takes on the shape of a puma/ jaguar, which is the royal animal of the Inca.</p>
<p>The <strong>masonry </strong>is special and unique to the region. Each individual stone is fitted uniquely to the one placed next to it. This results in blocks that have a varied number of sides. The goal is to keep each stone as true to its original shape as possible, but just flattened on the sides presented. This means the  blocks were not going to be like bricks.  Stones that are fitted this way allow for a small amount of movement. This is especially important in an earthquake-prone region. The modern city of Cusco is over a fault line.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of the City of Cusco</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Capital of the Inca empire</li>
<li>Civic center: religious; political; marketplace</li>
<li>Believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi</strong> (especially the temple of Qorikancha)</li>
<li>Way for Inca rulers to display their power and their ability to shape and order their empire

<li>Located on the heart of the puma</li>
<li>Qorikancha means “Golden House”</li>
<li>Most sacred of all Inca temples/shrines (<strong>axis-mundi</strong>)</li>
<li>Dedicated to the worship of the sun and sun god Inti</li>
<li>Center of the empire (like the sun in the universe) and everything radiated outward from it</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>masonry technique</strong> was even more time-consuming than normal Inca fitted stonework. Rather than fitting each stone together and creating an irregular-looking surface, each stone was <strong>shaped into a rectangular block</strong> and polished to a smooth finish.</p>
<p>The walls were then <strong>covered in sheets of gold</strong> to signify the shrine’s dedication to Inti. This would have brilliantly reflected the sun’s rays and embodied the purpose of the building.</p>
<p>In front was a <strong>sculpture garden</strong> with reproductions of the world in miniature containing, people, animals, and plants.</p>
<p><strong>After the Spanish conquest</strong>, Qorikancha was one of <strong>many shrines turned into a Christian space</strong>.</p>
<p>This was turned into the Church of Santo Domingo, named after Saint Dominic, the founder of Dominican order who emphasized conversions. It was built around and on top of the original shrine which was flattened except for one wall.</p>
<p>This symbolized appropriation and supremacy with the Spanish over the Inca and Christianity over the Inca religion. The new building was built in Spanish Baroque style, which was fashionable at the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Walls at Saqsa Waman </strong>walked down on the city of Cusco from the Northwest. The structure’s zig-zagging walls indicated its use as a fortress.</p>
<p>The <strong>stones </strong>were quarried and hauled into place using huge manpower. These were much larger than those used for streets and houses. This was defensive in function.</p>
<p>Francisco Pizarro was the Spaniard who conquered Inca.</p>
<blockquote><p>Through his brother there is this description of the site. “<em>On the top of a hill, they had a very strong fort surrounded with masonry walls of stones and having two very high round towers. In the lower part of this wall, there were stones so large and thick that it seemed impossible that human hands could have set them in place. They were so close together and so well fitted that the point of a pin could not have been inserted into one of the joints.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em><strong>A Background History </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1438</strong>: the Empire was founded by Pachacuti</li>
<li><strong>1440</strong>: the construction began</li>
<li><strong>1532 – 1535</strong>: Inca were conquered by Francisco Pizarro</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Rituals and Practices</strong></h5>
<p>The most <strong>important rituals and practices</strong> occurred in this capital city. It was considered <strong>a religious space. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Young women</strong> were chosen from across the empire based on their virginity, beauty, nobility, and status to serve as <strong>“chosen women”</strong>. They prepared ritual food, maintained a sacred fire, wove garments for Inca rulers, made corn beer for rituals, served gods in shrines, and were given to Inca royalty or aristocrats in marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Young men</strong> were brought to be educated and raised in Inca culture. They were indoctrinated into Inca culture since the empire was very vast and diverse. They became valuable advocates for Inca traditions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Maize cobs </em></strong>is a work made from <strong>sheet metal/repoussée, gold and silver. </strong>The vegetable replica<strong> measures 10 inches long.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Repoussé is a </strong>French  word meaning “to push back”.  It is a type of sculptural technique where the <strong>metal is beaten from the inside</strong> to leave raised designs on the surface.</p>
<p>Here, Inca metalsmiths expertly combined silver and copper to mimic the internal and external components of actual corn. Inca were known for their metalwork practice. They excelled at it.</p>
<p><strong>Silver metal </strong>was used for the corn. <strong>Gold metal </strong>was used for the husk. The life-sized husks are naturalistic in design.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Maize cobs</em></strong> would have been in the <strong>Inca sculpture garden</strong> outside of the Temple of Qorikancha. The garden was used three times a year for rituals related to sowing and harvesting maize. All of these objects acted as a display of the Inti (sun god’s) power, as well as an offering of thanks.</p>
<h5><strong>The Art of Corn</strong></h5>
<p>This work illustrates the <strong>ripe ear of corn</strong> breaking through its husk. It is still on the stalk but ready to be harvested.  Individual kernels protrude.</p>
<h5><strong>This Work in Context</strong></h5>
<p>The garden contained <strong>sculpted llamas, corn, flowers, and people</strong>. All were life size, and all were made from gold and silver metal. The garden essentially became a narrative that the Inca empire told about themselves. It Illustrated their piety but also all the riches of the empire</p>
<p>After the Spaniards arrived in the Andes, the European invaders soon desired Inca gold and silver.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest Spanish chroniclers record the placement of a huge sculpture garden outside the Qorikancha. These Inca objects were looted in large quantities, and many were sent back to Spain. <strong><em>Maize cobs</em></strong> might have ended up as a gift to HRE Charles V. By 1534, his court records mention a gold maize stalk with three leaves and two ears of corn.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Maize </strong>is corn that is blue or red but not yellow. It also represents the most important crop to the Inca. It was used for food, beer, and clothing.</p>

<p><strong>All-T’oqapu tunic </strong>is made from<strong> camelid fiber and cotton. </strong>It measures<strong> 3 by 2.5 feet. </strong>Weaving was usually done with a series of sturdy sticks upon which the <strong>warp</strong> (skeletal threads of the textile) was woven. There are 100 threads per centimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton </strong>grew well in the empire along the coast. It was made into a variety of colors.</p>
<p><strong>Camelids</strong> (remember Camelid sacrum?) thrived in the highlands (llamas and alpaca are camelids)</p>
<p>These animal fibers are dyed more easily than plant fibers. Dyes used included cochineal red that comes from the bodies of small insects that live on cactus. It takes thousands to make even just a small amount of dye. Another color is indigo blue which comes from a flower. Both dyes are extremely expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting, spinning, and dyeing fibers for a textile</strong> represented a huge amount of work. This as well as weaving was completed by women.</p>
<p>It was traditional to try to make a <strong>t’oqapu</strong> tunic in one single piece if possible. This would indicate the skill of the weaver and would avoid cutting the cloth, which was believed to damage its spiritual power.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Symbolizes the power/status of an Inca ruler</li>
<li>Social power: signifies ruler’s ability to command empire to produce this; chosen women sew</li>
<li>Political power: signifies one ruler’s control over this vast territory</li>
<li>Cultural power: signifies one ruler’s unification of these various clans and tribes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Military power: one of the t’oqapu (black and white checkerboard pattern) symbolizes the Inca military; shows that the army is an extension of the Inca ruler</li>
<li>Material power: control of resources and statement of the wealth of the Inca empire (expensive dyes, vast amounts of fabric)</li>
<li>Religious power: ruler is dressed like Vairococha (based on creation myth)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>T’oqapu</strong>: square geometric motifs that symbolize a particular noble family/clan/group (similar to a European family crest)</li>
<li><strong>T’oqapu tunics</strong> are only allowed to be worn by those of high rank</li>
<li>An <strong>all-t’oqapu</strong> is only allowed to be worn by a ruler.</li>
<li>It is <strong>a single piece of cloth</strong>, woven with slit in the center for the head to pass through (just like a poncho) with “sleeves” sewn along the side to close it up.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Refers to an important Inca creation myth Viracocha (god) after creating humans sent out all the different peoples with their ethnic patterns painted on their bodies to keep order over them</li>
<li>Textiles were the other major Inca artistic production (as well as metal work)</li>
<li>Textiles were produced by “chosen women” who were collected across the empire for their virginity, beauty, and status to weave fine cloth.</li>

<p><strong><em>Black on black ceramic vessel</em></strong> crafted by <strong>Maria Martinez and Julian Martinez</strong> was created in <strong>Tewa, Puebloan, and San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico. </strong></p>
<p>All raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully so the vessel could be fired properly.</p>
<p>They pioneered a style of <strong>applying a matte-black design over polished-black</strong>. By doing this they were able to recreate what ancestors had done before them.</p>
<h5><strong>Making This Work </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Take local iron rich clay</li>
<li>Mix with powder from shards of broken pots + volcanic ash + water</li>
<li>Make shape of pot by hand, without a potter’s wheel</li>
<li>Dry vessel</li>
<li>Scrape, sand, smooth</li>
<li>Cover with slip (clay + water)</li>
<li>Slip is polished by rubbing a smooth stone over the surface to flatten the clay and create a shiny finish. A difficult and time-consuming process.</li>
<li>Pot was painted with designs with an iron-rich solution by using iron ore or guaco, which is a wild plant.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Firing Process</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pots were dried, then <strong>fired at high temperatures</strong> to change brittle clay to ceramics</li>
<li>No kilns used, but fire was hot enough it could be made with manure</li>
<li>Smothering the fire with powdered manure during the firing removed the oxygen while retaining the heat and this resulted in a pot that was blackened with areas without slip turning shiny black, and areas with slip turning matte black</li>
<li>Achieving the <strong>deepest shades of black required about six firings.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created to <strong>revive traditions</strong> of Puebloan pottery making in New Mexico. This also helped to <strong>reframe Native pottery as fine art</strong>, instead of promoting it as utilitarian. To aide this, she began to <strong>sign her name</strong> on the bottom of the pots. This made her name the brand, but it also denied the communal nature of the pot. However, she began to make more money per pot.</p>
<p>The buyers were those that had interest in <strong>Native art</strong>, mainly white Americans. Soon, she began to sell the pots to major art galleries.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>San Ildefonso</strong> <strong>style</strong>: based on 12<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup> century Puebloan ceramic shards (based on Neolithic designs) that had recently been discovered in excavations</li>
<li>Two design registers: one across the shoulder/body and one across the neck</li>
<li>Elements are abstract, but are probably depicting natural motifs</li>
<li>Shape, color, and design match the contemporary and geometric Art Deco movement, popular between the two WWs</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Before the arrival of the railroad to this area in the 1880s, pots were used for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. When inexpensive pots appeared along the railroad, Native practices declined. The introduction of tin and metal meant cheaper, easier to make, sturdier pots.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artists </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Maria Martinez</strong> is one of the best-known Native potters in part due to her connections with a larger, non-Native audience. She lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso from 1887 to 1980. This is located 20 miles north of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>She spoke Tewa, the language of the Pueblo culture. Martinez learned the ceramic techniques by watching potters from San Ildefonso. Also, she and her husband Julian were present at the excavations in their community. They drew designs that they found on pottery shards.</p>
<p>Making pottery had traditionally been a communal activity, where different steps in the process were shared. <strong>Maria</strong> formed the vessels by hand. Julian would decorate and paint the pots.</p>
<p>Traditionally, because making pots were communal, they were never signed.</p>

</ul>
<p>This  reflects upon the art and art making of each different culture. Note the similarities and differences in the cultures, as well as in materials, processes, and techniques.</p>
<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is among the world’s oldest artistic traditions. Although its roots lie in northern  Asia, it developed independently between 10,000 BCE and 1492 CE, which marked the beginning of the European invasions.</p>
<p>Regions and cultures are referred to  as the <strong>Indigenous</strong> <strong>Americas</strong> to signal the priority of First Nations cultural traditions over those of the colonizing and migrant peoples that have progressively taken over the American continents for the past 500 years.</p>
<h5><strong>Categorization of the Art of Indigenous Americas </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is <strong>categorized </strong><strong>by</strong> <strong>geography</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>chronology</strong> into the designations of <strong>Ancient</strong><strong>    </strong><strong> America</strong> and <strong>Native</strong> <strong>North</strong> <strong>America</strong>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Ancient</strong> <strong>America</strong> is the category used for art created before 1550 century, south of the current United States–Mexico border. This region is traditionally divided into three main areas of culture— <strong>Mesoamerica, Central America*, Andean South America.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica </strong><strong>in Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica </strong>encompassed what is now <strong>Mexico</strong>, from Mexico City southward. It also includes <strong>Guatemala, Belize</strong>, and western <strong>Honduras</strong>, from 15,000 BCE to 1521 CE. The time of the Mexica (Aztec) downfall.</p>
<p>General cultural similarities of ancient Mesoamerica include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar calendars</li>
<li>Pyramidal stepped structures,</li>
<li>Sites and buildings oriented in relation to sacred mountains and celestial phenomena.</li>
<li>Highly valued green materials, such as jadeite and quetzal feathers.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Cultures and Styles</strong></h5>
<p>The styles from the various Mesoamerican cultures differed markedly.</p>
<p>Three major distinct cultures and styles of Ancient Mesoamerica (Middle America) were the <strong>Olmec</strong>, <strong>Maya</strong>, and Mexica, also known as <strong>Aztec, </strong>the empire that was dominated by the Mexica ethnic group.</p>
<p>The <strong>Olmec culture</strong> existed during the first millennium BCE, primarily in the Gulf Coast. <strong>The Mayan culture</strong> peaked during the first millennium CE in eastern Mesoamerica, the Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The Mexica culture existed from 1428 to 1521 CE in the region of central Mexico, though subordinating most of Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>There were other important cultures including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teotihuacan</strong></li>
<li><strong>Toltec</strong></li>
<li><strong>West Mexican</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mixtec</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zapotec</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Mesoamerican Sculptural Works</strong></h5>
<p>Mesoamerican sculptural and two-dimensional art tended toward the figural, particularly in glorification of specific rulers. Mythical events were also depicted in a realistic, figural mode. Despite the naturalistic styles and anthropomorphic interpretations of subject matter, shamanic transformation, visions, and depiction of other cosmic realms appear prominently in Mesoamerican art.</p>
<h5><strong>The Central Andes</strong></h5>
<p>The ancient <strong>Central Andes</strong> comprised present-day southern <strong>Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia</strong>, and northern <strong>Chile</strong>. General cultural similarities across the Andes included an emphasis on surviving and interacting with the <strong>challenging environments, reciprocity, and cyclicality</strong>, rather than individualism. There was a reverence for the <strong>animal and plant worlds</strong> as part of the practice of <strong>shamanistic religion</strong>.</p>
<p>As with ancient Mesoamerica, the Central Andes region was a seat of culture and art parallel to the “Old World” in antiquity, diversity, and sophistication. <strong>Baskets</strong> from this region have been found dating to as early as 8800 BCE, proving early peopling from Asia through the rest of the Americas was accomplished by Neolithic times.</p>
<p><strong>Chavín</strong> and <strong>Inka</strong> were representative and distinct early and late cultures and styles. <strong>Chavín </strong>lived in the northern highlands with reach to the southern coast between 1200–500 BCE. While the <strong>Inka </strong>between 1438–1534 CE covered the entire Central Andes. Yet many other important, art producing cultures existed between them.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Ecosystems and Environments</strong></h5>
<p>Similarities within Central Andean cultures can be traced to the influence of three significantly distinct ecosystems in proximity. These were <strong>the dominant Andes mountains</strong>, and a <strong>narrow desert coast</strong>. In addition, there was the Amazon rain forest, the largest rainforest on the planet.</p>
<p>These environments play a central role in art. Materials were influenced, especially by the <strong>prominence of camelid fiber and cotton textiles</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Working Together</strong></h5>
<p>The political systems included coastal diversity, as well as highland impulses toward unification. Other factors include overall values in the form of reciprocity, asymmetrical dualism, and travel across long distances.</p>
<p>Accordingly, most Andean art seems to have been made by <strong>collaborative groups</strong>. The best known being the <strong>Inka high-status <em>aclla</em></strong><em>, </em>the empire’s most talented <strong>women weavers</strong>, who were kept cloistered.</p>
<h5><strong>Gravesite Art</strong></h5>
<p>Peoples of the Andes practiced the world’s earliest and most persistent <strong>artificial mummification</strong>, in many forms, from 5500 BCE onward.  Almost all art became <strong>grave goods</strong> for use in the afterlife.</p>
<h5><strong>Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Art</strong></h5>
<p>Andean art tends to explore the <strong>terrestrial</strong> through <strong>animal and plant imagery</strong>, <strong>mountain veneration</strong>, <strong>sculpting of nature</strong> itself, and <strong>organic integration of architecture</strong> with the environment. It also concerns the <strong>non-terrestrial</strong> via <strong>abstraction and orientation toward the afterlife</strong> and the other realms of <strong>the cosmos</strong>. Shamanic visionary experience was a strong theme, especially featuring humans transforming into animal selves.</p>
<h5><strong>Native North American Art </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Native</strong> <strong>North</strong> <strong>America</strong> denotes traditionally oriented cultures <strong>north</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>United</strong> <strong>States–Mexico</strong> <strong>border</strong> from ancient times to the present, with an emphasis on the period from 1492 century to today. Native North America has many regional subunits, such as the <strong>Northwest</strong> <strong>Coast, </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Southwest,</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Plains,</strong> <strong>and</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Eastern</strong> <strong>Woodlands.  </strong></p>
<p>The various Native American groups may be seen to share larger ideas of <strong>harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership</strong>, and <strong>participation in large rituals</strong>, such as <strong>potlatches</strong> and <strong>sun dances.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-contact art</strong> not only reflects these long- standing values, but it is also concerned with the history of conflict within tribes and between indigenous people and the U.S. and Canadian governments.</p>
<p>Indians, Native Americans, <strong>North American Indians</strong> (in the United States), and <strong>First Nations</strong> (in Canada) are nonindigenous terms for the indigenous peoples. These people were inhabiting areas north of what is now the United States– Mexico border, from ancient times to the present. They did not have a collective name for themselves, being many different tribes and nations.</p>
<h5><strong>Indigenous Influence on Invaders</strong></h5>
<p>Mesoamerica has had an influence on its invaders and the world at large since the 16th century. Mesoamerica is the <strong>origin</strong> of many of the world’s staple foods— <strong>chocolate, vanilla, tomatoes, avocados, and maize, known as corn.</strong></p>
<p>Mesoamericans discovered <strong>rubber, invented the first ball game</strong>, and included several matrilineal and matriarchal cultures. Recognition of the importance of this area in world history and art has lagged, but it increases as inclusiveness and multiculturalism grow in scholarship and popular consciousness.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Impressions</strong></h5>
<p>When Mexico was first discovered by Europe, gifts of Mexica art sent to Charles V alerted such artists as Albrecht Dürer to the unfamiliar but impressive media and images from the New World. Colonial artists preserved certain pre-Hispanic traditions both overtly and covertly in their art. After independence from Spain, in the early 19th century, the Aztec were claimed in nationalistic causes, and national museums were created to promote ancient art.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Incorporation into Modern and Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>Twentieth-century muralists, such as <strong>Diego Rivera</strong>, overtly incorporated themes from the Mexica past. Twentieth-century European and American artists, such as Henry Moore and Frank Lloyd Wright, were strongly influenced by the sculpture and architecture of ancient Mesoamerica as well.</p>
<p>Being more distant geographically and aesthetically, Andean art was less well known to early modern Europe and current society than was Mesoamerican art. However, some key modern Euro- American artists, such as Paul Gauguin, Josef and Anni Albers, and Paul Klee, found inspiration in ancient Peruvian textiles and ceramics. Modern Latin American artists, such as <strong>Joaquín Torres Garcia</strong> of Uruguay, blended Inka art and architecture with modernist theory and style, exploring a common abstract vocabulary.</p>
<h5><strong>People and Language</strong></h5>
<p>Indigenous culture continues. More than seven million people speak Mayan languages today, and more than one million speak Nahuatl, the Aztec language. The European invasions prevailed beginning in 1534 CE, but indigenous descendants of ancient peoples remain. Eight to ten million people still speak Quechua, the Inka language.</p>
<h5><strong>Maintaining Cultural Identity</strong></h5>
<p>Although disease and genocide practiced by the European invaders and colonists reduced the Native American population by as much as 90 per cent, Native Americans today maintain their cultural identity and uphold modern versions of ancient traditions in addition to creating new art forms as part of the globalized contemporary art world. Because of the history of suppression and forced assimilation into white culture, the influence of Native North American art on modern U.S. and European art styles has been minimized. However, recent cultural revitalization of traditions and active contemporary artistic production by self-taught and academically trained artists keep Native American participation in global artistry alive.</p>
<p>Strains range from self-conscious revival of ancient arts, such as in Puebloan pottery, to cutting political commentary on racism and injustice.  Centuries of interaction with colonial and migrant peoples means that some <strong>imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon are now considered traditional</strong>. Likewise, in subject matter, the <strong>Spanish-introduced horse</strong> has become a cultural and artistic staple, alongside the indigenous buffalo, raven, and bear.</p>
<p>European influence is inevitable but may be subtle. What is considered traditional is constantly changing. There is no singular, timeless, authentic Native American art, or practice.</p>

<p><strong>Mesa Verde cliff dwellings </strong>located in<strong> Montezuma County, Colorado</strong>, are built into the side of a cliff and are made from <strong>sandstone </strong>from the canyon. Stone and mud mortar,  along with wooden beams were used to help raise multiple stories.</p>
<p>These are not the only cliff dwellings but <strong>the best-preserved examples of cliff dwellings.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>These cliff dwellings were used as a domestic space and civic spaces or residential dwelling that were used for storage and ritual.  They generally housed between 125 to 250 people.</p>
<p>Clans lived together for defence and support. Having homes set under the side of the cliff provided protection from sun and snow.</p>
<h5><strong>The Set Up</strong></h5>
<p>Cliff dwellings were known as <strong>pueblos</strong> (communal villages of flat-roofed structures that are made of stacked stone). <strong>Each family had one room</strong> and there were about 150 in total.</p>
<p>Some pueblos were <strong>five to six stories tall.</strong> The <strong>top houses stored supplies</strong>. Here it was cool, dry, out of the way, and only accessible by ladders.</p>
<p><strong>Kivas</strong> or rounded and sunken rooms, with wood-beamed roofs,  were  situated across the site. There were 20 in total. These were meeting rooms for <strong>civic and religious gatherings.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ancestral Puebloans</strong> occupied this region from about 450 CE to 1300 CE.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The dates that <strong>AP provides</strong> are the dates for which the Anasazi (tribe) occupied this area, NOT the dates of the construction of the site.</p>
<p>These communities were comprised of sedentary <strong>farmers </strong>who cultivated beans, squash, and corn.</p>
<p>From 450 – 1200s, farmers lived above the canyon and lived near their crops.</p>
<p>By the 13<sup>th</sup> century things changed. Farmers moved into the canyons and began to construct pueblos. This made things difficult as food and water had to be transported into the canyon, as the fields were now many miles away.</p>
<p><strong>Why did they move? </strong>Did the cliffs provide protection from invaders? Did the canyon provide ceremonial or spiritual significance? Did the canyon provide significant protection from environmental elements?</p>
<p>The <strong>cliffs were eventually abandoned</strong> in 1300 CE. It is not clear as to why . Was there drought? A lack of resources, or violence? Or some combination?</p>

<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Yaxchilan’s <strong>ruling dynasty</strong> rose in the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE. By the 8<sup>th</sup> century, the  Mayan cultural and political Renaissance was led by <strong>Shield Jaguar II</strong>. He ruled for 60 years from 681-741 CE and commissioned this site as well as many sculptural works.</p>
<p>Shield Jaguar had a son <strong>Bird Jaguar</strong> with his second wife. Shield Jaguar chose Bird Jaguar to be the next ruler, even though he was not royal because he did not come from the first wife.</p>
<p>Then from 741 – 752 <strong>Civil War</strong> raged.</p>
<p><strong>Bird Jaguar</strong> ruled from  752 – 768. He had difficulty being accepted by the Mayans because he <strong>lacked royal status. </strong>Therefore, many did not consider him the rightful heir to the throne.  To legitimize his throne, he had decorative steles and reliefs added to Yaxchilan.</p>
<p>The City-state of Yaxchilan <strong>collapsed in 9<sup>th</sup> century</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a fact: </strong>Maya writing was not fully deciphered until 1970s and 1980s</p>
<h5><strong>Women and the Maya Court </strong></h5>
<p>Women played <strong>a prominent role</strong> in the Maya court.  They held positions as queens and mothers. Being a principal wife meant that you were believed to have particularly significant power and became part of the bloodletting ritual&#8212; central to legitimizing kingship.</p>
<p>Digs in Structure 23 have found sharp objects for bloodletting with Lady Xoc’s name on them. It is assumed she is buried somewhere around the temple.</p>
<p>It was believed that when a member of the royal family shed his or her blood, a portal to the other world was opened allowing gods and spirits to pass through it.  <strong>Letting blood was a sign of sacrifice and piety</strong> to acquire the favor of the gods. This helped to dedicate new buildings, legitimize kings, and commemorate births of children.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodletting for queens</strong> was believed to grant significant visions. However, medically, these visions were <strong>hallucinatory states</strong> resulting from large amounts of blood loss.</p>

<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu </strong>is in the<strong> Central highlands of Peru. </strong>Made of<strong> granite </strong>it measures roughly<strong> 530 by 200 meters. </strong>Sitting on a sacred mountain 8000 feet up, it overlooks the Urubamba River.</p>
<p>The granite was left unpainted and fitted with<strong> stone masonry</strong> techniques. Most structures were roofed with wood and thatch with straw and reeds.</p>
<p>There was <strong>one doorway/gate</strong> to access the site. This controlled movement and the view.</p>
<p><strong>Terraces</strong> or flat gardens cut into the mountain side, were a common element of the Inca. This Increased arable land surface and allowed the Inca to be agricultural, even though there was no flat arable farmland available.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu </strong>was built as a royal estate for the first Inka emperor, Pachacuti. The emperor only lived here for a maximum of six months per year. It was intended as a place where the Inca could entertain, perform religious ceremonies, and administer the empire.</p>
<p>The city represented an expression of power and status.</p>
<p>The ability to command people across the empire to construct this was an expression of  the emperor’s power.  The modification of the landscape by shaving the off top of  the mountain, as well as the prediction of the sun, indicated he controlled nature. This legitimized his claim to the throne.</p>
<p>The site contained over 200 buildings in total with <strong>housing for elites, army, and staff. </strong>There were <strong>religious shrines, fountains, baths, astronomies, </strong>and<strong> terraces</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the <strong>high-status residential buildings</strong> are in a cluster to the Northeast (right-hand side of main image). The <strong>royal section</strong> was separated on the Southwest side (the left-hand side of main image).</p>

<p>The Observatory is adjacent to the royal residence (towers). It is composed of two main parts: an upper room with windows (likely symbolized the heavens) and a lower room with no windows (likely symbolized the underworld).</p>
<p>The windows in the upper room clearly reveal that they had been moved in the masonry. This may have been to position them to the most accurate placement to frame the summer solstice sunrise.</p>

<p>The term refers to the <strong>“hitching post of the sun”</strong>, as Inti means sun.</p>
<p>The carved boulder is in the ritual area of the site to the west of the main plaza. The stone’s name refers to the idea that it was used to track the passage of the sun throughout the year. Again, if the Inca ruler claimed to be a descendant of the sun, and he could track the sun, it would legitimize his claims that he had the right to rule.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Points </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Not even excavated until 1911</li>
<li>Location was approximately a three days’ walk from the Inca capital of Cusco</li>
<li>Graves found on the site reveal a huge variety of people who lived and worked here.</li>
<li>Inca rulers claimed to be descendants of the sun and therefore, they were considered gods on earth.</li>

<p><strong>Bandolier bag</strong> is a crafted bag made with <strong>beadwork on leather</strong>. It measures <strong>2 feet by 1 foot and 6 inches</strong>.</p>
<p>Thousands of tiny beads were strung together and then sewn onto the bag. <strong>These glass beads are known as seed beads</strong> and are prized for their brilliant color and tiny form.</p>
<p>The bag is also <strong>decorated with silk ribbons</strong> in yellow, blue, red, green, and orange. Each are various lengths.</p>
<p><strong>A thick strap</strong> crossing from one edge of the bag to the other side allows it to rest over a person’s shoulder and sit on the hip</p>
<h5><strong>A Utilitarian Function:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Original function: Used by French army to hold extra ammunition</li>
<li>2<sup>nd</sup> function: Used by French fur traders in the NW United States to hold extra ammunition</li>
<li>Native American function: Worn as a cross-body bag mostly by men
<ul>
<li>Pockets weren’t necessarily used to hold objects.</li>
<li>More importantly, the design helped to express group identities and social status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Notes of Interest</strong></h5>
<p>Each bag is unique, often large in size and decorated with a wide array of colorful beads and ribbons. The contrasting colors might symbolize sky versus the underworld. The four-pronged/pointed flowers or stars might indicate the four cardinal directions and a connection to the earth.</p>
<p>The Prairie Style uses colorful glass seed beads to make floral patterns.</p>
<h5><strong>Context:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Due to the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), many tribes were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to Oklahoma and Wisconsin.
<ul>
<li>Lenape were one of those tribes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tribes continued to create these bags however they were exposed to a variety of other Native American tribes that were not familiar with this art. A diffusion of design and style called Prairie Style evolved post 1830s (Midwest tribes: floral designs + Eastern tribes: seed beads and bags)</li>
<li>Women created these bags.</li>
<li>Cross-cultural influence: not only did the shape and style of bag come from Europeans, but the seed beads and silk ribbons were acquired from European traders.
<ul>
<li>Native Americans had never seen glass or brilliant color the way they saw them in the beads or ribbon.</li>
<li>Native Americans often traded land for beads/ribbons.</li>
<li>Europeans thought beads/ribbons were cheap and that they were getting better end of the deal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Painted elk hide</em></strong> is a work <strong>attributed to Cotsiogo (Cadzi Cody) from the Eastern Shoshone, Wind River Reservation, Wyoming</strong>.  It is made from <strong>painted elk hide.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cotsiogo (co SEE ko)</strong></p>
<p>In Native American art elk, deer and buffalo hides were traditionally used to minimize the waste of animals by using all the parts. Natural pigments were used such as red ochre or chalk. Any used synthetic paints and dyes were obtained from Euro-Americans.</p>
<p>The Imagery was done with <strong>free-hand painting and some stenciling. </strong>There is a sense of flattened and negative space. The work is stylized and in simple form with no modeling.</p>
<h5><strong>Multipurpose Art</strong></h5>
<p>Creations such as<strong> <em>Painted elk hide </em></strong>were made for wall hangings and for robes, as well as being a sign of status.  Hide paintings were traditional artworks for Plains Indians and depicted religious scenes, major events, tribal designs, or affiliations. The content would change depending on the audience.</p>
<p>Later these works were created for those interested in Native culture and life as well as tourists. Popular themes for these buyers include buffalo hunts, as well as Native Americans on horseback and in teepees.</p>
<p>Artmaking for Native Americans is a way of keeping traditions alive.</p>
<h5><strong>Scenes of Celebration and Daily Life</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Three Dances </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sun Dance</strong> is an important, <strong>sacred dance</strong>. It surrounds a not-yet-raised buffalo head between two poles with an eagle above it. Dancers dance around the pole as a celebration of the renewal of life, earth, and people. It honors the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>Grass Dance</strong> involves men dancing around poles to bless the land.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf Dance</strong> is <strong>a non-religious dance that celebrates warriors</strong> on horses returning to camp. It is about the power and prestige of warriors.</p>
<p><strong>Scenes of daily life are shown</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Women rest near a fire</li>
<li>Men hunt for buffalo and some wear feathered war bonnets to depict bravery.</li>
<li>Two teepees represent the camp</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The hide depicts past events and vibrancy of Native American life, rather than current reality. It shows them <strong>hunting with bows and arrows</strong>, but by the time this art was created, <strong>they used rifles</strong>, introduced by Euro-Americans. Additionally, Native Americans didn’t live out in plains, but they lived on reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Horses</strong> are not native to North America. They had been introduced by the Spaniards and arrived in the Midwest via trade.</p>
<p><strong>Buffalo</strong> were sacred. By the time Cotsiogo painted this, they had almost been entirely killed off.</p>
<p>Sadly, the <strong>Sun Dance</strong> had been outlawed by the US Government to compel the Native Americans to abandon their traditional ways.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>During his life <strong>Cotsiogo (1866-1912)</strong> was placed on the Wind River Reservation. He was the son of Washakie, a renowned Shoshane leader. As one of the first commercial artists among his tribe. He enjoyed artistic pursuits as they satisfied his curiosity.</p>
<p>Although the Sun Dance was outlawed at the time, he likely added the images because he knew it was a subject that tourists were interested in. Yet, he modified it to include the Wolf Dance to avoid ramifications.</p>
