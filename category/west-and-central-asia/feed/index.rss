										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Asian Art Gallery Review 7 &amp; 8</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2131" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?resize=990%2C654&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="654" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this gallery, you will achieve an understanding of <strong>art and architecture of West, Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia.</strong> How is art and architecture evidence of cross-cultural connections and influences? How are religious beliefs and practices represented within art and architecture? How does patronage influence artistic and architectural production?</p>
<p>You will explore the cultural distinction of Asia</p>
<ul>
<li>the religions of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism</li>
<li>the influence of these religions and social hierarchy on art and architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Gallery Objectives</strong></h5>
<p>Different cultural and religious values are reflected in the art and architecture of a culture and dictate how sacred space is used. The beliefs of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism necessitated different characteristics in the sacred architecture and art. This is evidenced in how deities are represented in the art and the architectural designs. Trade transmitted both religious and artistic influence throughout Asia, and political entities utilized art and architecture to represent religious support of leadership.</p>
<h4><strong>Monuments of Faith</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>distinguish architectural elements of mosques</li>
<li>recognize the connection between religious needs and religious function of architecture</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sacred Connections</strong></h5>
<p>Think about your community and the buildings it contains. Can you visualize political structures like city hall or the courthouse? Do they contain common features like columns or large, ascending staircases? Think about places of worship in your community. Do they contain common features?</p>
<p>The use of architecture for religious needs is a common thread that connects cultures, despite time or geography. There are elements that are specific to religion or culture, like the <strong>ark in Jewish synagogues</strong>, <strong>the cross in Christian cathedrals</strong>, and the <strong>mihrab</strong> in Muslim <strong>mosques</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The definition of Islam is &#8220;submission to the one God,&#8221; and its followers are referred to as Muslim, or &#8220;those who submit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Islam rose in Arabia early in the 7th century and eventually brought the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Its extensive advance was not only the result of military conquests, but also of the nature of the Islamic faith and its appeal to millions of converts. This advance resulted in altering sacred architecture in regions that were conquered to accommodate the needs of Muslim worshipers.</p>
<p>The art and architecture of the Muslims represents the different techniques and ideas from diverse cultures that converted to Islam, and the impact of Islam was reflected in the art and architecture of other cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Art and architecture can have a sacred function.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Pillars of Islam</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2247 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=599%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="599" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?w=599&amp;ssl=1 599w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2247" class="wp-caption-text">Koran Manuscript</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are <strong>commonalities between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity</strong>. Islam incorporates Old Testament teachings, ethical standards, and rejection of idol worship. <strong>All three beliefs segment after the Old Testament.</strong></p>
<p>Muslims worship without a hierarchy of rabbis, priests, or saints acting as intercessors. Muhammad was believed to be God’s messenger and is considered the Final Prophet in a line that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He began to receive revelations of God through the archangel Gabriel and was persecuted by Meccan leaders who disagreed with his message.</p>
<p>In 622 C.E., he fled the city of Mecca for a desert oasis called Medina, or “City of the Prophet.” This exodus was called the <em>hijra</em>, or emigration, and is considered the beginning of the Islamic religion. Eight years later, Muhammad returned to Mecca with an army of 10,000, took control of the city, and converted the population to Islam.</p>
<p>Muhammad destroyed all the idols and preserved the <em>Kaaba</em>, the symbolic center of the Islamic world. He died in Medina in 632 C.E.</p>
<p>Muslims live according to the <em>Koran</em>, Islam’s sacred book.</p>
<p>This book was arranged by the Muslim ruler, Uthman, and contains the collected revelations communicated through Muhammad during his lifetime. It has 114 surahs, or chapters, divided into verses.</p>
<p>The duties of the Islamic faith include the <strong>Five Pillars of Islam</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Shahadah</strong>: Assert that <strong>there is only one God</strong> and that Muhammad is his messenger.</p>
<p><strong>Salat</strong>: Pray five times a day facing Mecca (where <em>The Kaaba</em> is located).</p>
<p><strong>Zakah</strong>: Give <strong>alms</strong> to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>Sawm</strong>: Fast during the month of <strong>Ramadan</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hajj</strong>: Make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime (if possible).</p>
<p>The Five Pillars guide Muslims in the commitment and practice of Islam, and the reward for the faithful is paradise. Islam also features a union of religious and secular authority, joining religious and political leadership in one ruler. This practice continued after Muhammad in the form of caliphs, or successors, who took charge of the community’s political and spiritual matters.</p>
<h5><strong>Is the Center of the World a Cube?</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> is a cubical, textile-draped shrine said to have been built for God by Abraham and Ishmael. It had been inundated with pagan idols before Muhammad conquered Mecca. After the battle at Mecca, Muhammad removed the idols, preserved the structure, and dedicated it to Allah.</p>
<figure id="attachment_789" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-789" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-789" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?resize=700%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="465" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?w=337&amp;ssl=1 337w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-789" class="wp-caption-text">The Kaaba<br />© Kazuyoshi Nomachi/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stripping of the idols resulted in the concept of <strong>aniconism</strong><strong>,</strong> avoiding figural imagery and graven images, in art. <strong>Islamic art that is created for religious purposes</strong> does not contain figural imagery. Islamic art and architecture take on both sacred and secular function. <strong>Aniconism</strong> has, therefore, resulted in variances in the imagery of sacred and secular art and architecture.</p>
<p>Religious architecture includes both mosques and commemorative monuments, but <strong>in comparison to religious buildings from Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity</strong>, there is an evident lack of <strong>graven images</strong>. Manuscripts or objects containing sacred text can contain <strong>calligraphy</strong>, <strong>illumination</strong>, or <strong>geometric and plant decoration</strong>, but cannot have the representation of figures. Due to the religious purpose of the Islamic commemorative monuments, <strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong><em>,</em> there is no figural imagery.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> represents the center of the Islamic world, is the place where all Muslim prayer is directed, and is the destination of the Islamic pilgrimage, or hajj.</p>
<figure id="attachment_788" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-788" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-788" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?resize=700%2C463&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="463" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?w=440&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-788" class="wp-caption-text">Gathering at the Kaaba<br />© ALI JAREKJI/Reuters/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>This monument is covered with a silk curtain that is <strong>embroidered with calligraphy</strong> in gold and silver-wrapped thread. The use of expensive materials is often a representation of paradise in Muslim art and architecture. The curtain lacks figural imagery and is replaced annually during the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Every year during the month of pilgrimage, Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca. This occurs from the eighth to the twelfth of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar, and as it is a <strong>lunar calendar</strong>, it is 11 days shorter than the common <strong>Gregorian calendar</strong> used as standard today.</p>
<p>The worshipers move around, or <strong>circumambulate</strong>, the <em>Kaaba</em> seven times in a counterclockwise direction. This act is believed to show the unity of the believers in worship of Allah. Worshipers rise from the lowest of the seven steps, or stages, of the soul to the highest.</p>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been modified and expanded extensively throughout its history to fix damage that had occurred, enlarge the area, or replace the cover. The last alterations took place in the 1950s by the Saudi Arabian government to accommodate the large number of pilgrims who come on the Hajj.</p>
<h5><strong>The <em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-793" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-793" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=700%2C704&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="704" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-793" class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Rock<br />© SEF/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is the first great Islamic monument and the third most holy site in Islam. It was commissioned as an architectural tribute to the triumph of Islam by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik between 687 and 692 C.E. It is built on the Noble Enclosure or “The Foundation Stone,” a rock that is the site of the first and second Jewish temples.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-794" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-and-Exterior-Drwaing.jpg?resize=600%2C553&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="553" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The site is also significant as it is the presumed location of Adam’s grave, the place where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac, and the location where Muhammad began his journey to heaven. The coming of a new religion to Jerusalem was marked by building on a site holy to both the Jewish and Christian faiths. The <strong><em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong> is the first architectural display of Islam’s belief: that it completed the prophecies of both Judaism and Christianity and supersedes them. It is a statement of the idea that Islam is the completion of the worshiper’s connection with God.</p>
<figure id="attachment_795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-795" style="width: 683px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-795" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?resize=683%2C860&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="683" height="860" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-795" class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Rock<br />© Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>With a central-plan structure, the<em> <strong>Dome of the Rock</strong></em> imitates the form of early Christian and Byzantine <strong>martyria</strong>. The 75-foot double-shelled dome is made of wood, and then covered with gold, a valuable material used as a representation of paradise. It is supported by alternating piers and columns. This creates <strong>concentric</strong> aisles that allow worshipers to circumambulate the rock in the center, again demonstrating the oneness of the Muslims in worship.</p>
<h4><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>summarize the impact of Islamic art on outlying cultures and regions</li>
<li>explain the role of calligraphy in religious artworks, luxury objects, and architecture</li>
<li>compare Islamic architecture with architecture of other cultures <strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Calligraphy was a prominent art form, particularly in Islamic art in West Asia where beautiful forms were created to transmit sacred texts. Calligraphy is found on <strong>architecture, decorative arts objects</strong>, and <strong>ceramic tiles</strong>, as well as in <strong>manuscripts</strong> written on paper, cloth, or vellum.</p>

<figure id="attachment_2253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253" style="width: 999px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2253" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?resize=990%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="483" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2253" class="wp-caption-text">A close up of the inscription</figcaption></figure>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an <strong>inscription of poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</p></blockquote>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The fourth line provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>The Reverence of Calligraphy in Islamic Art </strong></h5>
<p>Islamic culture values poetry and oral tradition. They believed that the message of God was revealed through the prophet Muhammad, so words are the priority of the religion. Unlike Christianity it does not have a use for iconic images.</p>
<p>The beautiful writings of calligraphy were considered the highest art. It was used not only to spread the words of the Qur’an but also decorative images as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: &#8220;The first thing God created was the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Islamic calligraphy includes </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Arabic Calligraphy, Ottoman, and Persian calligraphy</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">. It developed from two major styles: </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Kufic</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">, the oldest form of Arabic script and </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Naskh</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">, traditionally used for more informal purposes. It is important to note that there are variations on each style, as well as regional differences.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Folio from a Qur’an</em></strong> was created with ink, color, and gold on parchment paper. The paper was costly and made from sheep or goat skin.  The work measures 12 inches wide.</p>
<figure id="attachment_820" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-820" style="width: 986px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-820" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=986%2C570&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="986" height="570" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-820" class="wp-caption-text">Folio from a Qur’an<br />© The Pierpont Morgan Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The word folio simply means a page in a book. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p><strong>The page uses calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used is known as Kufic. This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>
<p>Early Korans would only feature three to five lines per page to meet the need for visual clarity, as there were times one Koran would be shared by several readers. Since the copies were hand-produced and were finely crafted, they were expensive and rare. <strong>The red marks</strong> function as pronunciation guides, and the chapter title, page numbers, geometric designs, and vegetal imagery are embedded in the golden ornament in the middle of the page. <strong>Gold is significant, as it is symbolic of paradise in Islamic culture.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Luxury Objects</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2513" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?resize=460%2C697&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="460" height="697" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?w=248&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Court of Gayumars, folio from Shah Tahmasp’s Shahnama. Sultan Muhammad. c. 1522–1525 C.E. Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calligraphy was used to embellish luxury objects</strong>. These smaller-scale luxury arts feature an immense collection of manuscript paintings, ceramics, and metalwork and are examples of both the range and quality of Islamic skill. <em>The Shahnama, or Book of King</em>s, is a Persian national epic poem by Firdawsi (904–1025 C.E.) that recounts the history of Iran from creation until the Muslim conquest. This poem is paired with manuscript paintings in the Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp. There are 258 illustrations by many artists in this book that was presented as a gift to Selim II, who commissioned the Selimiye Mosque.</p>
<p>This specific page, <em><strong>Court of Gayumars</strong></em>, was painted by Sultan Muhammad. A non-religious work, it uses figural imagery to depict Gayumars, the legendary first king of Iran, as he presides over his court from his mountain throne.</p>
<p>The image is placed off-center as if it is floating, and delicate figures of the court, animals, trees, rocks, and sky populate a lush landscape. This enhances the sense of lightness and airiness, giving the illustration a heavenly appearance and a reference to paradise. The animals, trees, and rocks support the text in the Shahnama, which states that wild beasts became instantly tame in the presence of the Gayumars.</p>
<p>The poem, in calligraphy, encompasses the top and bottom of the painting. The manuscript became part of a private collection in the West and was eventually split and sold as individual pages. This is evidence of the Western collector’s view that each page was an independent work of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic metalwork</strong>, which encompassed <strong>metal plaques, vessels, arms, armor, and sculpture, was considered one of the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world</strong>, extending well beyond West Asia. Islamic metalsmiths would ornament the surface of vessels with scrolls, interlacing designs, <strong>calligraphic inscriptions</strong>, and human and animal figures. As these vessels were not religious in nature, the aniconism of the Islamic religion does not apply.</p>
<p>The<strong> Basin</strong> by Muhammad ibn al-Zain is made of brass and inlaid with gold and silver. The practice of inlaid brass work was common from the mid-12th century forward due to a shortage of silver. Basins similar to this were used for washing hands at official political ceremonies, and this specific basin may have been fashioned for a Mamluk sultan for use in his palace.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2514" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=675%2C452&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="675" height="452" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=1024%2C686&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?resize=1536%2C1029&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Basin.jpg?w=1770&amp;ssl=1 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Basin (Baptistère de St. Louis). Muhammad ibn al-Zain. c. 1320–1340 C.E. Brass inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The skill of the work denotes the generosity of the patron, but the lack of a specific inscription means there is no evidence of whom the basin was created for. The artist, Muhammad ibn al-Zain, signed the basin six times. This was uncommon, and the exact reason al-Zain did this is unknown.</p>
<p>The surface is decorated with three bands whose backgrounds feature stylized vegetal forms of inlaid silver. The upper and lower bands depict running animals, and the center band shows Mamluk hunters and Mongol enemies. Both the inside and underside are decorated with figures and animals. The basin was acquired by the French and referred to as the <strong><em>Baptistère de St. Louis</em></strong>. It was used in the baptismal rites of newborns of the French royal family as early as the 17th century and is an example of both the status and widespread influence of Islamic art.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mughals–a Little Islamic… And a Little European too</strong></h5>
<p>The Mughals were the most successful of the many Islamic groups that established themselves in India beginning in the 12th century, and they presided over a cosmopolitan court with refined tastes. Foreign ambassadors and merchants often visited, and the emperors admired Persian art and sought out European luxury goods. This resulted in <strong>artworks and architecture that had both European and Islamic influence,</strong> an outcome of cross-fertilization.</p>
<p>Jahangir was the fourth Mughal emperor and ruled from 1605 until 1627. Jahangir commissioned a painting from the <strong><em>artist Bichitr</em></strong>, who portrayed his patron in both a European and Islamic style. The painting Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings features a scroll-like border with intricate vegetal patterns.</p>
<p>Islamic influence is seen in the intricate vegetal patterns framing the painting, and <strong>the calligraphy is in two pairs of cartouches both at the top and the bottom of the painting</strong>. The intricate vegetal patterns are continued in the lower portion of the painting. Jahangir is shown sitting on top of an hourglass throne, with four figures to the left. The top figure is a Muslim Sufi Shaykh, or mystic saint, who is being presented with a book from Jahangir, below him is a Turkish sultan, then a full European style portrait of King James I of England, and then below him a representation of the artist himself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-844" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=500%2C729&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="729" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em>. Bichitr. c. 1620 C.E. Watercolor, gold, and ink on paper.</strong></p>
<p>The allegorical style of the painting is evidence of the European influence of style. The tower of figures represents the social hierarchy in the emperor’s eyes.</p>
<p>The inscription “although to all appearances kings stand before him, Jahangir looks inwardly toward the dervishes” attests that the emperor looks to Islamic holy men for guidance.</p>
<p>By placing himself in the lowest place in the tower, <strong>Bichitr </strong>recognizes that he is lowest in status. He also portrays himself giving Jahangir a gift, displaying his reverence for the emperor. The hourglass symbolizes that Jahangir sits above time. The side profile view of the faces is evidence of European influence, but King James I of England’s face is looking directly at the painter, as it was copied from a painting given as a gift to Jahangir. Jahangir’s head is encircled in a radiant halo that combines a sun and a white crescent moon. This <strong>halo is a visual display of Jahangir’s title of honor</strong> and evidence of European and Byzantine influence. This, in addition to the scrollwork and calligraphy, is also evidence of Islam influence, specifically from the Shahnama.</p>
<h5><strong>Calligraphy and Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>In the Buddhism of India, writing was always encouraged not only by monks and nuns, but the regular, everyday person who was Buddhist. This involved handwriting Buddhist scripture.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhist Calligraphy </strong>refers to the lettering art that draws subject from Buddhist literature. The artists are Buddhists and secular individuals.</p>
<p>Then there is<strong> calligraphy of Buddhists. </strong>This form of calligraphy does not necessarily present words from Buddhism.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chinese calligraphy</strong>, more than half of the famous works from ancient China are based on Buddhist subjects or created by Buddhists. These works can be classified into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manuscripts</li>
<li>Inscriptions</li>
<li>Engraving Scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>It is further classified by author:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calligraphy of Buddhists</li>
<li>Calligraphy of Secular Artists</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Manuscripts</strong></h5>
<p>Long before printing presses, <strong>Chinese Buddhist masters</strong> copied all scriptures into manuscripts by hand. The work starts with a title, main section containing spaces between paragraphs and a postscript. The result is simplistic yet elegant.</p>
<h5><strong>Inscriptions</strong></h5>
<p>Inscriptions were also part of Buddhist calligraphy. One area of prominence was grottoes art in famous Buddhist temple grottoes.</p>
<p>Such Chinese Buddhist temple grottoes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yungang</li>
<li>Longmen</li>
<li>Dunhuang</li>
</ul>
<p>These inscriptions were used for models for later calligraphers.</p>
<p>Other inscriptions can be found in mountains and stupas.</p>
<h5><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Calligraphic style of the Buddhist sect known as Zen in Japan and Cha’an in China included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bokuseki</strong>, or ink trace in Japanese.</li>
<li>Chinese <strong>(Wade-Giles romanization) Mo-chi, </strong>or (Pinyin)<strong>Moji</strong>,</li>
</ul>
<p>These forms of calligraphy were a direct result of Cha’an Buddhism crossing into Japan during the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century. During the Moromachi period (1338-1573) <strong>Bokuseki</strong> was a part of a distinguished monks accomplishments. Monks admired for this include:  Musō Soseki (1275–1351), Sesson Yūbai (1290–1346), and Tesshū Tokusai (fl. 1342–66).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ani-Aniconism</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>recognize the representation of the divine in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>contrast sacred spaces related to Hinduism and Buddhism</li>
<li>examine religious burial practices in South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Hindu Art and Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Similar to calligraphy in Islam, <strong>mantras are written ornately on Hindu art and architecture</strong>. The first symbol in the Tibetan mantra pictured is Om. As Hindus worship, mantras are recited that bring the deity into the image. Om is used at the end of a prayer as an invitation to the deity.</p>
<p>The belief that the deity is present is not taken lightly, and the image will not be removed from the temple. Individuals pray and make offerings like food, flowers, water, oil, dancing, or ritual sacrifices to the deity, supporting their belief that the deity is physically present in the image and, therefore, must be cared for.</p>

<h5><strong>Hindu Temples, Break It Down</strong></h5>
<p>From the 10th through the 14th centuries, India was largely a cluster of small kingdoms and different areas that developed highly individualized styles. The forms for temples in the north and south remained standard, although each building reflected the creator&#8217;s personal aesthetic and spiritual sensibility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2566" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?resize=598%2C794&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="598" height="794" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?w=271&amp;ssl=1 271w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Image: Shikara (tower) in a northern-style temple, carved from base to tip with colorful figures and reliefs.</strong></p>
<p>In the northern-style temple, the tower is called a <strong>shikara</strong>. It has a slightly convex shape and tapers at the top, where it is crowned by a flattened and fluted stone called an amalaka or fruit.At the very top, a finial connects the earthly realm below to the celestial above. Temples are symbolic in form, based on the mandala that symbolically connects the heavens and earth.</p>

<p><strong>The Vishnu Temple</strong> at Deogarh is one of the earliest temples in this northern style. The doorway, visible in this image, demonstrates the importance of the concept of the portal.</p>
<p>This is the passage from the ordinary world of the flesh to a place of spirit. Stepping over the threshold is a symbolic act of purification.</p>
<h5> Buddhism Iconism-Aniconism</h5>
<p>“To the first of his followers, and the tradition associated with <strong>Theravada Buddhism</strong> and figures like the great Emperor Ashoka, the Buddha was a man, not a God. He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of <strong>India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand</strong>.</p>
<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the <strong>Mahayana School</strong>, Buddha was a savior and often a god—a god concerned with man’s sorrows above all else. The Mahayana form of Buddhism is <strong>in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan</strong>. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.</p>
<p>The <strong>aniconic mode</strong> of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism</strong> (Sanchi Stupa) developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that never show the Buddha in human form. Instead, his presence was <strong>indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations</strong> as well as by his “non-image.”</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>the Chinese aniconic phase refrained from any pictorial representation</strong> and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy.</strong> The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.</p>
<p>A record left by the thirteenth-century monk Dharmasvamin of his visit to Bodh Gaya is especially interesting considering the problem of <strong>aniconism</strong>. Like earlier pilgrims to the sacred site, Dharmasvamin did not find the living Buddha at Bodh Gaya. Instead, what he described is not unlike what we see in some of the so-called aniconic reliefs, for he said that &#8220;inside the courtyard stood the empty throne of Sakyamuni . . . which was worshipped, and an eternal offering lamp was kept in front of it.”</p>

<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa Early Aniconic representations of Buddha: “the non-image”</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>At the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi 1st century CE </strong></h5>
<p>Sculptural friezes at important early Buddhist stupas like Sanchi depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the <strong>Buddha represented in aniconic form, using certain fixed symbols</strong>. On the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi the Buddha’s body is <strong>represented by the Body tree</strong>, a crowning lotus rosette on a column like structure, a stupa, the Buddha’s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).</p>
<p>Each symbol represents a pivotal event in Buddha’s life: <strong>a lotus</strong> (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, <strong>a fig tree or throne</strong> representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, <strong>a wheel, a flaming column</strong> with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and <strong>a stupa</strong> (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.  In some cases he is also represented by <strong>a pair of footprints</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>The icon (corporeal body) of the Buddha in India and China: Gandhara style</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Buddhism along the Silk Road Gandharan Buddha 2nd century</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandhara</strong> is the ancient name of a region in northwest Pakistan bounded on the west by the Hindu Kush Mountain range and to the north by the foothills of the Himalayas. In 330 B.C., Alexander the Great conquered this region and familiarized its artists with the classical Greek sculpture.</p>
<p>Starting about 50 B.C., Kushan era, the sea trade driven by monsoons increased. Thus, merchants from Rome and the Middle East passed through <strong>Gandhara</strong> on their way to Central Asia and China. Gandharan control of the high mountain passes vital to this international commerce made the region wealthy. The resulting cosmopolitan elites became some of the most powerful Buddhist patrons in all of South Asia.</p>
<p>Gandhara’s art combines <strong>(syncretism)</strong> local characteristics with elements derived from <strong>both Indian and western (Greek, Roman) cultures.</strong></p>
<p>After the 1st century C.E., with the development of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form. These new, iconic images of the Buddha were particularly popular in the region of Gandhara and in Māthura, south of New Delhi. They were depictions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, i.e. bodhisattvas. Many of the concepts characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism—the later form of Buddhism—appear to have developed in Gandhara.</p>
<p>These <strong>anthropomorphic images usher in a new phase of Buddhist art</strong> in which artists convey meaning through the <strong>depiction of special bodily marks (lakshanas) and hand gestures (mudras)</strong> of the Buddha.</p>
<p>In this anthropomorphic image of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the artist depicts Prince Siddhartha seated on a throne, surrounded by the demon Mara and his army, who attempted—unsuccessfully—to thwart Prince Siddhartha’s attainment of enlightenment. At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth, calling the earth to witness his spiritual awakening. In doing so he becomes the Buddha.</p>

<ul>
<li>the body is hidden with heavy cloak echoing a Roman toga; its sharp folds echoing Greek Parthenon draping styles form concentric curves centered on the right shoulder.</li>
<li>the face is elongated, the chin is quite prominent, and the corners of the relatively thin mouth are slightly sunken.</li>
<li>the eyes are narrow under a heavy lid, gazing downward in compassion to the world</li>
<li>the wavy Greek-like hair is gathered into a topknot symbolic of wisdom</li>
<li>a lightly incised circle, called an urna, appears between the eyes. The urna was an identifying mark of the Buddha’s divine status and ability to see beyond our realm.</li>
<li>Buddha has long earlobes that recall the heavy royal earrings he once wore</li>
<li>the second-century Bodhisattva Maitreya had a musculature markedly western/Greek</li>
</ul>
<p>The bodily attributes displayed in Buddhist sculpture varied only slightly</p>
<p>The Buddha is shown in his human shape because of his last incarnation in the human world, but particular bodily marks are witness to his transcendence of the human realm. After enlightenment, the historical prince Siddhartha Gautama acquired various marks (lakshana) that identify him as the Buddha.</p>
<p>The <strong>importance of the bodily attributes</strong> for any Buddha image in India and China can hardly be overestimated. Descriptions of these are formalized in the Buddhist canon, specifying 32 primary and 80 secondary superhuman attributes. For the most part, however, the local lists are homogenous.</p>
<p>The major bodily attributes of a Buddha are witness to his completion of awakening and are, therefore, the only adequate way to represent him in human form. The Buddha’s body is dignified, well proportioned, and extremely tall, with its slender and long limbs.  There is a top hair bump, and the hair is fashioned into tiny snail stylized curls. Another mark is the urna between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s earlobes are extended in reference to the heavy jewelry he wore previously as a prince. He wears a simple monk’s robe, in keeping with his spiritual purpose, and sits in a lotus position.</p>
<p>Fingers have all the same length, or special markings on the palms and on the soles of the feet. All parts of the Buddha’s body, even features that cannot be represented, like his voice, are determined by his being enlightened.</p>
<p>Often the face and the uncovered parts of the body were gilded, representing the light emitting from the Enlightened One’s body. His skin was said to be of a golden hue, emitting light from every single pore.</p>
<p>Other important attributes mentioned in the texts pertain to the meanings of his hands position, the mudras, which evoke ideas during Buddhist meditation or rituals:</p>
<ul>
<li>right hand over right knee (calling Earth as a witness to Enlightenment)</li>
<li>right hand held up with palm out (symbolizing giving reassurance, “no fear”)</li>
<li>hands held at chest with fingers turning invisible wheel (setting in motion the “wheel of the doctrine”—that is, preaching)</li>
<li>hands placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched palms facing upwards (“meditation mudra”)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathura was a sacred place for the followers of Jainism</strong> who sculpted their deities. The <strong>Mathura Buddhas </strong>are related to the earlier Indian yakṣa figures (male nature deity). This is a direct continuation of the old Indian art of Sanchi with few Gandharan elements facial types will establish the traits of the Buddha iconography:</p>
<ul>
<li>full of energy with broad shoulders, swelling chest</li>
<li>if standing the legs are firmly planted and spaced apart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mudras:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>left hand palm facing down in “calling earth as witness” mudra</li>
<li>often the right hand forms a mudra of “fearlessness” representing protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear; the left arm akimbo or resting on the thigh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warmer Climatic Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buddha’s torso is dressed with a transparent monk’s robe</li>
<li>a higher fluidity of the clothing</li>
<li>drapery is closely molding the body giving the illusion of nudity.</li>
<li>details tend to be less realistic, and more symbolic</li>
<li>radiant inner calm and stillness, the products of supreme wisdom</li>
<li>earlier the shaven head and the topknot of the head indicated by a tiered spiral</li>
</ul>
<p>Later Buddhas had shell-like hair curls, which became the standard representation throughout the Buddhist world. These Buddhas have ornate halos around the Buddha’s head, while in Gandharan art the aureole is plain.</p>
<ul>
<li>garments with lotus flower (symbol of purity) design</li>
<li>the presence of either the lion throne or the lotus throne.</li>
<li>the sitting Buddha images naturalistic pose with legs crossed</li>
<li>represented as powerful with broad shoulders and open eyes</li>
<li>more warmer climate adaptations: the right shoulder bare,</li>
</ul>
<p>Standing Buddhas tend to display characteristics and attitudes seen in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara:</p>
<ul>
<li>the clothing covers both shoulders, with symmetric folds</li>
<li>the left hand holds the gown of the Buddha while the other hand (Roman toga style)</li>
<li>the folds in the clothing are more typical of the Gandharan style</li>
</ul>

<p>A remarkable parallel can be drawn with the icon of Christ. The portrayal of his physical features follows the notion of a “delineation,” which places every human being into a coded system of particular features that establish a distinctive identity. The Patriarchs of the Byzantine stated that “The icon of a man is not inscribed according to nature, but according to position.” (Barber 2002). In other words, there was no doubt about what the historical, incarnated Christ “looked like,” because there was only one way in which he could have manifested physically in the world. Thus “an icon has to be seen as a living eyewitness of actual events.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<h4><strong>Natural and Spiritual</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>recognize symbolism and iconography of the natural and spiritual world in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>evaluate cross-cultural impact of religious and political themes</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>iconographic symbolism, natural motifs, and themes of human’s connection</strong> with both the <strong>natural and spirit world</strong> in <strong>Buddhism and Shindoism</strong> saturated non-religious art and reflected the continued impact from Silk Route and trade.</p>
<h5>China</h5>
<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism</strong>. Predating this are philosophies and historical texts that are based around nature and the cosmos. This later influenced Chinese Buddhism.</p>
<h5><strong>Neo-Confucianism in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Self − Qi + Li = Oneness</strong></p>
<p>Daoism and Confucianism were both prevalent ethical, philosophical, and religious systems in China when Buddhism was introduced. <strong>Neo-Confucianism merges the three philosophies</strong> and teaches that the universe consists of two interacting forces know as li, or idea, and qi, or matter, “The individual’s goal is to rid the qi of impurities through education and self-cultivation so that the li may realize its oneness with the Great Ultimate.”</p>
<h5><strong>Essence</strong></h5>
<p>Art, like monument landscape painting, expressed Neo-Confucian ideas visually. The artist’s goal was to paint the essence of the landscape, not to reproduce the appearance of it. The artist was required to understand all of the aspects of the li of the landscape and, therefore, would express the desire for the spiritual communion with nature that was the key to enlightenment.</p>

<p>In <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, Fan Kuan relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape, embracing Neo-Confucian ideas. Gaps between the tree distances function like pauses between the varying views.</p>
<p>Scale in the piece <strong>emphasizes the sense of vastness and space</strong>. The small trees and shrubs are dwarfed in light of the size of the mountain.</p>
<p>The painting, presenting universal creation in its totality, is an orderly statement reflecting the artist’s worldview. The essence of the landscape in <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, including the sense of vastness and space, supported viewers as they meditated while seeking spiritual communion with nature and, therefore, seeking enlightenment.</p>
<p>Silk was both a popular and valuable material, and it was able to be made in large pieces to support large, monument landscape paintings like <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>. At over seven feet high, the piece differs from the Japanese hand scrolls—small-scale secular paintings designed to be appreciated in private settings. These pieces differ in not only size but also subject. The hand scroll <strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> is an account of a battle, unlike the natural mountain view in <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Korea</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism came to Korea from China in the 4th century C.E. and carried with it symbolic themes of the natural and spirit world. Tombs of the Silla kingdom contained artworks representative of the wealth and power of its rulers.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Gold and jade crown</em></strong> is made of sheet gold, embossed along the edges, and is an example of the high level of skill among the artists in the Silla kingdom. This technique may have come from China.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1470" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1470" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?resize=600%2C681&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?w=298&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?resize=264%2C300&amp;ssl=1 264w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1470" class="wp-caption-text">Gold and jade crown<br />© DeA Picture Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gold rivets and wires secure the pieces of jade along the crown and horn-like projections. Jade is significant as it was both a symbol of the wealthy and elite, but it was also believed that it possessed magical qualities that could protect the dead. The projections are representative of tree and antler forms and are believed to symbolize life and supernatural power, suggesting the connection of nature to the supernatural world.</p>
<h5><strong>Japan</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>beauty of the changing seasons</strong> has always been <strong>celebrated by the people of Japan.</strong> Each season brings its own celebrations and festivals. This is also part of <strong>Shinto</strong>, Japan’s native belief system and indigenous religion. It has been preserved in and has been part of the everyday fabric of Japanese life.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine Shinto</strong> had a close relationship to the Imperial royal family and was both a religion and a state. <strong>Sect Shinto</strong> originated around the 19<sup>th</sup> century and has 13 major sects organized by the founder or systematizer. <strong>Folk Shinto</strong> is based on Japanese folk beliefs. All three are interrelate.</p>
<p><strong>Poetry and visual arts</strong> are part of Shinto. Kokinshu (A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern) is the first known works of Japanese poetry, and nature is the inspiration. Shinto paintings of the Heian period show Spring blossoms Autumnal leaves and winter scenes.</p>

<p>The work above, from the Metropolitan Museum is entitled <strong><em>Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons</em></strong>. It was painted in the late 16<sup>th</sup> century during the Momoyama period (1573-1615), in Japan. The work is a pair of six-panel folding screens with ink, color, gold, and gold leaf. The story moves from right to left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many paintings depict the <strong>transitioning of seasons</strong>. A theme in both Shinto and Buddhist art is the <strong>theme of beauty and brevity</strong>. For a more minute view of seasonal changes flowering plants and flowers become painting compositions.</p>

<p>Decorative arts were adorned in the same way. Think ceramics, lacquerware and even kimonos.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>In Japan, painting of landscape also incorporated varying techniques. In <strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong>, Ogata Korin used <strong>tarashikomi</strong>, which literally means “dripping in.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?resize=320%2C286&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="320" height="286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?resize=300%2C268&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2237" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?resize=318%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="318" height="287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Tarashikomi involves applying a second layer of paint before the first is dry. This results in a dripping form that creates fine details like ripples in water or leaves and is specifically used in <strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> to depict the tree trunks.</p>
<p>This painting, like <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape. The stream cuts through the center, giving the impression of expansion. The trees offer asymmetrical views. The white plum tree on the left is mostly outside of the screen, while the red plum tree on the right is mostly within the screen</p>
<h5>Gardens</h5>
<p><strong>Wet and dry gardens in Japan</strong> echo the connection of the natural and spirit world. They are designed to create both a sense of integration between the observer and nature and an atmosphere in which meditation can take place.</p>
<p><strong>Wet gardens</strong> contain stones, vegetation, and water, while <strong>dry gardens contain</strong> stones, vegetation, and representations of water. Water and stone represent opposites that complement and complete each other in Buddhist symbolism. The walled dry gardens at <strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> consist of 15 arranged stones on a raked bed of white sand, which is representative of water and purity.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2068" style="width: 572px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2068" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=572%2C381&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="572" height="381" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2068" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, wet garden<br />© John Lander Photography</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stones are carefully arranged in five groups so that the entire garden cannot be seen from the porch, and only 14 stones can be viewed from any other angle. The gardens were viewed as puzzles, or lessons, to promote study and meditation. Those who come to the garden to meditate believe that they will be able to see the 15th stone when they reach enlightenment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2202" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?resize=587%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="587" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?w=349&amp;ssl=1 349w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Scholars disagree about the stones’ meanings: some theorize that the stones represent islands in a stream or possibly peaks of mountains, others state that they have no meaning and are just an abstract composition that functions to incite meditation. Gazing at dramatic natural scenery was considered highly beneficial to the human spirit and helpful in gaining enlightenment</p>
<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism</strong>. Predating this are philosophies and historical texts that are based around <strong>nature and the cosmos</strong>. This later influenced <strong>Chinese Buddhism</strong>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these holy men were <strong>drawn to the mountains</strong> to establish temples. Mountains also appear in art as early as the Han Dynasty as a looming background within a variety of themes and idealized settings.</p>
<p><strong>Landscape paintings</strong> would become its own genre by the late Tang Dynasty. This would also become a major theme for poets.</p>
<h5><strong>Plants and Animals</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Animals, both real and imagined </strong>also made their way into Chinese art such as<strong> serpents, bovines, cicadas, dragons, and phoenixes, along with vegetation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dragons</strong> are symbolic of <strong>male energy</strong>, while<strong> phoenixes are symbolic of female energy</strong> and illustrate the connection of the natural and spirit world in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Painted designs and pictures on Chinese porcelain exemplify this. Porcelain resembles jade and, when fired, would have a translucent, shiny surface. It was, therefore, highly regarded like jade in Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In Daoism <strong>tigers represent the ying and dragons the yang.</strong> They were also considered a balance to one another as the tiger is from the real world and the dragon is from the imagined. The tigers appear in Buddhism as well, such as jataka tales with other Buddhist figures. The Chinese dragon was reimagined from Naga the Indian deity or god of snakes.</p>
<p>Animals are vividly portrayed in <strong>art from the ancient Near East</strong> and appear as part of ever day life. They appear in flocks, as pack animals for work and travel, in hunting scenes, and ridden in battle. Horses were of upmost importance as both transportation and warfare. These scenes appear on painted pottery, stone that has been carved and in metal works.</p>
<p><strong>Wild animals</strong> were portrayed as powerful. <strong>Lions guarded royal doorways</strong> during the Urak period. Other creatures such as vultures, foxes, and bulls were also prominently featured. Wings, claws, horns, and animals fighting were all elements that provoked thoughts of danger.</p>
<p>Many of these great <strong>animals were linked to gods</strong> such as the storm god Adad as the bull. Other gods appeared winged.</p>
<p><strong>Domesticated animals</strong> were popular accessories in the Near East. In fact, many were first domesticated here including dogs, cats, goats, sheep, and donkeys. Camels would come later in the first century A.D. These animals appeared in decorative arts and in amulets showing that they were considered lucky and protective</p>
<p>Animals also appeared in art as <strong>a sign of fertility</strong>, featured in pairs, families and mothers caring for there young. <strong>Animals appearing in repetitive sequencing symbolize abundance</strong>.</p>
<p>Animals were also used ritualistically and were sacrificed to the gods and part of ceremonial hunts. Through this association, animals in art were part of temples, as too were the vessels used in such ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>Works crafted from ivory</strong> became increasingly sought after and were a sign of the elite. Vast collections have been found in Neo-Assyrian palaces.</p>

<p><strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>is an example of<strong> decorative arts </strong>that is both beautiful and utilitarian. Made of  solid <strong>ivory</strong> from the tusk of an elephant, the work stands <strong>6 inches tall</strong>.  Ivory was expensive, durable, smooth, elegant, and easily carved, making it a highly desirable material. This pyxis was made from the famous workshop of Madinat al-Zahra</p>
<p>Islamic art is not always <strong>aniconic</strong>, meaning it does not use animal or human form. It is religiously <strong>aniconic</strong> only. In non-religious or secular and for private use, representational images can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong>: literally means “<em>fear of emptiness</em>” and refers to artwork that is completely full of imagery. This decorative work is an example of this. The work is dense, overcrowded, and intricate, with no space for recession.</p>

<h5><strong>Politically Utilitarian</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>was a gift to 18-year-old al-Mughira, son of a caliph, as a coming of age present. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is cylindrical box with a separate lid. The one has a <strong>utilitarian</strong> purpose, as it was used for cosmetics. Royal men wore makeup, particularly eye makeup, as a sign of status.</p>
<p><strong>Ivory objects were given to royalty</strong> on important occasions. Think marriage, birth, and coming of age.</p>
<p>Such works expresses the political authority of the Spanish Umayyads.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This work is decorated with four eight-lobed medallions. This is symbolism of the number eight. It represents the eight levels of Paradise. There are carved <strong>falconers, griffons, peacocks, birds, and animals to be hunted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Royal iconography</strong> includes courtly figures and lute players. <strong>Falcons</strong> were a symbol of Umayyad legitimacy and power. Date palm trees may allude to the lost Umayyad lands of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The <strong>two lions</strong> symbolizing the Umayyads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The inscription reads: “God’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Power and Symbolism in Nature</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>power and symbolism of nature</strong> is portrayed and perceived differently by different audiences. In <strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong>, nature is seen as dangerous and antagonistic.</p>
<p>Mt. Fuji, which is usually depicted as large and imposing, is small and dwarfed in the background compared to the wave. This change in the presentation of Mt. Fuji symbolizes the power of nature and its ability to conquer. Even a large and imposing mountain is dwarfed in the face of nature. Two boats with faceless passengers are about to be toppled by a huge, dragon claw-like wave. This demonstrates the dominance of nature, that it can overpower even the largest mountains and humankind.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura</em>)</strong>, is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai</strong>. This is a <strong>polychrome woodblock print created with ink and color on paper.</strong> <em><strong>Part of the Series: Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuj</strong></em>i it measures 10 by 14 inches.</p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as The Great Wave. Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5>Content</h5>
<p><em><strong>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> is a Japanese seascape <strong><em>Ukiyo-e print</em></strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The color palette is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> is a part of the series, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play, The Great Wave stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>The apparent symbolism <strong>points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the Ukiyo-e print represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by Hokusai. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, The Great Wave was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the ukiyo-e technique.</p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p>Hokusai has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term Ukiyo-e means the floating world, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. Ukiyo-e prints were recognized by their emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>
<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in The Great Wave.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><em><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> was created as one of the thirty-six prints by Japanese <strong><em>artist Katsushika Hokusai</em></strong>. Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in The Great Wave, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><em><strong>Setting</strong></em></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Political Emphasis</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Neo-Confucianism</strong> also had political emphasis. Families emphasized loyalty to the king as part of loyalty to the family, and this was echoed in artworks. <strong><em>The Portrait of Sin Sukju</em></strong> was a propagandistic painting on silk that demonstrated Sin Sukju as a powerful prime minister in Korea. It also contrasts the vegetal and landscape views in <strong><em>Travelers among Mountains and Stream</em></strong>s by using figural imagery, depicting Sin Power and Authority</p>

<h5><strong>Power and Authority</strong></h5>
<p>Power and authority were demonstrated by patrons <strong>through the sculptures of Buddha</strong> in both the <strong>Longmen caves and the Daibutsuden temple </strong>and in in the <strong>Todai-ji complex</strong>. Artwork and architecture is used to support government and political structure.</p>
<p>The<strong> Forbidden City</strong> in Beijing, China is an imperial palace compound and served not only as the home of emperors and their household but as the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government. Planned according to traditional Chinese principles, the city is walled and laid out on a rectangular grid with evenly spaced streets.</p>
<p>The balance and symmetry of the plan of the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> reflects ancient Chinese beliefs about the harmony of the universe and emphasize the emperor’s role as the Son of Heaven, whose duty was to maintain the cosmic order from his throne in the middle of the world. The monumental nature of the <strong>stone, marble, and brick connect with the demonstration of power and authority</strong>. This provides a distinct contrast when compared to Sukju without any surroundings.</p>

<p>The <strong>courtyard style residence</strong> uses a <strong>geometric organization</strong> of space that is aligned with the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>Outer court represented <strong>Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the South.</li>
<li>Belonged to realm of state affairs and only men had access to its spaces.</li>
<li>Included: emperor’s formal reception halls, places for religious rituals and state ceremonies.</li>
<li>Hall of Supreme Harmony represented central focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inner court represented <strong>Heaven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the North</li>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>Eastern and Western sides reserved for retired emperor and empress dowager</li>
<li>Also included <strong>Buddhist and Daoist temples</strong> building during Ming Dynasty</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>The symbolism shows the relationship between Heaven and Earth. Emperor is the Son of Heaven and can mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>Power is conveyed visually and there is a spatial representation of power. This shows the emperor’s power over laws and regulations since he can regulate and reorganize nature.</p>
<p>The architects followed ideal cosmic order and social hierarchy in Confucianism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The complex was to showcase Yongle’s magnificence during turbulent years after the overthrow of his nephew. It was a visual assertion of imperial power with ceremonial space, ritual space and living space.</p>
<p>It was named the <strong><em>Forbidden Palace</em></strong> because only royal court could enter.</p>
<p>The complex was a political and ritual center for China for 500+ years. It was a place of power and propaganda that legitimized rulers and became visual evidence for the Mandate of Heaven.</p>

<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 North Gate (Gate of Divine Might)</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some key points about the <strong>North Gate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walls are 30 feet high to keep people out</li>
<li>Designed to withstand cannons</li>
<li>Gate from which troops would often leave</li>
<li>3 openings: middle one was reserved for the emperor only</li>

<p>This gate has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five entryways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest in the center was used as passage for Ming and Qing emperors.</li>
<li>The side ones are smaller and were used for officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-eaved roof is guarded by two pairs of <strong>Ming stone lions.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Mao Zedong</strong></h5>
<p>Today the gate is characterized by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong weighing 1.5 tons. Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two placards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: Long Live the People’s Republic of China</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrases have significant meaning as <strong>“Long Live”</strong> was reserved for Emperors of China. But afterward it was available to common people because Mao had liberated it…just like Forbidden City!</p>
<p>In 1989, three dissidents attacked the portrait with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests. They were sent to prison for 17 years (released 2006).</p>

<p>The Emperor’s seat is in here and was meant for grand ceremonies such as enthronements and weddings. From here, the emperor could establish cosmic order and mediate between both worlds. This is the middle of the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>9 main bays wide and 9 dragons inside (9 is a special number)</li>
<li>Bureaucrats and officials would gather in front of the gate at 3 am waiting for the emperor to walk by at 5am.</li>

<p><strong>The Northeastern section </strong>was a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. He planned to retire and abdicate, then settle down in modest quarters here, along with his major art collection.</p>
<p>This part of the complex is called the <strong>Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service</strong> and this room is the theater room. The layout mirrors the arrangement of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The finest craftsmen of the day spent <strong>five years building</strong> just this palace. He never spent a night here.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the palace was chained shut and largely forgotten. It has now been restored to what was imagined it would have been like.</p>
<p>If he didn’t sleep here, what did he do here?</p>
<p>There were <strong>gardens, banquet rooms, prayer halls</strong>, an <strong>opera house,</strong> and a <strong>theater room</strong>. It was a place to <strong>meditate, write poetry</strong>, and <strong>enjoy company of concubines.</strong></p>
<p>It was a simple rectangular room with translucent <strong>embroidered scenes</strong>, <strong>jade-inlaid wall hangings</strong> and <strong>Chinese carved decoration. </strong>There were also panoramic <strong>murals painted on silk</strong>, <strong>wisteria painted on ceilings</strong>, along with <strong>magpies flying over the tiled rooves</strong> of the palace. This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l’oeil</strong>). This was a testament to the emperor’s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.</p>
<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ming</strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant</strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.</p>
<p>The construction of the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son’s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).</p>
<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.  The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China.</p>
<h4><strong>Idealism + Politics = Propaganda</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>propagandistic properties of artwork</strong> also demonstrate power and authority, and the power of governments to regulate artwork. In 1949, Mao Zhedong came to power in China and encouraged artists to create art that conveyed Communist ideas in methods that were accessible to the masses and the new Communist state of China.</p>

<p>The painting <strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> is an example of the multitude of realistic oil paintings of workers, soldiers, and peasants that resulted from his encouragement. These paintings replaced the traditional ink paintings of natural landscapes largely <strong>due to the strict regulation of artistic production in 1966.</strong></p>
<p>At this time, the Chinese government pushed a cultural revolution and sought to modernize itself by destroying anything that resembled tradition.</p>
<p>Many traditional artists were humiliated and tortured, and their artworks destroyed. Younger artists <strong>created works that would be distributed by the government</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> became one of the most popular images of the Cultural Revolution in China.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 7.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in West and Central Asian Art</strong></h5>
<p>The arts of West and Central Asia play a key role in the history of world art. Vast cultural interchanges have occurred in these lands that link the European and Asian peoples.</p>
<h5><strong>The Heart of the Silk Route</strong></h5>
<p>Historical cultures of <strong>West and Central Asia</strong> reside in a vast area that includes the <strong>Arabian Peninsula and the Levant, Anatolia, Greater Iran, Central Asia, Inner Asia, and Himalayan Asia</strong>. These regions have had shifting political boundaries throughout their histories and include lands associated with the former Soviet Union and modern China. They form the heart of the ancient Silk Route.  This connected the Greco-Roman world with China and India.</p>
<h5><strong>An Exchange of Cultural Ideas</strong></h5>
<p>Arts attest to the transmission and influence of cultural ideas, such as <strong>Islam </strong>and <strong>Buddhism</strong>. It also includes cultural art forms, such as <strong>Hellenistic architecture</strong>, <strong>Buddhist sculpture</strong>, <strong>chinoiserie</strong> (in Persian art), and <strong>ceramic-tile decoration</strong>.</p>
<p>Cross-cultural comparisons with the arts of these regions may be made most readily to the arts of the ancient Mediterranean; medieval Europe; and South, East, and Southeast. The arts of West and Central Asia had great international impact through trade.</p>
<h5><strong>The Domination of Textiles</strong></h5>
<p>Textiles were perhaps the most important art form in these regions and dominated much of the international trade between Europe and Asia.</p>
<h5><strong>Other Works</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic metalworks</strong>, including examples with Christian subject matter, were created for trade in the regions bordering the Mediterranean.</p>
<p><strong>Ceramics</strong> were another important trade item, particularly the Iznik wares created in TurkeyAsia.</p>
<p><strong>West Asian art</strong> finds its greatest source of refinement and international influence in the Persianate arts from the Timurid and Safavid dynasties of Iran, which influenced the Ottoman arts of Turkey and the Mughal arts of India. Styles of art in Central Asia can be divided into <strong>Persianate Islamic styles</strong>, which maintain developments made in West Asian art, and <strong>Indian inspired styles</strong>, which are characterized by the idealized figural art traditions of South Asia.</p>
<h5>Figural Art</h5>
<p>Use of figural art in religious contexts varies among traditions, whereas figural art is common in secular art forms across West and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Figural art is a primary form of visual communication in Buddhist communities in Central Asia, as it is across Asia. Figural imagery is used to depict <strong>Buddha</strong> and various attendants, teachers, practitioners, and deities. This is an <strong>iconic culture</strong>, and the presence of invoked figural imagery is important to Buddhist practices. These figures may be venerated in <strong>shrine settings</strong>, may inhabit conceptual <strong>landscapes </strong>and <strong>palaces</strong> of ideal Buddhist worlds, may be found in <strong>mandalas</strong>, or may be depicted in <strong>paintings</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Sacred Versus Secular Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic art</strong> that is created for <strong>religious purposes</strong> does not contain figural imagery. Mosque architecture is decorated with <strong>non figural imagery</strong>, including calligraphy, geometric, and vegetal forms. Manuscripts or objects containing sacred texts may contain calligraphy, illumination, or geometric and vegetal decoration, but should not contain figural imagery.</p>
<p>Figural art is an important subject of <strong>Islamic art in West and Central Asia</strong>. Islamic cultures draw a clear distinction between sacred and <strong>secular contexts</strong>. Figural imagery abounds in secular works, such as decorative arts and manuscript painting, which often depict sociological types, such as hunters or courtiers, or narrative subjects, such as the ancient kings and heroes of the Persian Shahnama.</p>
<p>Religious ideas or content are sometimes carried over into secular art forms and may be illustrated when they become the subject of courtly or popular literature and poetry. For example, the prophet Moses might be illustrated in the Khamsa of Nizami. Moses would not be illustrated, however, in the holy Qur’an.</p>

Architecture</p>
<p><strong>Petra</strong> is famous for its <strong>rock cut tombs</strong> built in what today is <strong>Jordan</strong>.  Here there are <strong>800 tombs</strong>, and <strong>3000 architectural elements</strong> carved from <strong>sandstone and limestone</strong>. Located in a rocky basin, Petra is accessed by a deep road called Siq. Geographically, the site is located 150 miles south of both Amman, the capital of Jordan and Jerusalem.</p>
<h5><strong>Background History</strong></h5>
<p>The Nabatean people had settled in southern Jordan by 312 BCE.  Ideally placed at the Northern end of the Caravan Route that ran from South Arabia to the Mediterranean, the people were great traders during the late Hellenistic and Early Roman Periods. The commerce of luxury products such as frankincense and myrrh, that was burned at alters, as well as spice, contributed to a wealthy society.</p>
<p>The <strong>Romans </strong>invaded during 106 CE and changed the name to Arabia Petrae. Here, they ruled for 250 years, until an earthquake destroyed the buildings. The <strong>Byzantines </strong>would take control later and govern for another 300 years. Petra was mostly abandoned however, by the eight century CE.</p>
<p>Referred to as the Rose City, because of the color the stone appears, Petra was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 1985.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Initially, historians thought Petra was a large necropolis or cemetery. The architecture proves otherwise, uncovering what was once an active and well-developed metropolis.</p>
<p>With talented architects the community transformed the rocky desert into a great city through innovative constructions. Engineers turned the dusty land into a garden oasis by using an elaborate water system through damming, terracing, and irrigation. This was used to harvest, store, and distribute water collected during the rainy season.</p>
<h5><strong>The Treasury Façade</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_1450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1450" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1450" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/181-Petra-B.jpg?resize=600%2C721&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="721" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1450" class="wp-caption-text">Treasury<br />© Bernard Gagnon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most famous building is the <strong>Treasury (or Khazneh)</strong>. It measures 249 meters wide by 38.77 meters high.</p>
<p>The façade contains both Hellenistic, and Near Eastern architecture. As the city grew it was influenced by trade and culture of Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines.</p>
<p>Architectural features include broken <strong>pediment </strong>with two <strong>obelisks</strong> above reaching into the rocks. There are ornate <strong>Corinthian columns</strong> throughout. There is also a circular building at the top called a <strong>tholos</strong>.</p>
<p>Sculptural works on the lower level include the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, known to protect both travelers and the dead.  The upper levels house Amazons and Victories around an unidentified female goddess.</p>
<p>Other symbols include eagles, vines, vegetation, and vases with large handles, known as <strong>kantharoi</strong>. The rosettes are associated with the Ancient Near East.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: The Treasury at Petra appeared in the movie <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. </em></p>
<h5><strong>Great Temple</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_1451" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1451" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1451" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/181-Petra-C.jpg?resize=880%2C564&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="880" height="564" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/181-Petra-C.jpg?w=437&amp;ssl=1 437w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/181-Petra-C.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1451" class="wp-caption-text">Great Temple<br />© Bernard Gagnon</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The Great Temple</strong> at Petra is the largest freestanding building that has been excavated at the site. The temple precinct has a formal entry or Propylaeum, a Lower Temenos, or sacred enclosure. To access the Upper Temenos, there are two sets of stairs. These are located both east and west.</p>
<p>The temple continued to thrive well into the Roman period. It stopped being used following the devastating earthquake that struck Petra in 363 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>The Painted Biclinium</strong></h5>
<p>This monument is named for the benches that are carved out along two walls. The painting on the ceiling of the alcove, a rare glimpse of this medium in Nabatean culture, is an intricate creation of grapevines, flowers, birds, and cherubs. The interior also has drawings of Roman gods, including the son of Venus, Cupid.</p>

<p><strong>Buddha </strong>in <strong>Bamiyan, Afghanistan</strong> was one of two <strong>rock cut</strong> Buddhas fashioned with <strong>plaster, polychrome, and paint.</strong>  The largest stood <strong>150 feet tall</strong>. They were destroyed in 2001.</p>
<p>The main bodies were hewn directly from the sandstone cliffs. The stone was <strong>in situ</strong> and <strong>living rock</strong>. The details were modeled in mud, mixed with straw, coated with stucco. <strong>Gold and fine jewels</strong> were added These were gifts and offerings from pilgrims.</p>
<p>The <strong>niches</strong> are shaped like mandorlas to emphasize the statues. This also acts as protection from the elements such as rain, wind, and sun.</p>
<p>The works were an <strong>appropriation of Greek and Asian artforms.</strong> The <strong>Asian influence</strong> could be seen in the body form, facial features, and size. The <strong>Greek influence</strong> was present in the drapery and folds.</p>
<p>There is no knowledge of patron, artist, or details of the commission.</p>

<p>The <strong>larger Buddha</strong> was painted with a red robe and depicted as <strong>Vairocana</strong> Buddha who embodies all wisdom. This type of Buddha must be depicted as grand in size as it is a very masculine form of Buddha.</p>
<p>The <strong>smaller Buddha</strong> was painted with a blue robe and known as a historical Buddha. It may represent female aspects and as such is smaller.</p>
<p>The <strong>cave galleries</strong> are painted with wall paintings and images of Buddha. Pilgrims can walk through these caves.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Gandharan</strong> was a diverse culture that emerged in Afghanistan. It was influenced by Alexander the Great’s Greek empire, Buddhism from the Silk Roads, and Indian kingdoms.</p>
<p><strong>Bamiyan</strong> was a <strong>caravanserai</strong>, a “highway town” of sorts for travelers on the Silk Road that connected China to the Mediterranean. The area contained numerous Buddhist sanctuaries. By the 7<sup>th</sup> century, there were 5,000 plus monks and pilgrims in Bamiyan.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhism</strong> is not location-specific, focuses on an afterlife, and is not class-specific. it can be worshipped anywhere and spread easily among traders. Mahayana Buddhism spread due to Chinese expansion westward. It developed a concept of Buddha as an incarnation of wisdom and truth. This meant Buddha was literally larger than life. As such, monumental statuary of Buddha emerged.</p>
<h5><strong>Timeline</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong>1221 CE, </strong>Ghengis Khan conquered this region of Afghanistan killing everyone but left the sculptures</p>
<p>Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, who was Muslim, tried to destroy the statues in the <strong>17<sup>th</sup> century.</strong></p>
<p>In March <strong>2001</strong> the Taliban, who determined these works were idols, dynamited and destroyed them.</p>

<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> sits on the highest point of old <strong>Jerusalem, Palestine. </strong>It is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong> with a <strong>wooden roof</strong> decorated with <strong>glazed ceramic tile, mosaics</strong>, and <strong>gilt aluminum</strong> and <strong>bronze dome</strong>. The dome measures <strong>67 feet</strong> on each side, plus 67 feet for the width of dome, and the same measurement for the height of drum.</p>

<p>The domed wooden octagonal building is <strong>centrally planned </strong>with <strong>two</strong> <strong>ambulatories</strong> that encircle the stone in the middle. The <strong>first ambulatory</strong> has 16 columns in its arcade. The <strong>second ambulatory</strong> has 24 columns in its arcade.

<h5><strong>Entering Paradise</strong></h5>
<p>In Islam, there are <strong>8 levels of Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>8 x 2 = 16</p>
<p>8 x 3 = 24</p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Influences</strong></h5>
<p>At the time Islam was a very new religion and determined its artist influences cross culturally.</p>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock was </strong>Influenced by <strong>Byzantine</strong> centrally planned buildings like San Vitale. They also borrowed the Byzantine tradition of <strong>mosaic work</strong>.  Mosaics on this building use <strong>tessellation</strong> or polygonal shapes that repeat without gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Roman influence</strong> can be seen in <strong>mausolea</strong>, (burial places for Roman emperors were circular) and the <strong>Roman dome</strong> (Pantheon). They were also Influenced by <strong>columns</strong> taken from Roman monuments (<strong>spolia</strong>) and the <strong>arcade</strong>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Coptic</strong> traditions of present-day Egypt and Syria, include its geometric motifs. <strong>Sassanian</strong> metal work was borrowed from what is present day Iran.</p>
<h5><strong>Pure Geometry</strong></h5>

<p>All decoration is <strong>aniconic</strong> meaning it is nonrepresentational and purely geometric . Here is why.</p>
<p>Muslims believed that <strong>mathematics</strong> was an indication that God controlled and had created the entire universe. <strong>Tessellations </strong>and mathematical designs help to reinforce this idea.</p>
<p>Muslims took the second commandment very strictly. It reads, “Thou shalt have no graven images”.  This was interpreted by Muslims as meaning there should not be anything representational in any religious art whatsoever</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Original function still debated – but it is a shrine, NOT a mosque</li>
<li>Symbol of caliphate strength</li>
<li>Testament to the power of the new Islamic faith</li>
<li>Pilgrimage site: Muslim pilgrims circumambulate the rock at the center of the building</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>

<ul>
<li>Jews believe this was the site for the beginning of the world</li>
<li>Adam was buried (or some say made) here</li>
<li>Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac here</li>
<li>Muhammad went on his “night journeys” here (Angel Gabriel took him to visit heaven, Moses, Christ, paradise and hell, and God)</li>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> is the earliest surviving Islamic building. It was created during the Umayyad period and the 1<sup>st</sup> caliphate of Islam.</p>
<p>It was built under the patronage of Abd al-Malik, who was the most important Umayyad caliph,  in the midst of a civil war</p>
<p>Whether there was a Byzantine church on this site, or near it, is still debated. Yet the Byzantine church style was still a huge influence on this building.</p>

<p><strong>Folio from a Qur’an </strong>was created with <strong>ink, color,</strong> and <strong>gold</strong> on <strong>parchment paper. </strong>The paper was costly and made from sheep or goat skin.  The work measures <strong>12 inches wide. </strong></p>
<p>The word <strong>folio</strong> simply means a <strong>page in a book</strong>. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p>The page uses <strong>calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used by early scribes is known as <strong>Kufic. </strong>This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>
<p>The <strong>text</strong> is written in brown ink and reads from right to left. <strong>Vowels</strong> are the red dots that are placed above or below a letter. <strong>Titles</strong> of the passage are written in gold ink and surrounded by a decorative rectangle.</p>
<p>Imagery is <strong>aniconic </strong>and features <strong>arabesques. </strong>Artists relied on vegetal and geometric motifs.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-835" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=990%2C572&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="572" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?w=567&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 7.2 Purpose and Audience in West and Central Asian Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>West Asia</strong> is the cradle of arts produced in regions with <strong>a dominant Islamic culture.</strong> These arts may be <strong>religious or secular in nature</strong> and may or may not have been made by or for Muslims. The term “Islamic art” may be applied to these diverse art forms. Many examples of Islamic art from across the traditional Islamic lands share similarities in terms of their content and visual characteristics.</p>
<h5><strong>The Pilgrimage </strong></h5>
<p>Pilgrimage is an important religious practice in Islam and Buddhism and is a key focus of several monuments and artworks in West and Central Asia including the <strong>Kaaba, </strong>the most sacred site in Islam; the <strong>Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem</strong>; and the <strong>Buddha sculpture Jowo Rinpoche</strong>, considered the most sacred image in Tibet.</p>
<h5><strong>The Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>The arts of West and Central Asia were created for and acquired by various kinds of local and global patrons. Audiences for these works included royal and wealthy patrons, lay and monastic religious practitioners, and foreign collectors who acquired works through gift or trade.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Architecture in West and Central Asia is frequently religious in function. West and Central Asia is home to many important <strong>Islamic mosques</strong>, which are decorated with non figural imagery, including calligraphy and vegetal forms.</p>
<p>All mosques have a Qibla wall, which faces the direction of Mecca, home of the Kaaba. This wall is ornamented with an empty <strong>mihrab</strong>, serving as a niche for prayer. A large congregational mosque may also include a <strong>minbar </strong>or pulpit for the imam, as well as a <strong>minaret</strong> and a central courtyard to call and accommodate practitioners for prayer.</p>
<p>Other important forms of Islamic religious architecture include <strong>commemorative monuments</strong>, such as the Kaaba and the Dome of the Rock, and tomb architecture. Central Asia is further recognized for its outstanding <strong>Buddhist cave architecture</strong>, which incorporates relief carving, constructive sculpture, and wall painting. In the Tibetan lands, <strong>Buddhist architecture</strong> flourishes in the form of stupas and monastic architecture.</p>

Site-specific</p>
<p><strong>The Kaaba </strong>located in <strong>Mecca, Saudi Arabia</strong>, is the holiest shrine in Islam.</p>
<p>Made from <strong>granite masonry, </strong>it is covered with<strong> silk curtain </strong>and<strong> calligraphy in gold and silver-wrapped thread. </strong>The silk curtain also known as <strong>kiswa</strong>, is replaced annually during the hajj. The monument measures <strong>43 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kaaba</strong> is the Arabic word for <strong>cube or square building.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Renovations and Additions</strong></h5>
<p>The structure has been <strong>renovated multiple times</strong>, and so has the surrounding mosque. <strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been set on fire and survived floods.  The black stone has been broken and reassembled with silver. The last major modifications were carried out in the 1950s by the government of Saudi Arabia to accommodate the increasingly large number of pilgrims who come on the hajj. Today the mosque covers almost 40 acres.</p>
<p>The <strong>door</strong> made of <strong>solid gold</strong> was added in 1982.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, is a large open space with <strong>colonnades on four sides</strong> and <strong>seven minarets</strong>, the largest number of any mosque in the world. At the center of this large plaza sits <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as well as many other holy buildings and monuments.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This important structure orients all mosques in the world. EVERY mosque is faced towards <strong>The Kaaba</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Prayer </strong></h5>
<p>Muslims <strong>pray</strong> <strong>five times per day</strong>. This is one of the five pillars of the faith.  These prayers are directed toward <strong>Mecca</strong> and <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as they have been since 624 CE. All mosques are marked with a <strong>qibla</strong> to know in which direction they need to pray.</p>

<p>Pilgrimage to a holy site is a core principle of almost all faiths. All Muslims aspire to undertake the hajj, or the annual pilgrimage, to <strong>The Kaaba</strong> once in their lives. This is another fundamental principle of the faith.</p>
<p>Once in Mecca, pilgrims gather in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram around <strong>The Kaaba</strong>. They then walk around <strong>The Kaaba.</strong> The goal is to kiss and touch the <strong>Black Stone</strong>—al-Hajar al-Aswad—embedded in the eastern corner.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> is a square building with a small interior room. Placed on the corner is the <strong>Black Stone </strong>which is the only original piece that remains on the site.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>According to tradition, the first building was <strong>built by Old Testament figure Abraham (known as Ibrahim in Islamic) and his son. </strong>Abraham’s son with his servant Hagar was Ismail. It is believed to be a structure that Abraham and his son Ismail created. It was built close to where Hagar found water.</p>
<p>The original sanctuary was a simple roofed rectangular structure. It housed the <strong>Black Stone</strong> (given to Abraham by the angel Gabriel) and statues of pagan gods.</p>
<p>The site was a <strong>pre-Islamic</strong> pilgrimage run by the Qaresh tribe, to which Muhammad belonged.</p>
<p>It was rebuilt it in 608 CE with masonry and wood. A door was included above ground level to protect the interior from intruders and flood waters.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When <strong>Muhammad</strong> successfully and captured Mecca in <strong>630 CE</strong>, he claimed the building for Islam and appropriated it. He also cleansed <strong>The Kaaba</strong> of its pagan god statues</li>
<li><strong>634-644 CE:</strong> second caliph Umar expanded the area around <strong>The Kaaba</strong> to accommodate more pilgrims</li>
<li><strong>644-656:</strong> third caliph Uthman built colonnades around the plaza where <strong>The Kaaba</strong> stands</li>
<li><strong>683 CE:</strong> <strong>The Kaaba</strong> was set on fire during a civil war
<ul>
<li><strong>The Black Stone</strong> broke into three pieces and was reassembled with silver</li>
<li><strong>The Kaaba</strong> was rebuilt in wood and stone and the space around it was paved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>By end of 7<sup>th</sup> century</strong>, <strong>The Kaaba</strong> was covered with <strong>kiswa</strong> a black cloth that is replaced annually during hajj.</li>
<li><strong>705-715 CE</strong>: Umayyad caliph al-Walid decorated the mosque that encloses <strong>The Kaaba</strong> with mosaics</li>
<li><strong>16<sup>th</sup> century</strong>: Ottomans heavily renovated the site (Suleyman I and Selim II)</li>
<li><strong>1631</strong>: <strong>The Kaaba</strong> and mosque were entirely rebuilt after floods had demolished them</li>
</ul>
<p>***Today, only Muslims may visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jowo Rinpoche </em></strong>is made from <strong>gilt metals</strong> with <strong>semiprecious stones, pearls</strong>, and <strong>paint</strong> as well as <strong>items from various offerings</strong>. It is believed to have been brought to Tibet in 641 CE. Today, the <strong>5-foot-tall</strong> sculpture sits in the <strong>Jokhang Temple, Lhasa, Tibet</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally,  the sculpture was in the style of <strong>Nirmanakaya </strong>which was simple and unadorned. But it was transformed into a <strong>Sambhogakaya</strong> or adorned sculpture because of all the offerings made to it.</p>
<p>The temples’ interior is a dark labyrinth of chapels and hallways.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the <strong>holiest object in Tibet. </strong>Since it represents the Buddha, it is believed to be Buddha’s proxy. It is based on what Buddha looked like when he was 12 and it was made during his lifetime. As such, it is an important pilgrimage destination for Tibetan Buddhists. They must take a pilgrimage here if they are able and three major pilgrimage routes dead end here.</p>
<p>This object is said to bestow freedom from fear and suffering, can grant wishes and quickens the path to enlightenment.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Process for Pilgrims </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Before entering, pilgrims circumambulate the temple to create good spiritual energy</li>
<li>Inside the temple, pilgrims make their way to the central shrine, often crawling on their hands or sliding on their bellies.</li>
<li>They hum prayers while bringing offerings.</li>
<li>When they reach <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong>, they pray in front of it and give offerings</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jowo</strong> means <strong>Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rinpoche</strong> means <strong>precious one</strong></p>
<p><strong>Khang</strong> means <strong>house </strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This is the sacred image of <strong>Buddha at age 12</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urna</strong>: spiral or circular red dot on the forehead of Buddhist images</li>
<li>Stretched earlobes (previously as a prince, Buddha wore huge earrings that stretched out his ears)</li>
<li>Believed to be based off Buddha himself</li>
<li>Face is of inner focus and patience.</li>
<li>The meditative pose in lotus position signifies enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The temple was founded in 647 CE by King Gampo, 1<sup>st</sup> ruler of unified Tibet who imposed Buddhism. The Queen was Queen Wencheng, daughter of the Tang Chinese emperor. She is credited with bringing Buddhism to Tibet when she married King Gampo in 641 CE. Part of her dowry was the <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong>.</p>
<p>On her way to Tibet from China, her wagon got stuck in the mud. This was interpreted as the Jowo Rinpoche wanting to stay on that spot, so construction began on a temple. Every day when workers returned to the site, the construction they had done the previous day had been undone. This continued for 6 years!</p>
<p>Finally, a divination revealed that an ancient demoness was sleeping in the earth under the exact spot where they were building the temple. Every night, she would push her arms and legs, while thrashing around, wrecking the construction on the temple. To stop this, <strong>the main</strong> <strong>Jokhang Temple</strong> was built on her heart to weigh her down and prove Buddhism’s supremacy, and <strong>ten smaller temples</strong> were built around Jokhang Temple to hold down her arms and legs.</p>

<p><strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>in <strong>Isfahan, Iran,</strong> is made from <strong>stone, brick, wood, plaster</strong>, and <strong>glazed ceramic tile.</strong> It is positioned in the center of the old city. Since it was enlarged and added on to for many years, it shares walls with surrounding buildings and is an odd shape.</p>
<p>This is the second of <strong>three mosque styles</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hypostyle Hall</li>
<li><strong>Four-iwan</strong></li>
<li>central plan</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Four-iwan Mosque Style</strong></h5>
<p>This style of mosque, of which <strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>is a prime example, has a large courtyard with four open vaulted rooms or <strong>iwans</strong> open to the courtyard.  This courtyard contains water. On holy days, Muslims <strong>must wash their hands and feet before entering a mosque.</strong></p>

<p>The four <strong>iwans</strong> are framed by <strong>pishtaqs</strong>. These are rectangular frames around pointed arched openings. Iwans help to bring light and ventilation into what would otherwise be dark rooms.</p>
<h5><strong>Blue</strong></h5>
<p>Use of <strong>blue colored tile</strong> in mosaic tessellations is very distinctive for <strong>Safavid</strong> architecture. It uses  aniconic imagery since this is a mosque. Notice the curving, decorative lines, or <strong>arabesques. </strong>These are used as a veneer over a brick core.</p>

<h5><strong>The Ogival Arch</strong></h5>
<p>The architecture uses the pointed arch, an influence that comes from the Christian West. This arch is  often called an <strong>ogival arch</strong> since it pinches slightly at the top.</p>
<h5><strong>Qiblah Iwan</strong></h5>
<p>This is the location of the <strong>mihrab</strong>. It is the only one marked with two <strong>minarets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Muezzin</strong> will call people to prayer from the minarets</li>
<li>Reserved for use by rulers</li>
<li>Constructed in 1310 by Mongols (Ilkhanid) rulers</li>
<li>Can see the <strong>minbars</strong> (short flight of steps used as a platform by a preacher in a mosque)</li>
<li>Iwan is filled with <strong>muqarnas </strong>(3D triangle that curls out towards you; layered over one another to make the interior of an arch grow out <strong>towards you)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh)</strong> is a mosque for personal prayer, worship, and contemplation.</p>

<p>It is also the center of community and a way of bringing people together and facilitating community. The courtyard creates a tranquil space with water where the viewer can sit and relax.</p>
<p>The mosque was connected to several pedestrian walkways originally. This facilitated not only public mobility but also commercial activity in connection to the mosque, as it was located near a large market.</p>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Isfahan was the capital of the Seljuk Turk empire</li>
<li>The mosque was expanded upon for a period of 1,000 years (8<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries)</li>
<li>In 700 CE, it was just a small mosque with the courtyard</li>
<li>11<sup>th</sup> century: core structure of the 4-iwan model was added by Seljuk Turks (under the reign of Malik Shah I, ruled 1072-1092)</li>
<li>Later rulers constantly expanded it (Mongol period – Ilkhanid; Timurid; Safavid</li>

<p><strong><em>The Court of Gayumars, </em></strong><strong>folio from Shah Tahmasp’s <em>Shahnama</em> </strong>is a work comprised of ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on fine paper. The borders are sprinkled with gold. The <strong>285 illuminations</strong> took three years to complete. The lead artist on the project was <strong>Sultan Muhammad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>This work is also known as <strong><em>The Court of the Kayumars</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Lavishly Crafted</strong></h5>
<p>This type of lavish illumination is typical of Persian art.</p>
<p>Other characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lively treatment of landscapes that look energetic and active</li>
<li>Vibrancy of color (jewel-like)</li>
<li>Impeccable detail (painted with a brush made of squirrel hair)</li>
<li>Illustration that is boxed onto the page with foliage that grows out and beyond it</li>
<li>Text that is relegated to captions only</li>
<li>Borders are decorated with gold leaf</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This copy of Shahnama was made for Shah Tahmasp the Safavid ruler. He was also the ruler when the Ardabil Carpet was made</p>
<p>This was <strong>given as a gift</strong> to the Ottoman sultan Selim II&#8211;who constructed Mosque of Selim II. This was indicative of the <strong>status</strong> of both men, given the lavish construction and expense. It was also a <strong>symbol of good taste. </strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The Shahnama</em></strong> narrates the history of Persian kings from mythical beginnings to Arab conquest.</p>
<p><strong>Gayumars</strong> was the legendary first king of Iran, associated with the beginning of civilization and an organized social order. The book displayed the political stability and longevity of Persian kings and Gayumars.</p>
<p>Gayumars and his people lived in the mountains and wore court attire of leopard skins. The court was prosperous. They are shown sitting amongst the mountains in their leopard skins. Gayumars was blessed with divine power and so he could control animals and humans.</p>
<p>Gayumars had a <strong>son</strong>, Siyamak who is on the <strong>right</strong> in the image. His <strong>grandson</strong> Hushang sits in the <strong>left</strong>.</p>

<p>Enter jealous mountain creature named Ahriman who did not like Gayumars or Siyamak. Murder ensues with Ahriman’s son, the Black Div, murdering Siyamak. This makes Gayumars’ grandson, Hushang, the next king.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">This text is considered one of the highest achievements of calligraphy and painting from the Safavid period.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Safavid Golden Age had begun! One of the hallmarks of the Persian Safavid tradition was manuscript production</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artist Notes</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sultan Muhammad</strong> was lead artist, but he was also part of a major school of artists called the <strong>Tabriz School. </strong>In this case the word “Sultan” means Master.</p>

<h5>TOPIC 7.1 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in West and Central Asian Art</h5>
<p>The arts of <strong>West and Central Asia</strong> provide evidence of the cultural transfer of ideas and art forms throughout this region. The presence of <strong>Hellenistic architecture</strong>, <strong>Buddhist sculpture</strong>, <strong>ceramic tile decoration</strong>, and <strong>chinoiserie</strong> outside of their original areas of development are each illustration of this cultural transfer.</p>
<p>Many of these works were <strong>created for</strong> a specific <strong>religiously affiliated purpose, patron, or audience</strong>. They play a key role in the history of world art, serving as an example of the vast cultural interchanges that link European and Asian peoples. <strong>Ceramics, metalwork, textiles, painting, and calligraphy</strong> are some of the materials, processes, and techniques employed by artists in these regions and cultures. This unit illustrates the importance and influence that these different materials and techniques had on art and art making within and across cultures.</p>
<h5><strong>Ceramics</strong></h5>
<p>Ceramic arts have flourished in West Asia since the prehistoric era. Many technical advancements in this media, such as the development of <strong>lusterware </strong>and <strong>cobalt-on-white slip painting</strong>, started there. Ceramic arts were used to create <strong>utilitarian vessels</strong> and <strong>elaborate painted and mosaic-tile</strong> architectural decoration, carrying forward artistic practices explored in ancient West Asia (the Near East).</p>
<p>High points in West and Central Asian ceramics include Persian <strong>mosaic tile architecture</strong> from the Seljuk through the Safavid dynasties, as seen in the <strong>Great Mosque of Isfahan</strong>, and <strong>Iznik tile work</strong> and export <strong>ceramics</strong> created during the Ottoman dynasty.</p>
<h5><strong>Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p>Metalwork and metallurgy flourished in West and Central Asia in the creation of <strong>metal plaques, vessels, arms, armor and tack, sculpture</strong>, and <strong>decorative objects</strong> of all kinds. Islamic metalwork is widely regarded as one of the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world.</p>
<p><strong>Metal sculpture</strong> was an important art form in Central Asian and Himalayan Buddhist art, which created Buddhist figures in <strong>bronze, copper, brass</strong>, and <strong>silver</strong>, and often ornamented them with <strong>gilding, metal</strong> <strong>inlay</strong>, and <strong>paint</strong>. Metal artworks were created through various processes including <strong>casting, beating, chasing, inlaying, and embossing.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Textile</strong></h5>
<p>Textile forms from this region include <strong>silk-tapestry weaving</strong>, <strong>silk velvets</strong>, and <strong>wool and silk carpets</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Painting in West and Central Asia usually took three forms—<strong>wall painting</strong>, <strong>manuscript painting</strong>, and in the Himalayan regions, the <strong>painting of</strong> <strong>thangkas, </strong>or large paintings on cloth, of Buddhist deities and mandalas.</p>
<h5><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h5>
<p>Calligraphy was a prominent art form, particularly in Islamic art in West Asia where beautiful forms were created to transmit sacred texts. Calligraphy is found on <strong>architecture, decorative arts objects</strong>, and <strong>ceramic tiles</strong>, as well as in <strong>manuscripts</strong> written on paper, cloth, or vellum.</p>
<h5><strong>The Style</strong></h5>
<p>Styles of art from West Asia tend to favor <strong>two-dimensional design</strong>. Often highly decorative, these works employ geometric and organic forms and vegetal designs. These qualities carry over into figural works, where figures inhabit flat or shallow spaces with tipped perspectives and patterned landscapes.</p>

<p><strong>Basin <em>(Baptistère de St. Louis</em>) </strong><strong>Muhammad ibn al-Zain </strong>measures <strong>20 inches wide</strong> and is made with <strong>brass </strong>and <strong>inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p>Brass is a mix of copper and zinc. For a work to be inlaid with silver and gold, it requires delicate hammering. Artists used the combination of metals to provide contrast and emphasis and to allow the viewer to see the figures easier. The entire work in decorated, even inside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-835" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=700%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="405" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?w=567&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Original Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended for a wealthy Muslim courtly secular audience. It was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk as a banqueting vessel or basin for handwashing.</p>
<h5><strong>Eventual Function</strong></h5>
<p>Somehow this work ended up in France. It was used during the 17<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> centuries to baptize French royal children (<strong>appropriation</strong>) although the association with St. Louis is probably fictional.</p>
<p>WHY would the French royalty be okay using an Islamic object to BAPTIZE French ROYAL children? The answer is unknown, as is the answer to how the Basin ends up in French royal hands</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Since this was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk, it probably depicts specific individuals and Mamluk battles. <strong>Iconography </strong>is very dense and complex. It has not been interpreted much by historians and the meanings are probably lost</p>
<p>The <strong>exterior</strong> has four figures in roundels, each on horseback. Two are hunting. One is drawing a bow and arrow. One is holding a club. These may be personifications of the different aspects of Mamluk horsemanship. There are Mamluk officials, macebearers, ax-bearers, and bow-bearers.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom bands</strong> are registers of animals that decorate the basin.</p>
<p>The common symbol is the <strong>fleur de lys</strong>. Ultimately this became the symbol of the French family, which may explain the use by the French, but this was also the symbol of the Mamluk sultans.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mamluks</strong> were warrior slaves in Egypt who took control of several Muslim regions. They established a <strong>dynasty from Egypt to Syria from 1250-1517</strong> when Ottomans conquered them.</p>
<p>Political and military dominance led to wealth which led to a flourishing artistic culture known for brass.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bahram Gur Fights the Karg</em></strong><em>, </em>a <strong>folio</strong> from the <em>Great Il-Khanid Shahnama, </em>is a work in ink and opaque watercolor, using gold and silver on paper, measuring 8 by 5.5 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>This is real paper. The knowledge of how to make this was this diffused from China through the Mongol Empire.</p>
<p>There are <strong>57 surviving illustrations </strong>all created with a vibrancy of colour that depict characteristics of the Ilkhanid (Mongol) period of manuscripts. The pages are large in format and the space is often entirely painted or decorated.</p>
<p>Figures are monumental compared to the landscape, which means there is a  low horizon line. Both are stylized. Atmospheric perspective is used. There is a heavy use of black line for contouring. Text and drawing are combined on the pages.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>manual </strong>for royal conduct of Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire (like Machiavelli’s The Prince). It is a  sign of Mongol leaders’ worldliness and sophistication. The <strong>cross-cultural influences</strong> show acceptance, interest in trade and diffusion.</p>
<p>It is a work <strong>propaganda</strong> that links the Mongols to the great lineage of Persian rulers. Since this is a Shahnama that the Mongols commissioned, it illustrates that the Mongols are trying to liken themselves to the Persian rulers in this text by showing it is of interest to them. Mongols were foreign rulers, so this was especially important.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of this book were made. It is assumed that it was commissioned by a high-ranking member of the Ilkhanid court</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shahnama (Book of Kings)</strong> is a compilation of stories about Persian/Iranian rulers, originally from 1010. It tells the stories of ancient heroes and kings Pre-Islamic Iran. It is based on truth but aggrandized and some parts are fictional and sensationalized. Full of adventure, romance, and a guide to ethics, the  good kings are lauded.</p>
<p>One of the kings in the text is Bahram Gur. As Sassanian King from 430-438 CE. He wears a robe of European fabric to slay a fearsome horned wolf (the Karg). The setting shows influence from Chinese landscapes</p>
<h5><strong>Importance of Illustrated Books</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Illustrated books</strong> were a very important art form in Iran. It flourished  during a cultural Golden Age led by the Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire. This was the Mongol Empire in the Middle East.  Manuscript illumination was highly prized by Mongols.</p>
<p>The Mongols ruled as foreigners in a conquered land. They employed words and images to legitimize their rule and by linking themselves with great native Persian rulers of the past?</p>
<h5><strong>Diversity of Court</strong></h5>
<p>Mongol court was very diverse and cross-cultural, and this influence ended up in artwork. much of this diversity and cross-cultural influence ended up in the artwork. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persian story of Shahnama</li>

<p><strong>Museum</strong>: Albert and Victoria Museum, London, with a twin carpet at Los Angeles County Museum</p>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet,</strong> from <strong>Iran</strong>, is made from <strong>silk </strong>warps and wefts with <strong>wool </strong>pile. The wool was added because it naturally absorbs dyes, which are all natural come from items such as pomegranates and indigo. Rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, natural arabesques make for a stunning carpet.</p>
<p>The carpet measures <strong>34 by 17 feet</strong>. There are <strong>340 knots per square inch</strong>.  That means there are <strong>over 28 million knots in The Ardabil Carpet. </strong>This means it was not only very plush but also highly intricate AND durable. It is interesting to note that a commercial rug today has only 80-160 knots per square inch.</p>

<h5><strong>Why was this Created?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> was <strong>made for prayer</strong> in the funerary shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili. The carpet is one of a matching pair and was made when the shrine was enlarged under the reign of Shah Tahmasp, He was a very famous and popular Sufi mystic.</p>
<p>This shrine was considered sacred to Safavid rulers and subjects and therefore it received many offerings. It remained at the shrine for three centuries until they were removed to England.</p>
<p>Prayer carpets like these decorated the floors of mosques, shrines, and homes – anywhere prayer occurred. Muslims must pray 5 times a day, oriented towards Mecca. Prayer carpets help to unify all members  as they pray together and create sense of community</p>
<p>Carpets like these were also considered works of art and Iranian carpets were prized for their intricate designs. Carpets were sold by craftspeople across Islamic lands and into China and Europe.  The Ardabil Carpet however attests to the great skills achieved in carpet by the people of north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Made the Ardabil Carpet?</strong></h5>
<p>It was made by a royal weaving factory, overseen by Maqsud Kashan. It is estimated that <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> would have taken four years to make, if 10 people were working on weaving it. Men were the weavers, even though women often did the actual weaving, but  the size and importance “necessitated and required” men.</p>
<h5><strong>Changing the Rules</strong></h5>
<p>Carpet used for religious purpose are supposed to be aniconic. The Ardabil Carpet it is not! It does however have two prayer lamps designed on it. These are likely to mimic lamps found on the ceiling of this funerary shrine, which would have created visual unity between the rug and its surroundings</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> is full of typical Islamic designs. There are geometric patterns, florals, and vegetative designs. Such designs belong to a class known as <strong>Northwest Medallion Carpets</strong>, which is one of 30 classifications for Persian carpets.</p>
<p>Ten colors were used in the design, and all were naturally sourced from items such pomegranates, the yellow spice saffron and indigo for the deep blue background. The white or cream shades were left naturally undyed.</p>
<p><strong>Northwestern Medallion Carpets</strong> are generally dominated by a central medallion.  In the center of <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> there is a gold medallion with a light blue roundel in the center, with floating open lotus blossoms. From the medallion 16 ovals circulate. Each is a different color in either red, green, or cream.</p>
<p>To the left and right there are decorative lamps. Cartouches or rectangular shapes that were used for calligraphy line the borders.</p>

<h5><strong>The Inscription</strong></h5>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an inscription of <strong>poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<p><em>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?resize=728%2C355&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="728" height="355" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The <strong>fourth line</strong> provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>A Comparison of the Two Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>In Persia in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it was not uncommon for important carpets to be woven in pairs. The Los Angeles carpet, although smaller after having had outer borders removed, is identical the Albert and Victoria carpet. The central medallion for example measures each other precisely.</p>
<p>The only thing that differs is the wool quality and weaving techniques in knot count, texture, and pile length. The London carpet has between 340 knots per square inch, while the Los Angeles carpet has 380 to 420 knots per square inch. Through this research the conclusion was made the rugs were not woven simultaneously, but within the same year. Some art historians believe that the Los Angeles carpet was woven first, because of the finer weave.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet is </strong>one of the oldest Islamic carpets in the word. It is named after the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.  This town was the home was a Sufi saint named Safi al-Din Ardabili who died in 1334. Sufism is Islamic mysticism.</p>
<p>After the saint died, his followers continued to grow and expand. Then, in 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma’il, seized power and united Iran, making the official religion Shi’a Islam. This was <strong>Safavids dynasty </strong>which ruled until 1722. This was an exciting period of art in the creation of textiles (the art of the loom) and manuscripts ( the art of the book).</p>
<p>It is estimated that today 1500 carpets and carpet fragments exist from the Safavid period.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-778" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C557&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="557" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h3>
<h3>Theme: “Divinity, infinity, and unity”</h3>
<p><strong>Islamic art</strong> is inspired by and entirely comprised of Islamic religious messages and content (divine). Additionally, much Islamic artwork is created not only to last forever but uses calligraphic script which relays the word of God – which is infinite – to the umma (Muslims). Lastly, Muslims believed there was unity in ordered and geometric multiplicity. Therefore, works of Islamic art are comprised of multiple parts and many different patterns and forms that are visually unified to create an entire composition.</p>
<p>Islamic art is not specific to a time, place, region or medium. It also spans an incredible 1400 years! It is inspired by many sources including:<br />
<strong>Roman</strong><br />
<strong>Early Christian</strong><br />
<strong>Byzantine</strong><br />
<strong>Sassanian art of pre-Islamic Persia</strong><br />
<strong>Central Asia and China</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-779" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Map.jpg?resize=800%2C527&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="527" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Map.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Map.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Key Terms</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Qur’an</strong>: The central religious text of Islam (Also written as Quran or Koran)</p>
<p><strong>Idolatry:</strong> The worship of idols.</p>
<p><strong>Monotheistic:</strong> Believing in a single god, deity, spirit</p>
<h5><strong>The Faith</strong></h5>
<p>Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet of God. An adherent of Islam is called a Muslim.</p>
<p>There are two denominations: the Sunni, which make up 75 to 90 per cent and the Shia which make up 10 to 20 percent.</p>
<p><strong>There are five pillars of Islam, which are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Shahadah (belief or confession of faith)</li>
<li>Salat (worship in the form of prayer)</li>
<li>Sawm Ramadan (fasting during the month of Ramadan)</li>
<li>Zakat (alms or charitable giving)</li>
<li>Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime)</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Historical Context 622-1600</strong></h5>
<p>The Muslim religion is one of five major religions in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad receives revelations from Angel Gabriel and God</li>
<li>He dies in 632. Muslims divided over succession issues (Sunni and Shi’a)</li>
<li>Umayyads (661-750)</li>
<li>Expand into North Africa and Iberia</li>
<li>Abbasids (750-1258) <strong>The Golden Age: mathematics, astronomy, medicine, natural sciences</strong></li>
<li>Mongols: Muslim world now <strong>divided between East</strong> (South and Central Asia, Iran) <strong>and West</strong> (Arabia, North Africa, Iberia)</li>
<li>Ottomans Capture Constantinople in 1453 with rapid expansion of religion and empire: <strong>theocracy</strong></li>
<li>Egalitarian religion that immediately dominates region and overcomes rivals</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Early Islamic Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Umayyad caliphate Period (661–750) </strong></h5>
<p>This is the formative period in Islamic art. The <strong>religious monuments</strong> erected under their patronage demonstrate an amalgam of Greco-Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian elements (decorative themes and motifs) while having an Islamic function and meaning.</p>
<p>The development of Islamic architecture were the requirements of the new religion. Customs necessitated a different usage of space. A royal ideology involved creating monuments which reflected their power and authority. The monuments were often constructed on sites of historical or symbolic significance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-792" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> in Jerusalem (691), the first major Umayyad architectural undertaking was built on a prominent site formerly occupied by Solomon’s Temple</li>
<li>the <strong>Great Mosques of Damascus</strong> (706) was the site of the former Roman temple and a fourth-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art in the Medieval Period (c. 900-1517 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>The Art of the Abbasid Period (750–1258)</strong></h5>
<p>They conquered the Umayyads (661–750) in 750, shifting the focal point of Islamic political and cultural life eastward from Syria to Iraq. <strong>Baghdad</strong> became the new Abbasid capital.</p>
<p>Today, virtually nothing remains from Abbasid Baghdad, so the nearby Samarra is used to understand the Abbasid art and architecture innovations.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way of carving surfaces, the so-called <strong>beveled style</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>arabesque</strong>: a repetition of abstract geometric or pseudo-vegetal forms which was widely used as wall decoration and popular in other media -wood, metalwork, pottery</li>
<li>an extensive use of <strong>color</strong> in decoration</li>
<li>possibly, the introduction of the <strong>technique of luster painting</strong> over a white glaze producing a glittering effect reminiscent of precious metal</li>
</ul>
<p>By the 10th century, the Muslim world was fragmented, and individual dynasties sprang up.</p>
<p>These dynasties had varying degrees of control over different parts of the lands where Islam was the dominant or a major religion. It was also the time of the European Christian crusades, which aimed to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims.</p>
<ul>
<li>In North Africa and the Near East, the <strong>Fatimids (909-1171)</strong>, emerged and ruled an area that includes present-day Egypt, Sicily, Algeria, Tunisia, and parts of Syria.</li>
<li>The major <strong>Turkic dynasties and people from Central Asia came</strong> to the forefront of Islamic politics and artistic creativity</li>
<li>The <strong>Seljuqs, Central Asian</strong> nomads eventually controlled Iran, Iraq and much of Anatolia</li>
<li>The <strong>Mamluks</strong>, the slave soldiers (mamluk, literally meaning “owned,”) controlled Syria and Egypt until 1517.</li>
<li>The invading <strong>Mongols</strong> and their great leader, <strong>Genghis Khan (c. 1162-1227)</strong>, Pax Mongolica</li>
<li>Blood-thirsty conquest and destruction of the Islamic world; established their rule over most Asia.</li>
<li>The <strong>West Asia</strong> (Iraq, Iran, Khorasan, Caucasus, and parts of Asia Minor) formed the “Il-Khanat,”lesser Khanat”</li>
<li>His legacy included the Pax Mongolica, the reconnection of the East and West (1279-1368), via the re-opened Silk Roads</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Seljuq Turks</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Nomadic Turkish warriors from Central Asia, established in the Middle East in 11th century</li>
<li>1055 founded the great Seljuk Sultanate (Turko-Persian Sunni) over Iran, Iraq, Syria</li>
<li>The dynasty brought revival, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians and acted as a buffer between Sunni, Shi’a, Christians, Mongols</li>
<li>Prevented the Fatimids of Egypt from spreading Shiite Islam</li>
<li>Created a barrier to Europe against the Mongol invaders</li>
<li>1071 at Manzikert they defeated the Byzantines conquering Anatolia; blocked inland expansion by the crusader states on the Syrian Coast in 12th century</li>
<li>Seljuk Turks are regarded as the ancestors of the inhabitants of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan.</li>
<li>Founded universities, patrons of art, literature; Persian astronomers, poets Omar Khayyám.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Ilkhanid Period (1256–1353)</strong></h5>
<p>In a short period of time, the Mongol control of most of Asia led to the so-called the Pax Mongolica, which reopened the <strong>Silk Road</strong> and created an environment of tremendous cultural exchange. <strong>East Asian elements are absorbed into the existing Perso-Islamic traditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decorative arts:</strong> textiles, metalwork, ivory-carving, ceramics furnished mosques, palaces</li>
<li>Major focus on <strong>illuminated and illustrated manuscripts</strong> (religious and secular)</li>
<li>An initial dynamic, almost dramatic phase followed by a more refined style</li>
<li>Great artistic development in manuscripts, such as those that recounted the Shahnama (or Book of Kings), the famous Persian epic</li>
<li><strong>Metalworkers </strong>created ewers, basins, cases in bronze/brass engraved, inlaid with silver</li>
<li>Also, great builders: mosques and Sufi shrines across Iran: Isfahan, Tabriz, and Yazd</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ilkhanid dynasty disintegrated in 1335 and local dynasties came to power in Iraq, Iran.</p>
<h5><strong>The Timurids (c. 1370-1507)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Timur (also known as Tamerlane)</strong>, who conquered and controlled all Central Asia, greater Iran, and Iraq, as well as parts of southern Russia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>The Timurids were outstanding builders of monumental architecture. Herat, in present-day Afghanistan, became the capital and cultural center of the Timurid empire.</p>
<h5><strong>The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1469) </strong></h5>
<p><strong>The medieval era of European al-Andalus</strong></p>
<p>When the Umayyad caliphate of Damascus was overthrown by the Abbasids in 750, the <strong>last surviving member of the Umayyad dynasty fled to Spain initiating the Umayyad emirate (756–929).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abd al-Rahman I (r. 756–88)</strong> made <strong>Córdoba </strong>his capital and unified al-Andalus under his rule with a firm hand, while establishing diplomatic ties with the northern Christian kingdoms, North Africa, and the Byzantine empire and maintaining cultural contact with the ‘Abbasids in Baghdad. Despite their open rejection of Abbasid political authority, the Umayyads of Córdoba emulated the opulent palatial arts of the centers of Abbasid power, Baghdad, and Samarra.</p>
<p><strong>The Almoravids (1062–1150), The Almohads (1150–1269), The Nasrids (1232-1492)</strong> of the southern Iberian Peninsula and western North Africa.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insistent pressure from Christian armies from the north, which successfully conquered Valencia, Játiva, and Jaén and made the Nasrids tribute-paying vassals in 1243.</li>
<li>Ends in 15th century after severe political crises in the Maghrib and the union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon through the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella.</li>
<li>Despite its precarious political situation, for over two and a half centuries Granada were the patrons of Islamic art in the Muslim West, attracting leading scholars and literati.</li>
<li><strong>Córdoba:</strong> the greatest intellectual center of Europe, with celebrated libraries and schools.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art Later Period (c. 1517 –1924 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>This period is the era of the last great Islamic Empires.</p>
<h5><strong>The Ottoman Empire 1281-WW1</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Started in 14th century as a small Turkic state in Anatolia</li>
<li>Emerged in the second half of the fifteenth century as a major military and political force.</li>
<li>the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453 and the Mamluk Empire in 1517.</li>
<li>Dominated much of Anatolia, the Balkans, the Near East, and North Africa until after WWI</li>
<li>Best known for mosques in the late 15<sup>th</sup> and early 16<sup>th</sup> century</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Safavids 1501–1722</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the greatest dynasty of Iran</li>
<li>Established Shia Islam as the dominant faith of Iran</li>
<li>Arts: architecture, painting, manuscripts, and carpets all flourished under the Safavids.</li>
<li>the Safavids most outstanding ruler, Shah Abbas (r. 1587–1629)- greatest patron of the arts</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Mughals. 1526–1858</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Founded by Babur</li>
<li>Ruled over the largest Islamic state in the Indian subcontinent.</li>
<li>conquered the earlier sultanates of today northern Indian and Pakistan</li>
<li>Patrons of some of the greatest works of Islamic art: illuminated manuscripts and painting, and architecture, including the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>patrons</strong> of this time were the rulers and elite. These works were both refined and decorative, reflecting order. No religious figures were shown at this time.</p>
<p>Painting and sculpture used <strong>arabesque</strong> or “Arab-like” flowing, intricate, repetitive pattern derived from stylized organic motifs, usually floral. <strong>Examples include acanthus leaves, vines, and spirals.</strong> It is a French word that was derived from the Italian word Arabesco, which simply means Arabic style.</p>
<p><strong>Tessellations </strong>is the repetition of geometric designs.</p>
<p><strong>Calligraphy</strong> was considered the highest art form. It transmits the word of God to Muhammad. These were the most respected artists. Yet, most artists remained anonymous. It wasn’t until only later calligraphers would sign their works.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Islamic architecture has a wide scope from both secular to religious styles.</p>
<p><strong>Mosque: </strong>A place of worship for Muslims, like a Christian church or Jewish synagogue. A mosque will often have at least one <strong>minaret</strong>. In Arabic the word mosque is <strong>masjid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minaret: </strong>The tall slender tower of an Islamic mosque, from which the <strong>muezzin </strong>(the man who calls Muslims to pray) recites the adhan call to prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Mihrab: </strong>A semicircular niche in the wall of a mosque, that indicates the <strong>qibla</strong> (direction of Mecca), and into which the <strong>imam </strong>(man who leads prayer) prays.</p>
<p><strong>Hypostyle halls</strong> or unified open interiors were a popular type of mosque structure.</p>
<h5><strong>Early Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>Recognized immediately as Islamic architecture, the building of Mosques began after Muhammad’s time. It incorporated traditional Roman building traditions, along with the local traditions of incorporating Sassanid and Byzantine models.</p>
<p>Historically, mosques have been used as both <strong>meeting places and a space to pray</strong>. Early mosques are said to be based on Muhammad’s home in Medina, which is officially the first mosque.</p>
<p>One of the best preserved and earliest mosques is the <strong>Great Mosque of Kairouan</strong>, in Tunisia. Dating back to 670 CE, it contains architectural features that distinguish <strong>early mosque styles</strong>. This includes <strong>a minaret, large courtyard, surrounded by porticos and a hypostyle prayer hall.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Ottoman Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>During the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> century <strong>Ottoman mosques</strong> were found in the cities of Bursa and Edirne. These were developed from earlier Seljuk Turk architecture, but were also influenced by Byzantine, Persian, and Islamic Mamluk.</p>
<p>This architecture was perfected in the 16<sup>th</sup> century with massive domes, and vast interiors, all of which appeared weightless. There were square dome plans, slender cornet minarets and columns. Think: <strong>The Blue Mosque</strong>, in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
<h5><strong>The Safavid Dynasty</strong></h5>
<p>During this time architecture flourished with large mosques, palaces such as Ali Qapu, numerous well-planned gardens, and an immense bazaar. Ishan, which was the capital of both the Safavid and the previous Seljuk dynasties saw the most growth.  Think: <strong>The Imperial Mosque </strong>built in 1598.</p>

<h5><strong>Textiles</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Textile arts </strong>falls under the category of arts and crafts. It uses plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to craft objects.  Working with textiles predates Islamic times and have also been of great importance to Middle Eastern cultures.</p>
<p>With the growth of Islamic dynasties textile development was controlled regionally. The most important textiles created were <strong>carpets.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Carpet Production During the Ottoman Empire </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>1299 CE Turkish tribes in northwestern Anatolia founded the Ottoman state</li>
<li>1453 tribes conquer Constantinople and establish the Ottoman Empire</li>
<li>The empire grows and stretches to include parts of Asia, Europe, and Africa</li>
<li>1922 monarchy was abolished in Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>Carpets were considered a <strong>decorative item</strong> during the Ottoman Empire. Not only were carpets placed on floors, but walls and even doors.  In addition to providing beauty, carpets helped to supply additional warmth and insolation when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Silk and cotton</strong> were the most common blend of fibers within the weave of Ottoman carpets. These works were rich in symbolism and religious meaning.</p>
<p>The most notable area for silk carpets was the town of Hereke. Artisans were known to create works of the very finest weaves that found homes in royal palaces.</p>
<h5><strong>Persian Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Iranian Safavid Empire (1501–1786)</strong> were strong contributors to textile arts. Starting as a craft among nomads and peasants it quickly grew into an area of expertise and carpets from this area were in demand internationally.</p>
<p>Some examples to note include:</p>
<p><strong>Anhalt Northwest Persian Medallion </strong>(Metropolitan Museum of Art)</p>
<p>This 16<sup>th</sup> century carpet is made from cotton and wool</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Further in this lesson we will look add the <strong>Ardabil Carpets</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Indonesian Batiks</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Carpets were not the only form of textiles. <strong>Batiks from Indonesia</strong> were also prized. These are cloths that are printed with design. In the dying process, wax is placed on sections where the artist does not want the color to be absorbed.  The process takes multiple steps to process a variety of colors within one design.</p>
<p>The creation of batiks predates Islam. Yet batiks reached a peak when royal Muslim courts produced not only cloth but garments.</p>
<p>In Islamic fashion cloth was produced with abstract and intricate design and for the most part were <strong>aniconic</strong>. In rare cases human and animal depictions can be found.</p>
<p>The appearance of <strong>pre-Islamic mythology</strong> is common, however. These images include <strong>Garuda</strong>, the immortal bird-god, known for strength and ferocity and defeating oceans full of snakes. These <strong>serpents </strong>are also part of batiks, as are <strong>puppets</strong> shaped in human form.</p>
<p>Today batiks still maintain importance. These artistic works are hung, worn, and used for wrapping the Quran.</p>
<h5><strong>Ceramics</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ceramics </strong>are another notable artform within Islamic art. Wonderful examples are evident in both pottery and building tiles.  Early pottery was left unglazed.</p>
<p>The first examples are <strong>opaque glazes</strong> which date back to the <strong>8<sup>th</sup> century </strong>and emerged through the <strong>Hispano–Moresque style</strong> in Adaluz or Muslim Spain. This type of glaze was achieved through using an <strong>opaque white tin-glaze.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hispano–Moresque style </strong>also introduced the ceramic technique of <strong>painting in metallic lusters</strong>. This gave pottery pieces an iridescent glaze by using transparent or semi-transparent glaze that was activated by first heating and then cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Hispano-Moresque style</strong> continued to flourish under <strong>Christian</strong> rule when elements from both religions appeared together in ceramic works.</p>
<p>The 9<sup>th</sup> century brought with it works in <strong>stonepaste </strong>from Iraq as well as <strong>lusterware </strong>from Persia and Syria. The influence of <strong>Chinese ceramics</strong> on Islamic artists in apparent in shape, technique, and decoration.</p>

<p>The ceramic piece (above) is entitled <strong>Bowl with Repeating Persian Inscription Wishing for Good Fortune</strong> is stonepaste with luster-painted on opaque white glaze. It dates from 1419-1420 CE and is attributed to Afghanistan or Iraq. On view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 455.</p>
<p>Ottoman Iznik produced excellent ceramic works in the 16th century. Influenced by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics artisans created tiles and vessels with floral cascades, human and animal forms.</p>

<h5><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h5>
<p>Work in <strong>calligraphy</strong>, the art of writing in decorative form, took on great importance. <strong>Kufic</strong> is the earliest form of Arabic calligraphy and is distinct for its <strong>angular form</strong>.</p>
<p>Quranic verse is not the only purpose. Calligraphy is also used to <strong>inscribe poetry</strong>, and to illustrate both <strong>ownership</strong> and generous donations.</p>
<p>Calligraphy is incorporated into <strong>books, art, architecture, coins</strong>,<strong> tiles</strong>, and <strong>metal work</strong>, in secular and non-secular forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Islamic painting in medieval times was dominated by two forms, <strong>book painting</strong> and <strong>miniatures.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Book Painting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Persia, Syria, Iraq</strong>, and the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> sparked a growth in the use of <strong>Islamic book painting</strong> during late medieval times.  During the Ilkhanid dynasty in Persia, examples of beauteous, large<strong>, illuminated manuscripts </strong>emerged.</p>
<p>During the 13<sup>th</sup> century <strong>manuscript paintings</strong> were influenced by the Byzantines and Mongols. Mongols was the generic term for a group of people comprised of both Mongolic and Turkic tribes of the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p><strong>Maquamat</strong>, the plural form of <strong>Maqāma</strong>, is an early medieval text and type of literary genre. It illustrated the day-to-day life of the people of the time. It contained prose that rhymed, with snippets of spiritual poetry.</p>
<h5><strong>Miniatures</strong></h5>
<p>Small paintings on paper, also known as <strong>miniatures, </strong>were an artistic tradition in <strong>Persia</strong>. The Mughals of India and Ottomans of Turkey also produced these artworks from which Persian artists were highly influenced.</p>
<p><strong>Mughal</strong> artists were known for their realistic portraits, many of which are in profile, while <strong>Ottoman </strong>artists used a more stylized form. Subjects included idealized youths, animals, family, and picnic scenes, as well as works focusing on individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts</strong> were part of the court and therefore had to pertain to all the religious rules governing the elimination of human depiction. While miniatures for a more general audience enabled human form.</p>
<p>Looking at miniature paintings during this time one can see the <strong>Byzantine influence</strong> visually. This includes work in blue and gold, as well as angelic motifs. <strong>Chinese influence</strong> is also apparent in the use of flowers such as peonies, as well as well as mythological creatures including phoenixes and dragons.</p>
<p><strong>Muraqqa </strong>is an album in book form combining Islamic <strong>miniature paintings</strong> and calligraphy from many different artists. The word Muraqqa is a Persian word that translates into “that which has been patched together”. Books of this type were popular among collectors in the Islamic world.</p>
<h5><strong>Glassmaking </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic glassmaking</strong> was considered <strong>a luxury art</strong> for the wealthy. During the Middle Ages, Islamic glass had a reputation for being the best in Eurasia and was shipped to buyers in both Europe and China. Some of the finest examples of glass from this time were found in <strong>lamps for mosques</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_831" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-831" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-831" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=401%2C535&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="401" height="535" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-831" class="wp-caption-text">Mosque Lamp</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Mosque Lamp</strong> (above) from the 14<sup>th</sup> century is attributed to Egypt and Syria. It is made from a colorless glass with a yellow tinge that was blown with an applied blown foot. It is both enameled and gilded. On view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 454.</p>
<p>During the 8<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> centuries glass was decorated with incised patterns or in relief, by cutting away sections of glass. <strong>Luster painting</strong>, which dates to 9<sup>th</sup> century Egypt was also popular. This was achieved with the application of metallic pigment during the glass making process. Sometimes threads of glass were created in different colored threads and then pulled into the main surface to be heated together. There are also examples of glass that has been <strong>gilded, painted, and enameled</strong>.</p>
<p>By the 1500s glassmaking expertise moved on to Venice, where many orders for mosque lamps were completed.</p>
<h5><strong>Islamic Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p>The inlay technique, where pieces of softer metals (such as <strong>copper, gold, and silver</strong>) were inlaid into harder metals (<strong>bronze or brass</strong>) were used, represents a high point in Islamic metalwork of the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Initially in the 12th century it was laborious. Imagine hammering wire into tiny grooves that were previously cut into the object. These were chiseled to about 1-mm deep recesses along the pattern lines. Later in the 14th century there was a shortage of silver, hammering the inlaid designs directly onto the roughened surface. This was more economical, but the inlays peeled off easily.</p>
<p><strong>Motifs and Symbols</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fatimid era (909-1071</strong>) brass vessels are simple and functional</p>
<ul>
<li>Kufic inscriptions</li>
<li>Decorative motifs showing birds, animals, geometric patterns, and vine tendrils</li>
<li>No human figures</li>
<li>This was forbidden according to a Koranic edict, which regards the human form in art as rivaling God’s creations.</li>

<p><em> </em><strong>The Kaaba </strong>located in <strong>Mecca, Saudi Arabia</strong>, is the holiest shrine in Islam.</p>
<p>Made from <strong>granite masonry, </strong>it is covered with<strong> silk curtain </strong>and<strong> calligraphy in gold and silver-wrapped thread. </strong>The silk curtain also known as <strong>kiswa</strong>, is replaced annually during the hajj. The monument measures <strong>43 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kaaba</strong> is the Arabic word for <strong>cube or square building.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Renovations and Additions</strong></h5>
<p>The structure has been <strong>renovated multiple times</strong>, and so has the surrounding mosque. <strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been set on fire and survived floods.  The black stone has been broken and reassembled with silver. The last major modifications were carried out in the 1950s by the government of Saudi Arabia to accommodate the increasingly large number of pilgrims who come on the hajj. Today the mosque covers almost 40 acres.</p>
<p>The <strong>door</strong> made of <strong>solid gold</strong> was added in 1982.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, is a large open space with <strong>colonnades on four sides</strong> and <strong>seven minarets</strong>, the largest number of any mosque in the world. At the center of this large plaza sits <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as well as many other holy buildings and monuments.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This important structure orients all mosques in the world. EVERY mosque is faced towards <strong>The Kaaba</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Prayer </strong></h5>
<p>Muslims <strong>pray</strong> <strong>five times per day</strong>. This is one of the five pillars of the faith.  These prayers are directed toward <strong>Mecca</strong> and <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as they have been since 624 CE. All mosques are marked with a <strong>qibla</strong> to know in which direction they need to pray.</p>
<h5><strong>Pilgrimage</strong></h5>

<p>Pilgrimage to a holy site is a core principle of almost all faiths. All Muslims aspire to undertake the hajj, or the annual pilgrimage, to <strong>The Kaaba</strong> once in their lives. This is another fundamental principle of the faith.</p>
<p>Once in Mecca, pilgrims gather in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram around <strong>The Kaaba</strong>. They then walk around <strong>The Kaaba.</strong> The goal is to kiss and touch the <strong>Black Stone</strong>—al-Hajar al-Aswad—embedded in the eastern corner.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> is a square building with a small interior room. Placed on the corner is the <strong>Black Stone </strong>which is the only original piece that remains on the site.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>According to tradition, the first building was <strong>built by Old Testament figure Abraham (known as Ibrahim in Islamic) and his son. </strong>Abraham’s son with his servant Hagar was Ismail. It is believed to be a structure that Abraham and his son Ismail created. It was built close to where Hagar found water.</p>
<p>The original sanctuary was a simple roofed rectangular structure. It housed the <strong>Black Stone</strong> (given to Abraham by the angel Gabriel) and statues of pagan gods.</p>
<p>The site was a <strong>pre-Islamic</strong> pilgrimage run by the Qaresh tribe, to which Muhammad belonged.</p>
<p>It was rebuilt it in 608 CE with masonry and wood. A door was included above ground level to protect the interior from intruders and flood waters.</p>

<h5><strong>Timeline: </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>When <strong>Muhammad</strong> successfully and captured Mecca in <strong>630 CE</strong>, he claimed the building for Islam and appropriated it. He also cleansed <strong>The Kaaba</strong> of its pagan god statues</li>
<li><strong>634-644 CE:</strong> second caliph Umar expanded the area around <strong>The Kaaba</strong> to accommodate more pilgrims</li>
<li><strong>644-656:</strong> third caliph Uthman built colonnades around the plaza where <strong>The Kaaba</strong> stands</li>
<li><strong>683 CE:</strong> <strong>The Kaaba</strong> was set on fire during a civil war
<ul>
<li><strong>The Black Stone</strong> broke into three pieces and was reassembled with silver</li>
<li><strong>The Kaaba</strong> was rebuilt in wood and stone and the space around it was paved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>By end of 7<sup>th</sup> century</strong>, <strong>The Kaaba</strong> was covered with <strong>kiswa</strong> a black cloth that is replaced annually during hajj.</li>
<li><strong>705-715 CE</strong>: Umayyad caliph al-Walid decorated the mosque that encloses <strong>The Kaaba</strong> with mosaics</li>
<li><strong>16<sup>th</sup> century</strong>: Ottomans heavily renovated the site (Suleyman I and Selim II)</li>
<li><strong>1631</strong>: <strong>The Kaaba</strong> and mosque were entirely rebuilt after floods had demolished them</li>
</ul>
<p>***Today, only Muslims may visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> sits on the highest point of old <strong>Jerusalem, Palestine. </strong>It is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong> with a <strong>wooden roof</strong> decorated with <strong>glazed ceramic tile, mosaics</strong>, and <strong>gilt aluminum</strong> and <strong>bronze dome</strong>. The dome measures <strong>67 feet</strong> on each side, plus 67 feet for the width of dome, and the same measurement for the height of drum.</p>

<p>The domed wooden octagonal building is <strong>centrally planned </strong>with <strong>two</strong> <strong>ambulatories</strong> that encircle the stone in the middle. The <strong>first ambulatory</strong> has 16 columns in its arcade. The <strong>second ambulatory</strong> has 24 columns in its arcade. This area is decorated with mosaic inscriptions from the Quran.</p>
<p>Notice in the arcade that the voussoirs are alternating colors. This is typical for Islam.</p>

<h5><strong>Entering Paradise</strong></h5>
<p>In Islam, there are <strong>8 levels of Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>8 x 2 = 16</p>
<p>8 x 3 = 24</p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Influences</strong></h5>
<p>At the time Islam was a very new religion and determined its artist influences cross culturally.</p>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock was </strong>Influenced by <strong>Byzantine</strong> centrally planned buildings like San Vitale. They also borrowed the Byzantine tradition of <strong>mosaic work</strong>.  Mosaics on this building use <strong>tessellation</strong> or polygonal shapes that repeat without gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Roman influence</strong> can be seen in <strong>mausolea</strong>, (burial places for Roman emperors were circular) and the <strong>Roman dome</strong> (Pantheon). They were also Influenced by <strong>columns</strong> taken from Roman monuments (<strong>spolia</strong>) and the <strong>arcade</strong>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Coptic</strong> traditions of present-day Egypt and Syria, include its geometric motifs. <strong>Sassanian</strong> metal work was borrowed from what is present day Iran.</p>
<h5><strong>Pure Geometry</strong></h5>

<p>All decoration is <strong>aniconic</strong> meaning it is nonrepresentational and purely geometric . Here is why.</p>
<p>Muslims believed that <strong>mathematics</strong> was an indication that God controlled and had created the entire universe. <strong>Tessellations </strong>and mathematical designs help to reinforce this idea.</p>
<p>Muslims took the second commandment very strictly. It reads, “Thou shalt have no graven images”.  This was interpreted by Muslims as meaning there should not be anything representational in any religious art whatsoever</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Original function still debated – but it is a shrine, NOT a mosque</li>
<li>Symbol of caliphate strength</li>
<li>Testament to the power of the new Islamic faith</li>
<li>Pilgrimage site: Muslim pilgrims circumambulate the rock at the center of the building</li>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> is the earliest surviving Islamic building. It was created during the Umayyad period and the 1<sup>st</sup> caliphate of Islam.</p>
<p>It was built under the patronage of Abd al-Malik, who was the most important Umayyad caliph,  in the midst of a civil war</p>
<p>Whether there was a Byzantine church on this site, or near it, is still debated. Yet the Byzantine church style was still a huge influence on this building.</p>

<p>The <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba</strong>, stands in<strong> Córdoba, Spain. </strong>This magnificent architectural structure is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong>.</p>
<p>It was built here for the practical reason. The land was already available and flat. The site was recognized as an important structure. An entire town was built around it. The work was used to show religious and cultural supremacy over the Romans.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/56-Great-Mosque-Plan.gif?resize=490%2C700&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="490" height="700" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The floor plan is the one of three kinds for mosques: <strong>Hypostyle Hall</strong>, Four-Iwan, Central Plan.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-799" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?resize=990%2C604&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="604" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The main building is comprised of the <strong>hypostyle hall. </strong>Through the use of repeated geometry, the hall seems larger than it is.  There are 514 <strong>double-horseshoe-arch</strong> columns, with alternating red and white <strong>voussoirs. </strong>Columns are Roman <strong>spolia</strong> from the temple here. Horseshoe arches are common feature of Visogoth Spanish architecture, which was then adopted by Muslims in Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Qiblah wall</strong> and <strong>mihrab</strong> are designated on the back wall. <strong>Mihrabs</strong> typically face Mecca and the Kaba which is what Muslims must specifically direct their prayers towards. However, this mosque does not face Mecca. It seems to be a mistake on the original understanding of geography by the Muslims who built it. In addition, it was originally a church and Muslims were not able to change the foundation to reorient the mosque towards Mecca.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba </strong>is a place for worship, prayer and contemplation. Hypostyle hall mosque encourages the viewer to contemplate the space and to seek out the qiblah wall which contains the mihrab. Here they must direct prayer.  to the mihrab</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the</strong> <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba.</strong></h5>
<p>The courtyard contained a fountain, a covered walkway encircling the courtyard, a minaret, and an orange grove. Oranges were symbols of Cordobans.</p>
<p><strong>Qiblah wall</strong> is the wall that people must find. because it points towards the Kaaba in Mecca.  It also contains the <strong>mihrab.</strong> This is an empty arch on the qiblah wall. Mosque-goers pray towards this, not this. It is an empty arch because there can be no images of religious figures represented in Muslim religion.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>This is an example of<strong> Moorish</strong> culture. Muslims once ruled over Spain, or <strong>Al-Andalus</strong> as it was called in Arabic. <strong>Cordoban Caliphate </strong>began with exiles from the previous caliphate ,Umayyads. Established by Abd al-Rahman I, who ran away to Spain and established control over Iberia, he sponsored elaborate building programs. This became the center of a brilliant Golden Age for Isla.</p>
<p><strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba </strong>is one of the oldest structures still standing from when the Muslims ruled Al-Andalus.</p>
<p>There was originally a temple on the site to Janus, the Roman god of time, both past and future. It was converted into a church by Visogoths, in 572 CE.  Then, it was made into a mosque. Following this, it was totally rebuilt by the Cordoban Caliphate. Later, it was made into a Gothic church, with buttresses and pointed vaults added. A Renaissance style nave was eventually constructed.</p>
<p>Today, it is still a Catholic church.  Beginning in early 2000s, Muslims petitioned the Church to allow them to worship here and have since been consistently denied.</p>

<p>This is the second of <strong>three mosque styles</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hypostyle Hall</li>
<li><strong>Four-iwan</strong></li>
<li>central plan</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Four-iwan Mosque Style</strong></h5>
<p>This style of mosque, of which <strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>is a prime example, has a large courtyard with four open vaulted rooms or <strong>iwans</strong> open to the courtyard.  This courtyard contains water. On holy days, Muslims <strong>must wash their hands and feet before entering a mosque.</strong></p>
<p>The four <strong>iwans</strong> are framed by <strong>pishtaqs</strong>. These are rectangular frames around pointed arched openings. Iwans help to bring light and ventilation into what would otherwise be dark rooms.</p>
<h5><strong>The Color Blue</strong></h5>
<p>Use of <strong>blue colored tile</strong> in mosaic tessellations is very distinctive for <strong>Safavid</strong> architecture. It uses  aniconic imagery since this is a mosque. Notice the curving, decorative lines, or <strong>arabesques. </strong>These are used as a veneer over a brick core.</p>

<h5><strong>The Ogival Arch</strong></h5>
<p>The architecture uses the <strong>pointed arch</strong>, an influence that comes from the Christian West. This arch is  often called an <strong>ogival arch</strong> since it pinches slightly at the top.</p>
<h5><strong>Qiblah Iwan</strong></h5>
<p>This is the location of the <strong>mihrab</strong>. It is the only one marked with two <strong>minarets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Muezzin</strong> will call people to prayer from the minarets</li>
<li>Reserved for use by rulers</li>
<li>Constructed in 1310 by Mongols (Ilkhanid) rulers</li>
<li>Can see the <strong>minbars</strong> (short flight of steps used as a platform by a preacher in a mosque)</li>
<li>Iwan is filled with <strong>muqarnas </strong>(3D triangle that curls out towards you; layered over one another to make the interior of an arch grow out <strong>towards you)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh)</strong> is a mosque for personal prayer, worship, and contemplation. It is also the center of community and a  way of bringing people together and facilitating community. The courtyard creates a tranquil space with water where the viewer can sit and relax.</p>
<p>The mosque was connected to several pedestrian walkways originally. This facilitated not only public mobility but also commercial activity in connection to the mosque, as it was located near a large market.</p>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Isfahan was the capital of the Seljuk Turk empire</li>
<li>The mosque was expanded upon for a period of 1,000 years (8<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries)</li>
<li>In 700 CE, it was just a small mosque with the courtyard</li>
<li>11<sup>th</sup> century: core structure of the 4-iwan model was added by Seljuk Turks (under the reign of Malik Shah I, ruled 1072-1092)</li>
<li>Later rulers constantly expanded it (Mongol period – Ilkhanid; Timurid; Safavid</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>The Exterior</strong></h5>
<p>The exterior has elegantly stacked domes with towering minarets or <strong>pencil minarets</strong>. <strong>Muezzin</strong>, or person who will lead the prayer would call everyone to prayer from the minarets.</p>
<p>Here, a complex system of buttresses were used to hold up the massive weight of the dome. It is over 101 feet across, which is larger Hagia Sophia’s dome.</p>
<p>The building consists of 384 windows.</p>
<h5><strong>The Interior</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-498" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-498" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim-B.jpg?resize=500%2C733&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="733" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim-B.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim-B.jpg?resize=205%2C300&amp;ssl=1 205w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-498" class="wp-caption-text">Mosque of Selim II<br />© Vanni Archive/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The dome rests upon <strong>eight</strong> <strong>piers</strong>. The architect used <strong>squinches</strong> to transfer a circle into an octagon. There is <strong>Aniconic </strong>decoration with mosaic <strong>tessellation, </strong>or repetition of geometric design. The alternating red and white <strong>voussoirs </strong>are typical for Islamic architecture.</p>
<p>The <strong>mihrab</strong> is visible from almost any spot in the building even though it is not under the middle dome. It is pushed back into an apse-like alcove. Again, centrally planned spaces are symbolic and work nicely to unite people but are not actually designed to accommodate prayers or organized activities.</p>
<p>The <strong>muzzin</strong>, or prayer leader, had has platform under the center of the dome .</p>
<p>In this floor plan at  the front of the mosque sits a rectangular court, with an area equal to that of the mosque.</p>
<h5><strong>The Function</strong></h5>
<p>The mosque  is a place for prayer, contemplation, and community. Politically, mosques were a way for the Ottomans to show they had beat the Byzantine Empire.  It also symbolized Islam over Christianity.</p>
<p>The mosque’s design was based on Hagia Sophia. It was a statement of triumph to both the patron,  and the architect.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Patron and Location</strong></h5>
<p>Ottoman Sultan<strong> Selim II</strong>, the new Ottoman ruler, was the son of Son of Suleyman the Magnificent, who brought the Ottomans to the greatest territorial height. This mosque was built at the peak of Ottoman power in the Middle East.</p>
<p>When the rulers commissioned the work, he chose this spot specifically for the mosque. It was on the highest and would dominate the skyline.</p>
<p>Edirne, where the mosque is located, was the capital city of the Ottomans. It was the westernmost Ottoman city. For Europeans who may have encountered the city, it strategically made a good first impression.</p>
<p>This was the center of the community. The mosque had a school, or <strong>madrasas</strong> for studying Prophet Muhammad and his sayings. There was also a market, soup kitchen, bath, hospital, hospice, and cemetery.  The mosque was the meeting point to draw everyone together.</p>

<p><strong>Alhambra Palace</strong>, in <strong>Granada, Spain</strong>, is a <strong>whitewashed adobe</strong> made from <strong>stucco, wood, tile, paint and gilding</strong>. It is comprised of 1 mile of walls, 32 towers. It rests upon Sabika Hill, over 26 acres of land. This was a strategic vantage point for defense.</p>
<p>The exterior is plain and austere. There are many open passageways and courtyards, so sun and air could be freely admitted.</p>
<h5><strong>The Alcazaba and Royal Palace</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Alhambra Palace</strong> was originally an <strong>alcazaba </strong>or Islamic fortress for military purposes, with a citadel and barracks for elite guard. It was also a Royal Arab residence. This beautiful work of architecture was also propaganda to show off the power of the Nasrid kings.</p>
<p>It was a place to bring guests or ambassadors to show them the luxury and lavish life of the Nasrids. The elite enjoyed elaborate courtyards and gardens, which often included water. This created a sense of harmony and tranquility. Water is a major decorative element in Islam that promotes reflection, cooling, and peaceful qualities.</p>
<p>After the conquests of the Muslims in Spain, it was converted into a Christian Palace. Then, it was  converted into a Christian palace after the conquest of Muslims in Spain.</p>

<h5><strong>A Walk Through </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Alcazaba</strong> is the is the oldest part of the Alhambra. It was built by Mohammed I, who used it as his place of residence. Historians believe it was built over a Roman fortress. The rulers lived here until the rest of the palace was complete.</p>
<p>The Palace was organized around two central courtyards and included watch towers. It was highly decorated and made to feel like a “Paradise on Earth.”</p>

<p><strong>The Court of the Lions</strong>  is an oblong court that was surrounded by 124 slender columns. Each column connects to an arch that uses <strong>muqarnas. </strong>The columns and muqarnas arches were supposed to be reminiscent of palm trees that let light in but create patterns of shadow on the ground.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>lion fountain in the center</strong>, built and engineered by Muhammad V. It is supported by twelve lionesses. Each hour on the hours a lioness would produce water out of her mouth, as a representation of a clock keeping time.</p>
<p>The fountain utilized a complex hydraulics system, using two water channels that formed a cross in the center of the courtyard. The fountain apparently baffled all who saw it, even inspiring a poem on the fountain by Ibn Zamrak.</p>
<p>Although, not designed with anatomical accuracy, it was intended to show strength and power. Historians speculate that the four to the two water channels is associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The water flowing through suggests giving life. Although the twelve lions represent the 12 hours on a clock, they could also represent the 12 signs of the zodiac.</p>
<h5>SUB-IMAGE 2 (<strong>Hall of Two Sisters</strong>)</h5>

<p>This hall was in the center of a series of rooms where the sultana and her family lived. It had a highly sophisticated and refined interior.</p>
<p>The ceiling was made from 5000 muqarnas pieces reflecting light to create a delicate and open interior. It contained eight studded star shapes to represent the eight levels of paradise. There were 16 windows spread across two levels.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hall of Two Sisters</strong> was not named for siblings, rather it was named for two large twin marble flagstones that make up the floor.</p>

<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in <strong>Agra, Uttar Pradesh, in Northern India</strong>, is an ancient <strong>Indian mausoleum</strong> representing exquisite <strong>Indo-Islamic architecture</strong> that measures <strong>240 feet</strong> across and sits on <strong>42 acres</strong>. The building is made with <strong>stone masonry</strong> and <strong>marble</strong>, along with <strong>an inlay of precious and semiprecious stones</strong>.</p>
<p>Masons, marble workers, mosaicists, and decorators worked under the supervision of <strong>Ustad Ahmad Lahori</strong>, architect of the emperor.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is not a singular marvel, rather it is a large complex, with the <strong>main tomb</strong> flanked by <strong>twin mosques</strong> that are identical in size. The complex also consists of a <strong>guest house</strong></p>
<p>There are also the grounds filled with impressive <strong>gardens</strong> called Chahar bagh, which used the Persian style.</p>
<p>A thoughtful blend of Persian, Turkic, and Indian styles, it is one of the finest instances of <strong>Mughal art and architecture.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>More About the Mungal Kingdom</strong></h5>
<p>The Mughal kingdom had expanded its Islamic rule over vast areas of northern and central India. Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces.</p>
<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the Taj Mahal is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Taj Mahal epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, <strong>bringing many Persian artists to India</strong>.</p>
<p>The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many <strong>Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists</strong> were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of <strong>miniature paintings</strong>. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing, and being influenced by indigenous Indian art.</p>
<p>Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.</p>
<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s</strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of Islamic and Indian architecture.  Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the Taj Mahal as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule.</p>
<p>Many <strong>motifs from Hindu culture</strong> had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style</strong>, some plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian.</p>
<h5><strong>Artists and Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Mughals were known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, it allowed for easy access to water. Moreover, Agra was known as a “riverfront” city</p>
<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent.</p>
<p>The <strong>five principal elements</strong> of the complex, which includes the <strong>main gateway</strong>, <strong>garden</strong>, <strong>mosque</strong>, <strong>jawāb </strong>(literally “answer”, a building mirroring the mosque), and <strong>mausoleum</strong> (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.</p>
<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose and Symbolic Meaning of Taj Mahal</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
<h5>Projecting unique beauty, the <strong>mausoleum</strong> is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King, and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb.</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Taj Mahal is the <strong>symbol of unconditioned love</strong>. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the Taj Mahal has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaj by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.</p>
<p>As it is built on the <strong>raised platform</strong>, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural <strong>metaphor for Paradise</strong>. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.</p>
<p>Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is a <strong>symbol of compassion and royalty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> emphasizes the <strong>power </strong>vested in royal Mughal patrons.</p>
<h5><strong>Significance of Geography </strong></h5>
<p>Shah Jahan decided to build <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.</p>
<h5><strong>Entering the Complex</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-811" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=975%2C556&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="556" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone</strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna river, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal is built on a square and <strong>raised platform or a plinth</strong>. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of <strong>eight paradises</strong>, rendering the plan <strong>octagonally</strong>. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-814" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=990%2C474&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="474" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?w=455&amp;ssl=1 455w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>central chamber</strong> with an onion-shaped dome is <strong>flanked by four minarets</strong> at the four corners of the plinth. Mounted with a finial and a crescent moon, the dome is a golden spot of wonder. At the lower lever, <strong>four smaller-sized domes</strong> surrounding the central dome. Each small dome comprises a <em><strong>chhatri</strong></em><em> </em>(kiosk), enclosing a balcony.</p>
<p>The <strong>arched gate</strong> to enter the tomb is called <em><strong>iwan</strong></em><strong><em>.</em></strong> It is framed by a rectangular and decorated surface called <em><strong>Pishtaq</strong></em><strong>.</strong> The gates and other walls project <strong>chamfered corners</strong>, a peculiar style of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the four minarets are tilted away from the central dome, as a precautionary act to avoid damage to the main structure, especially during an occurrence of a natural calamity. Minarets also have a <em><strong>chhatri </strong></em>and a staircase to reach the top. They are associated with the religious duty of calling for daily prayers. The <em><strong>muezzin</strong></em>, the official assigned the announcing duty, calls the public for the <em><strong>namaz</strong></em><em> </em>or prayer from these minarets.</p>

<h5><strong>The Bodies at Rest</strong></h5>
<p>The central chamber places the two cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaj. Shah Jahan died thirty years after his wife. Mumtaj died after giving birth to their 14th offspring in 1631.</p>
<p>The real <strong>sarcophagi</strong> are safely stored at the lower level. The sarcophagi are ornate with <strong>calligraphy</strong>. The surface calligraphic verses from Quran are <strong>inlaid in precious stones</strong>. The technique is known as Pietra dura, which uses cut and polished colored stones. The verses refer to the paradise and day of judgment, wherein God royally and dutifully rewards the faithful.</p>
<p>The tomb shows <strong>floral patterns</strong> as animal or human figures are prohibited, as per Islam protocols. In addition, the <em><strong>jali</strong></em><em> </em>or mesh decorative work and <strong>lapidary</strong> relating to the engraving, cutting, or polishing of stones and gems is frequently observed.</p>

<h5><strong>A Place of Wonder </strong></h5>
<p>Considered as <strong>one of the seven man-made wonders of the world</strong>, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is known as the <strong>Crown of the Palace</strong>. Originally, it was known as Rauza-i-munawwara, which means illuminated tomb. It is situated in Agra, a northern city of India.</p>
<p>In 1983, UNESCO designated the Taj Mahal and the complex as <strong>World Heritage site</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Yesterday and Today</strong></h5>
<p>During the time the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> was built, the Indian continent observed an entry of Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, incrementing the business with Indian counterparts. The presence of Europeans also appears in many Mughal paintings, proving their acceptance in Mughal courts.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan was a promoter of arts and culture, which did not pass onto the next Mughal ruler and his son Aurangzeb. Hence, Aurangzeb&#8217;s disinterest and disengagement led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving the ground for Britishers to take charge by the 18th century.</p>
<p>Taj Mahal oversees millions of worldwide tourists every year. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns, resulting in many newer rules and regulations for the visitors. Nevertheless, the penchant of Shah Jahan for erecting a wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection is path breaking. Continuing to draw visitors to Agra to glimpse this architectural beauty, even after four hundred years, Taj Mahal continues to inspire awe.</p>

<p><strong>Folio from a Qur’an </strong>was created with <strong>ink, color,</strong> and <strong>gold</strong> on <strong>parchment paper. </strong>The paper was costly and made from sheep or goat skin.  The work measures <strong>12 inches wide. </strong></p>
<p>The word <strong>folio</strong> simply means a <strong>page in a book</strong>. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p>The page uses <strong>calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used by early scribes is known as <strong>Kufic. </strong>This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>illuminated manuscript</strong> or a medieval Biblical book (5th – 14th centuries). Illuminated can <strong>refer to vibrancy of color</strong> or illuminated can refer to <strong>the viewer’s enlightenment while reading the text</strong>.</p>
<p>On each page there is <strong>Greek text on top and corresponding image below. </strong>Only 48 out of 192 pages survive. Originally the <strong>pages were purple</strong> which was an expensive dye. Potentially a royal patron? The <strong>lettering was silver</strong> and has now tarnished.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Louvre</p>
<p><strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>is an example of<strong> decorative arts </strong>that is both beautiful and utilitarian. Made of  solid <strong>ivory</strong> from the tusk of an elephant, the work stands <strong>6 inches tall</strong>.  Ivory was expensive, durable, smooth, elegant, and easily carved, making it a highly desirable material. This pyxis was made from the famous workshop of Madinat al-Zahra</p>
<p>Islamic art is not always <strong>aniconic</strong>, meaning it does not use animal or human form. It is religiously <strong>aniconic</strong> only. In non-religious or secular and for private use, representational images can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong>: literally means “<em>fear of emptiness</em>” and refers to artwork that is completely full of imagery. This decorative work is an example of this. The work is dense, overcrowded, and intricate, with no space for recession.</p>

<h5><strong>Politically Utilitarian</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>was a gift to 18-year-old al-Mughira, son of a caliph, as a coming of age present. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is cylindrical box with a separate lid. The one has a <strong>utilitarian</strong> purpose, as it was used for cosmetics. Royal men wore makeup, particularly eye makeup, as a sign of status.</p>
<p>Ivory objects were given to royalty on important occasions. Think marriage, birth, and coming of age.</p>
<p>Such works expresses the political authority of the Spanish Umayyads.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This work is decorated with four eight-lobed medallions. This is symbolism of the number eight. It represents the eight levels of Paradise. There are carved falconers, griffons, peacocks, birds, and animals to be hunted.</p>
<p><strong>Royal iconography</strong> includes courtly figures and lute players. Falcons were a symbol of Umayyad legitimacy and power. Date palm trees may allude to the lost Umayyad lands of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The two lions symbolize the Umayyads.</p>
<p>The inscription reads: “God’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him.”</p>

<p><strong>Basin <em>(Baptistère de St. Louis</em>) </strong><strong>Muhammad ibn al-Zain </strong>measures <strong>20 inches wide</strong> and is made with <strong>brass </strong>and <strong>inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p>Brass is a mix of copper and zinc. For a work to be inlaid with silver and gold, it requires delicate hammering. Artists used the combination of metals to provide contrast and emphasis and to allow the viewer to see the figures easier. The entire work in decorated, even inside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-835" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=700%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="405" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?w=567&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Since this work is a secular piece there is a relaxation of <strong>aniconism </strong>and it instead contains representational imagery.  Figures are <strong>stylized</strong>, dense, overlapping, with no clear sense of space parallel to picture plane.</p>
<p>Note: Figures do not have halos, rather this has been done to help highlight the figures’ faces and distinguish them from the surrounding inlaid silver work.</p>
<h5><strong>Original Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended for a wealthy Muslim courtly secular audience. It was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk as a banqueting vessel or basin for handwashing.</p>
<h5><strong>Eventual Function</strong></h5>
<p>Somehow this work ended up in France. It was used during the 17<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> centuries to baptize French royal children (<strong>appropriation</strong>) although the association with St. Louis is probably fictional.</p>
<p>WHY would the French royalty be okay using an Islamic object to BAPTIZE French ROYAL children? The answer is unknown, as is the answer to how the Basin ends up in French royal hands</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>

<p>Since this was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk, it probably depicts specific individuals and Mamluk battles. <strong>Iconography </strong>is very dense and complex. It has not been interpreted much by historians and the meanings are probably lost</p>
<p>The <strong>exterior</strong> has four figures in roundels, each on horseback. Two are hunting. One is drawing a bow and arrow. One is holding a club. These may be personifications of the different aspects of Mamluk horsemanship. There are Mamluk officials, macebearers, ax-bearers, and bow-bearers.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom bands</strong> are registers of animals that decorate the basin.</p>
<p>The common symbol is the <strong>fleur de lys</strong>. Ultimately this became the symbol of the French family, which may explain the use by the French, but this was also the symbol of the Mamluk sultans.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mamluks</strong> were warrior slaves in Egypt who took control of several Muslim regions. They established a <strong>dynasty from Egypt to Syria from 1250-1517</strong> when Ottomans conquered them.</p>
<p>Political and military dominance led to wealth which led to a flourishing artistic culture known for brass.</p>

<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet,</strong> from <strong>Iran</strong>, is made from <strong>silk </strong>warps and wefts with <strong>wool </strong>pile. The wool was added because it naturally absorbs dyes, which are all natural come from items such as pomegranates and indigo. Rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, natural arabesques make for a stunning carpet.</p>
<p>The carpet measures <strong>34 by 17 feet</strong>. There are <strong>340 knots per square inch</strong>.  That means there are <strong>over 28 million knots in The Ardabil Carpet. </strong>This means it was not only very plush but also highly intricate AND durable. It is interesting to note that a commercial rug today has only 80-160 knots per square inch.</p>

<li>Portable, though its size was massive</li>

<ul>
<li>That means it had over 28 million knots</li>

</ol>
<h5><strong>Why was this Created?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> was <strong>made for prayer</strong> in the funerary shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili. The carpet is one of a matching pair and was made when the shrine was enlarged under the reign of Shah Tahmasp He was a very famous and popular Sufi mystic.</p>
<p>This shrine was considered sacred to Safavid rulers and subjects and therefore it received many offerings. It remained at the shrine for three centuries until they were removed to England.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer carpets</strong> like these decorated the floors of mosques, shrines, and homes – anywhere prayer occurred. Muslims must pray 5 times a day, oriented towards Mecca. Prayer carpets help to unify all members  as they pray together and create sense of community</p>
<p>Carpets like these were also considered works of art and Iranian carpets were prized for their intricate designs. Carpets were sold by craftspeople across Islamic lands and into China and Europe.  The Ardabil Carpet however attests to the great skills achieved in carpet by the people of north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Made the Ardabil Carpet?</strong></h5>
<p>It was made by a royal weaving factory, overseen by Maqsud Kashan. It is estimated that <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> would have taken four years to make, if 10 people were working on weaving it. Men were the weavers, even though women often did the actual weaving, but  the size and importance “necessitated and required” men.</p>
<h5><strong>Changing the Rules</strong></h5>
<p>Carpet used for religious purpose are supposed to be aniconic. The Ardabil Carpet it is not! It does however have two prayer lamps designed on it. These are likely to mimic lamps found on the ceiling of this funerary shrine, which would have created visual unity between the rug and its surroundings</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> is full of typical Islamic designs. There are geometric patterns, florals, and vegetative designs. Such designs belong to a class known as <strong>Northwest Medallion Carpets</strong>, which is one of 30 classifications for Persian carpets.</p>
<p>Ten colors were used in the design, and all were naturally sourced from items such pomegranates, the yellow spice saffron and indigo for the deep blue background. The white or cream shades were left naturally undyed.</p>

<p><strong>Northwestern Medallion Carpets</strong> are generally dominated by a central medallion.  In the center of <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> there is a gold medallion with a light blue roundel in the center, with floating open lotus blossoms. From the medallion 16 ovals circulate. Each is a different color in either red, green, or cream.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-838" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191.-B.png?resize=420%2C326&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="420" height="326" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191.-B.png?w=420&amp;ssl=1 420w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191.-B.png?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To the left and right there are decorative lamps. Cartouches or rectangular shapes that were used for calligraphy line the borders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?resize=728%2C355&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="728" height="355" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Inscription</strong></h5>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an inscription of <strong>poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<p><em>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</em></p>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The <strong>fourth line</strong> provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>A Comparison of the Two Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>In Persia in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it was not uncommon for important carpets to be woven in pairs. The Los Angeles carpet, although smaller after having had outer borders removed, is identical the Albert and Victoria carpet. The central medallion for example measures each other precisely.</p>
<p>The only thing that differs is the wool quality and weaving techniques in knot count, texture, and pile length. The London carpet has between 340 knots per square inch, while the Los Angeles carpet has 380 to 420 knots per square inch. Through this research the conclusion was made the rugs were not woven simultaneously, but within the same year. Some art historians believe that the Los Angeles carpet was woven first, because of the finer weave.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet is </strong>one of the oldest Islamic carpets in the word. It is named after the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.  This town was the home was a Sufi saint named Safi al-Din Ardabili who died in 1334. Sufism is Islamic mysticism.</p>
<p>After the saint died, his followers continued to grow and expand. Then, in 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma’il, seized power and united Iran, making the official religion Shi’a Islam. This was <strong>Safavids dynasty </strong>which ruled until 1722. This was an exciting period of art in the creation of textiles (the art of the loom) and manuscripts ( the art of the book).</p>
<p>It is estimated that today 1500 carpets and carpet fragments exist from the Safavid period.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bahram Gur Fights the Karg</em></strong><em>, </em>a <strong>folio</strong> from the <em>Great Il-Khanid Shahnama, </em>is a work in ink and opaque watercolor, using gold and silver on paper, measuring 8 by 5.5 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>This is real paper. The knowledge of how to make this was this diffused from China through the Mongol Empire.</p>
<p>There are <strong>57 surviving illustrations </strong>all created with a vibrancy of colour that depict characteristics of the Ilkhanid (Mongol) period of manuscripts. The pages are large in format and the space is often entirely painted or decorated.</p>
<p>Figures are monumental compared to the landscape, which means there is a  low horizon line. Both are stylized. Atmospheric perspective is used. There is a heavy use of black line for contouring. Text and drawing are combined on the pages.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>manual </strong>for royal conduct of Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire (like Machiavelli’s The Prince). It is a  sign of Mongol leaders’ worldliness and sophistication. The <strong>cross-cultural influences</strong> show acceptance, interest in trade and diffusion.</p>
<p>It is a work <strong>propaganda</strong> that links the Mongols to the great lineage of Persian rulers. Since this is a Shahnama that the Mongols commissioned, it illustrates that the Mongols are trying to liken themselves to the Persian rulers in this text by showing it is of interest to them. Mongols were foreign rulers, so this was especially important.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of this book were made. It is assumed that it was commissioned by a high-ranking member of the Ilkhanid court</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shahnama (Book of Kings)</strong> is a compilation of stories about Persian/Iranian rulers, originally from 1010. It tells the stories of ancient heroes and kings Pre-Islamic Iran. It is based on truth but aggrandized and some parts are fictional and sensationalized. Full of adventure, romance, and a guide to ethics, the  good kings are lauded.</p>
<p>One of the kings in the text is Bahram Gur. As Sassanian King from 430-438 CE. He wears a robe of European fabric to slay a fearsome horned wolf (the Karg). The setting shows influence from Chinese landscapes</p>
<h5><strong>Importance of Illustrated Books</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Illustrated books</strong> were a very important art form in Iran. It flourished  during a cultural Golden Age led by the Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire. This was the Mongol Empire in the Middle East.  Manuscript illumination was highly prized by Mongols.</p>
<p>The Mongols ruled as foreigners in a conquered land. They employed words and images to legitimize their rule and by linking themselves with great native Persian rulers of the past?</p>
<h5><strong>Diversity of Court</strong></h5>
<p>Mongol court was very diverse and cross-cultural, and this influence ended up in artwork. much of this diversity and cross-cultural influence ended up in the artwork. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persian story of Shahnama</li>
<li>Mongol patron in the Middle East</li>
<li>European realism / fabric / sense of space with low horizon line</li>
<li>Chinese landscape (trees, foliage) / calligraphic black line &amp; knowledge of paper</li>
<li>Persian technique of vibrant watercolors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>The Court of Gayumars, </em></strong><strong>folio from Shah Tahmasp’s <em>Shahnama</em> </strong>is a work comprised of ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on fine paper. The borders are sprinkled with gold. The <strong>285 illuminations</strong> took three years to complete. The lead artist on the project was <strong>Sultan Muhammad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>This work is also known as <strong><em>The Court of the Kayumars</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Lavishly Crafted</strong></h5>

<p><em><strong>Jahangir</strong></em><em><strong> Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</strong></em><strong> </strong>is also known as <em><strong>Jahangir</strong></em><em><strong> Enthroned on an Hourglass</strong></em>. This <strong>work on paper, by artist Bichitr</strong>,  is comprised of <strong>watercolor, gold and ink</strong> and measures <strong>10 inches tall.</strong></p>
<p>It is one of the <strong>symbolic paintings</strong> of Jahangir&#8217;s reign, eulogizing the power status of the contemporary dynasty. One of the many novel expression methods, the symbolism is distinctly handled.</p>
<p>To view you must concentrate on the <strong>aesthetics of composition</strong>, <strong>color palette</strong>, and a manipulative variation of <strong>figural sizes</strong>.</p>
<p>Bichitra, the painter, depicted various <strong>vegetal forms</strong> along with the <strong>calligraphic</strong> verses on the border. This trademark work combining many regional influences, illustrates Bichitra’s use of <strong>cross-cultural motifs</strong> to convey Mughal principles. Jahangir accepted European entry into the Indian subcontinent, which brought in <strong>western motifs in Indian art</strong>. This included Mughal miniatures are a part of larger books.</p>
<p>The thick and colorful <strong>floral border</strong> on the painting defines the Jahangir-era of Mughal art. The folio, as part of Muraqqa, establishes the spiritual trait of Jahangir’s personality by portraying the Sufi Sheikh as a prior figure after himself.</p>
<h5><strong>The Main Characters</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?resize=592%2C487&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="592" height="487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>The painting comprises five human figures of a reputed status, in decreasing order of visual size. The largest figure is that of <strong>King Jahangir</strong>, while the man in front of him is <strong>Sufi Sheikh Hussain</strong>, in a dimension little shorter than him. The king is adorned with jewelry as opposed to pale garb of the sheikh.</p>
<p>King Jahangir is handing over a book to the Sufi Sheikh Hussain, which he accepts in a shawl, avoiding the physical contact, as an imperial protocol.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-848" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-C.jpg?resize=375%2C752&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="375" height="752" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-C.jpg?w=167&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-C.jpg?resize=150%2C300&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Ottoman sultan, King James I and the artist make a cameo.</strong></p>
<p>The figure below the spiritual leader is an <strong>Ottoman sultan</strong>, followed by <strong>English King James I</strong>. Ottoman sultan&#8217;s turban-tied headdress distinguishes him as a foreigner to the Mughal court, while he awaits his chance to greet Jahangir. King James I, in his royal attire, gazes out of the painting, which is a typical style of European art.</p>
<p>The last figure is that of <strong>the artist</strong> himself, <strong>Bichitra</strong>. Despite the significance over the form of the King’s figure, the ochre-chrome yellow garb of Bichitra grabs the attention compulsively. However, the attire&#8217;s fashion indicates that he was a Hindu artist in the Mughal court. He is holding a miniature painting, which suggests his profession.</p>
<h5><strong>Adaptations of European Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from these, the other flying semi-human forms are <strong>putti figures</strong>, which are European-influenced characters.</p>
<p><strong>The halo</strong> behind the Jahangir’s head, and <strong>hourglass</strong>, are further adaptations of European forms. Concentric in kind, glaring flames around the head seemingly recognize his sun-like illuminated and authoritative demeanor.</p>
<p>At the same time, the crescent moon at the lower arc of the halo is a prevalent representation of spiritual enlightenment in Jain paintings. Symbolically, the crescent moon also narrates the endless cycle of day and night.</p>
<p><strong>King Jahangir</strong> is seated on a large and ornate <strong>hourglass</strong>. On the putti on the hourglass are engraving with an inscription that reads, “Allah is great. O Shah may the span of your reign be a thousand years”.</p>
<p>The hourglass is an emblematic attribute of the beginning of the new Islamic millennium, it begins with the rule of a knowledgeable Mughal ruler.</p>
<p>From these forms we can infer that Bichitra had been studying European artworks that were accepted by the king as gifts.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism</strong></h5>
<p>While figures are naturalistic and convincingly real, space itself is tipped <strong>upwards and flattened</strong>. A few areas are painted in gradual tonal values, while the rest is in flat application of colors. Artist has utilized a <strong>colorful palette</strong> with incredibly precise and intricate detailing. Notably, the division of backdrop helps in acquiring a rhythmic gaze over the work.</p>
<p>An ornate lower half, which apparently is a Persianate carpet, is replete with <strong>abstract, repetitive, and naturalistic design.</strong> In addition, the artist has neglected linear perspective to feature the content significantly.</p>

<p>The painting is enclosed in a <strong>group of rectangular frames</strong> that show a varying <strong>floral and calligraphic designs</strong>. Bordering with repetitive and small decorative cartouches, the background of the folio has floral arabesque. These <strong>floral motifs</strong> are inspired by the local flowers of the region.</p>
<p>At the cusp of the painting, on the vertical edges, the band depicts a calligraphic verse praising the king. The lower band expresses, “Though outwardly Shahs stand before him, he fixes his gaze on dervishes.”</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Mughal miniatures</strong> were often a part of a more comprehensive book project called <strong>Muraqqa</strong>. Murraqas describes lives of Mughal kings or elites. They were accessible to the selected and not common men. After the volume was written, it would be given to an artist with secluded pages to illustrate the relevant narratives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this folio was to render a spiritual and wise image of noble Mughal King Jahangir. As he preferred a spiritual Sufi Sheikh over the kings of the world, he is indicated to be a grand sovereign of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Mughal paintings are said to have used <strong>gold, silver, and lapiz lazuli</strong>, among other hues, for rendition. The usage of material depended on the project and the role it played over the larger mass. The <strong>colors</strong> were generally obtained from <strong>local natural resources</strong>. For example, white was made by grinding the conch, while black from the lamp residue.</p>
<p>In addition, Mughal kings followed greater political propaganda to disperse the might of the Mughal ruler. It also displayed Jahangir’s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety’s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.</p>
<h5><strong>Traditions</strong></h5>
<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance</strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.</p>
<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him</strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp’s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous <em>Hamzanama</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hamzanama </em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers</strong>.</p>
<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir’s court painters</p>
<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Bichitra (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to <em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em> under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases. <em>Baburnama</em>, <em>Akbarnama</em>, <em>Tujuk-I- </em><em>Jahangir</em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing ateliers</strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.</p>
<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.</strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved</strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette</strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts</strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.</p>
<p>During Akbar’s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong> was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir’s reign.</p>
