<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-778" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C557&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="557" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h3>
<h3>Theme: “Divinity, infinity, and unity”</h3>
<p><strong>Islamic art</strong> is inspired by and entirely comprised of Islamic religious messages and content (divine). Additionally, much Islamic artwork is created not only to last forever but uses calligraphic script which relays the word of God – which is infinite – to the umma (Muslims). Lastly, Muslims believed there was unity in ordered and geometric multiplicity. Therefore, works of Islamic art are comprised of multiple parts and many different patterns and forms that are visually unified to create an entire composition.</p>
<p>Islamic art is not specific to a time, place, region or medium. It also spans an incredible 1400 years! It is inspired by many sources including:<br />
<strong>Roman</strong><br />
<strong>Early Christian</strong><br />
<strong>Byzantine</strong><br />
<strong>Sassanian art of pre-Islamic Persia</strong><br />
<strong>Central Asia and China</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Key Terms</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Qur’an</strong>: The central religious text of Islam (Also written as Quran or Koran)</p>
<p><strong>Idolatry:</strong> The worship of idols.</p>
<p><strong>Monotheistic:</strong> Believing in a single god, deity, spirit</p>
<h5><strong>The Faith</strong></h5>
<p>Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet of God. An adherent of Islam is called a Muslim.</p>
<p>There are two denominations: the Sunni, which make up 75 to 90 per cent and the Shia which make up 10 to 20 percent.</p>
<p><strong>There are five pillars of Islam, which are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Shahadah (belief or confession of faith)</li>
<li>Salat (worship in the form of prayer)</li>
<li>Sawm Ramadan (fasting during the month of Ramadan)</li>
<li>Zakat (alms or charitable giving)</li>
<li>Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime)</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Historical Context 622-1600</strong></h5>
<p>The Muslim religion is one of five major religions in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad receives revelations from Angel Gabriel and God</li>
<li>He dies in 632. Muslims divided over succession issues (Sunni and Shi’a)</li>
<li>Umayyads (661-750)</li>
<li>Expand into North Africa and Iberia</li>
<li>Abbasids (750-1258) <strong>The Golden Age: mathematics, astronomy, medicine, natural sciences</strong></li>
<li>Mongols: Muslim world now <strong>divided between East</strong> (South and Central Asia, Iran) <strong>and West</strong> (Arabia, North Africa, Iberia)</li>
<li>Ottomans Capture Constantinople in 1453 with rapid expansion of religion and empire: <strong>theocracy</strong></li>
<li>Egalitarian religion that immediately dominates region and overcomes rivals</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Early Islamic Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Umayyad caliphate Period (661–750) </strong></h5>
<p>This is the formative period in Islamic art. The <strong>religious monuments</strong> erected under their patronage demonstrate an amalgam of Greco-Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian elements (decorative themes and motifs) while having an Islamic function and meaning.</p>
<p>The development of Islamic architecture were the requirements of the new religion. Customs necessitated a different usage of space. A royal ideology involved creating monuments which reflected their power and authority. The monuments were often constructed on sites of historical or symbolic significance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-792" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock..jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> in Jerusalem (691), the first major Umayyad architectural undertaking was built on a prominent site formerly occupied by Solomon’s Temple</li>
<li>the <strong>Great Mosques of Damascus</strong> (706) was the site of the former Roman temple and a fourth-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art in the Medieval Period (c. 900-1517 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>The Art of the Abbasid Period (750–1258)</strong></h5>
<p>They conquered the Umayyads (661–750) in 750, shifting the focal point of Islamic political and cultural life eastward from Syria to Iraq. <strong>Baghdad</strong> became the new Abbasid capital.</p>
<p>Today, virtually nothing remains from Abbasid Baghdad, so the nearby Samarra is used to understand the Abbasid art and architecture innovations.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way of carving surfaces, the so-called <strong>beveled style</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>arabesque</strong>: a repetition of abstract geometric or pseudo-vegetal forms which was widely used as wall decoration and popular in other media -wood, metalwork, pottery</li>
<li>an extensive use of <strong>color</strong> in decoration</li>
<li>possibly, the introduction of the <strong>technique of luster painting</strong> over a white glaze producing a glittering effect reminiscent of precious metal</li>
</ul>
<p>By the 10th century, the Muslim world was fragmented, and individual dynasties sprang up.</p>
<p>These dynasties had varying degrees of control over different parts of the lands where Islam was the dominant or a major religion. It was also the time of the European Christian crusades, which aimed to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims.</p>
<ul>
<li>In North Africa and the Near East, the <strong>Fatimids (909-1171)</strong>, emerged and ruled an area that includes present-day Egypt, Sicily, Algeria, Tunisia, and parts of Syria.</li>
<li>The major <strong>Turkic dynasties and people from Central Asia came</strong> to the forefront of Islamic politics and artistic creativity</li>
<li>The <strong>Seljuqs, Central Asian</strong> nomads eventually controlled Iran, Iraq and much of Anatolia</li>
<li>The <strong>Mamluks</strong>, the slave soldiers (mamluk, literally meaning “owned,”) controlled Syria and Egypt until 1517.</li>
<li>The invading <strong>Mongols</strong> and their great leader, <strong>Genghis Khan (c. 1162-1227)</strong>, Pax Mongolica</li>
<li>Blood-thirsty conquest and destruction of the Islamic world; established their rule over most Asia.</li>
<li>The <strong>West Asia</strong> (Iraq, Iran, Khorasan, Caucasus, and parts of Asia Minor) formed the “Il-Khanat,”lesser Khanat”</li>
<li>His legacy included the Pax Mongolica, the reconnection of the East and West (1279-1368), via the re-opened Silk Roads</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Seljuq Turks</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Nomadic Turkish warriors from Central Asia, established in the Middle East in 11th century</li>
<li>1055 founded the great Seljuk Sultanate (Turko-Persian Sunni) over Iran, Iraq, Syria</li>
<li>The dynasty brought revival, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians and acted as a buffer between Sunni, Shi’a, Christians, Mongols</li>
<li>Prevented the Fatimids of Egypt from spreading Shiite Islam</li>
<li>Created a barrier to Europe against the Mongol invaders</li>
<li>1071 at Manzikert they defeated the Byzantines conquering Anatolia; blocked inland expansion by the crusader states on the Syrian Coast in 12th century</li>
<li>Seljuk Turks are regarded as the ancestors of the inhabitants of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan.</li>
<li>Founded universities, patrons of art, literature; Persian astronomers, poets Omar Khayyám.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Ilkhanid Period (1256–1353)</strong></h5>
<p>In a short period of time, the Mongol control of most of Asia led to the so-called the Pax Mongolica, which reopened the <strong>Silk Road</strong> and created an environment of tremendous cultural exchange. <strong>East Asian elements are absorbed into the existing Perso-Islamic traditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decorative arts:</strong> textiles, metalwork, ivory-carving, ceramics furnished mosques, palaces</li>
<li>Major focus on <strong>illuminated and illustrated manuscripts</strong> (religious and secular)</li>
<li>An initial dynamic, almost dramatic phase followed by a more refined style</li>
<li>Great artistic development in manuscripts, such as those that recounted the Shahnama (or Book of Kings), the famous Persian epic</li>
<li><strong>Metalworkers </strong>created ewers, basins, cases in bronze/brass engraved, inlaid with silver</li>
<li>Also, great builders: mosques and Sufi shrines across Iran: Isfahan, Tabriz, and Yazd</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ilkhanid dynasty disintegrated in 1335 and local dynasties came to power in Iraq, Iran.</p>
<h5><strong>The Timurids (c. 1370-1507)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Timur (also known as Tamerlane)</strong>, who conquered and controlled all Central Asia, greater Iran, and Iraq, as well as parts of southern Russia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>The Timurids were outstanding builders of monumental architecture. Herat, in present-day Afghanistan, became the capital and cultural center of the Timurid empire.</p>
<h5><strong>The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1469) </strong></h5>
<p><strong>The medieval era of European al-Andalus</strong></p>
<p>When the Umayyad caliphate of Damascus was overthrown by the Abbasids in 750, the <strong>last surviving member of the Umayyad dynasty fled to Spain initiating the Umayyad emirate (756–929).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abd al-Rahman I (r. 756–88)</strong> made <strong>Córdoba </strong>his capital and unified al-Andalus under his rule with a firm hand, while establishing diplomatic ties with the northern Christian kingdoms, North Africa, and the Byzantine empire and maintaining cultural contact with the ‘Abbasids in Baghdad. Despite their open rejection of Abbasid political authority, the Umayyads of Córdoba emulated the opulent palatial arts of the centers of Abbasid power, Baghdad, and Samarra.</p>
<p><strong>The Almoravids (1062–1150), The Almohads (1150–1269), The Nasrids (1232-1492)</strong> of the southern Iberian Peninsula and western North Africa.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insistent pressure from Christian armies from the north, which successfully conquered Valencia, Játiva, and Jaén and made the Nasrids tribute-paying vassals in 1243.</li>
<li>Ends in 15th century after severe political crises in the Maghrib and the union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon through the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella.</li>
<li>Despite its precarious political situation, for over two and a half centuries Granada were the patrons of Islamic art in the Muslim West, attracting leading scholars and literati.</li>
<li><strong>Córdoba:</strong> the greatest intellectual center of Europe, with celebrated libraries and schools.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Islamic Art Later Period (c. 1517 –1924 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>This period is the era of the last great Islamic Empires.</p>
<h5><strong>The Ottoman Empire 1281-WW1</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Started in 14th century as a small Turkic state in Anatolia</li>
<li>Emerged in the second half of the fifteenth century as a major military and political force.</li>
<li>the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453 and the Mamluk Empire in 1517.</li>
<li>Dominated much of Anatolia, the Balkans, the Near East, and North Africa until after WWI</li>
<li>Best known for mosques in the late 15<sup>th</sup> and early 16<sup>th</sup> century</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Safavids 1501–1722</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the greatest dynasty of Iran</li>
<li>Established Shia Islam as the dominant faith of Iran</li>
<li>Arts: architecture, painting, manuscripts, and carpets all flourished under the Safavids.</li>
<li>the Safavids most outstanding ruler, Shah Abbas (r. 1587–1629)- greatest patron of the arts</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Mughals. 1526–1858</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Founded by Babur</li>
<li>Ruled over the largest Islamic state in the Indian subcontinent.</li>
<li>conquered the earlier sultanates of today northern Indian and Pakistan</li>
<li>Patrons of some of the greatest works of Islamic art: illuminated manuscripts and painting, and architecture, including the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>patrons</strong> of this time were the rulers and elite. These works were both refined and decorative, reflecting order. No religious figures were shown at this time.</p>
<p>Painting and sculpture used <strong>arabesque</strong> or “Arab-like” flowing, intricate, repetitive pattern derived from stylized organic motifs, usually floral. <strong>Examples include acanthus leaves, vines, and spirals.</strong> It is a French word that was derived from the Italian word Arabesco, which simply means Arabic style.</p>
<p><strong>Tessellations </strong>is the repetition of geometric designs.</p>
<p><strong>Calligraphy</strong> was considered the highest art form. It transmits the word of God to Muhammad. These were the most respected artists. Yet, most artists remained anonymous. It wasn’t until only later calligraphers would sign their works.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Islamic architecture has a wide scope from both secular to religious styles.</p>
<p><strong>Mosque: </strong>A place of worship for Muslims, like a Christian church or Jewish synagogue. A mosque will often have at least one <strong>minaret</strong>. In Arabic the word mosque is <strong>masjid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minaret: </strong>The tall slender tower of an Islamic mosque, from which the <strong>muezzin </strong>(the man who calls Muslims to pray) recites the adhan call to prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Mihrab: </strong>A semicircular niche in the wall of a mosque, that indicates the <strong>qibla</strong> (direction of Mecca), and into which the <strong>imam </strong>(man who leads prayer) prays.</p>
<p><strong>Hypostyle halls</strong> or unified open interiors were a popular type of mosque structure.</p>
<h5><strong>Early Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>Recognized immediately as Islamic architecture, the building of Mosques began after Muhammad’s time. It incorporated traditional Roman building traditions, along with the local traditions of incorporating Sassanid and Byzantine models.</p>
<p>Historically, mosques have been used as both <strong>meeting places and a space to pray</strong>. Early mosques are said to be based on Muhammad’s home in Medina, which is officially the first mosque.</p>
<p>One of the best preserved and earliest mosques is the <strong>Great Mosque of Kairouan</strong>, in Tunisia. Dating back to 670 CE, it contains architectural features that distinguish <strong>early mosque styles</strong>. This includes <strong>a minaret, large courtyard, surrounded by porticos and a hypostyle prayer hall.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Ottoman Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>During the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> century <strong>Ottoman mosques</strong> were found in the cities of Bursa and Edirne. These were developed from earlier Seljuk Turk architecture, but were also influenced by Byzantine, Persian, and Islamic Mamluk.</p>
<p>This architecture was perfected in the 16<sup>th</sup> century with massive domes, and vast interiors, all of which appeared weightless. There were square dome plans, slender cornet minarets and columns. Think: <strong>The Blue Mosque</strong>, in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
<h5><strong>The Safavid Dynasty</strong></h5>
<p>During this time architecture flourished with large mosques, palaces such as Ali Qapu, numerous well-planned gardens, and an immense bazaar. Ishan, which was the capital of both the Safavid and the previous Seljuk dynasties saw the most growth.  Think: <strong>The Imperial Mosque </strong>built in 1598.</p>
<h5><strong>Islamic Architectural Elements</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-780" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Architectural-Drawings.jpg?resize=800%2C488&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Architectural-Drawings.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Islamic-Architectural-Drawings.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Other Forms of Art</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Textiles</li>
<li>Ceramics</li>
<li>Calligraphy</li>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Glass</li>
<li>Metalwork</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Textiles</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Textile arts </strong>falls under the category of arts and crafts. It uses plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to craft objects.  Working with textiles predates Islamic times and have also been of great importance to Middle Eastern cultures.</p>
<p>With the growth of Islamic dynasties textile development was controlled regionally. The most important textiles created were <strong>carpets.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Carpet Production During the Ottoman Empire </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>1299 CE Turkish tribes in northwestern Anatolia founded the Ottoman state</li>
<li>1453 tribes conquer Constantinople and establish the Ottoman Empire</li>
<li>The empire grows and stretches to include parts of Asia, Europe, and Africa</li>
<li>1922 monarchy was abolished in Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>Carpets were considered a <strong>decorative item</strong> during the Ottoman Empire. Not only were carpets placed on floors, but walls and even doors.  In addition to providing beauty, carpets helped to supply additional warmth and insolation when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Silk and cotton</strong> were the most common blend of fibers within the weave of Ottoman carpets. These works were rich in symbolism and religious meaning.</p>
<p>The most notable area for silk carpets was the town of Hereke. Artisans were known to create works of the very finest weaves that found homes in royal palaces.</p>
<h5><strong>Persian Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Iranian Safavid Empire (1501–1786)</strong> were strong contributors to textile arts. Starting as a craft among nomads and peasants it quickly grew into an area of expertise and carpets from this area were in demand internationally.</p>
<p>Some examples to note include:</p>
<p><strong>Anhalt Northwest Persian Medallion </strong>(Metropolitan Museum of Art)</p>
<p>This 16<sup>th</sup> century carpet is made from cotton and wool</p>
<figure id="attachment_781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-781" style="width: 574px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-781" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Anhalt-Northwest-Persian-Medallion-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Art.jpg?resize=574%2C456&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="574" height="456" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Anhalt-Northwest-Persian-Medallion-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Art.jpg?w=574&amp;ssl=1 574w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Anhalt-Northwest-Persian-Medallion-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Art.jpg?resize=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-781" class="wp-caption-text">Anhalt Northwest Persian Medallion (Metropolitan Museum of Art)</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Floral Arabesque Carpet</strong> (Metropolitan Museum of Art)</p>
<p>This 17<sup>th</sup> century carpet is also made with cotton and wool. Notice the light and dark blue arabesques as well as the buds, rosettes, leaves and palmettos.</p>

<p><strong>Tree Carpet</strong> (Philadelphia Museum of Art)</p>
<p>This carpet has been attributed to the 16<sup>th</sup>&#8211; 17<sup>th</sup> century timeframe. It is a highly regarded example of a Persian carpet from the classic era.  Notice there are six long cypress trees in blue and green.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Further in this lesson we will look add the <strong>Ardabil Carpets</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Indonesian Batiks</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Carpets were not the only form of textiles. <strong>Batiks from Indonesia</strong> were also prized. These are cloths that are printed with design. In the dying process, wax is placed on sections where the artist does not want the color to be absorbed.  The process takes multiple steps to process a variety of colors within one design.</p>
<p>The creation of batiks predates Islam. Yet batiks reached a peak when royal Muslim courts produced not only cloth but garments.</p>
<p>In Islamic fashion cloth was produced with abstract and intricate design and for the most part were <strong>aniconic</strong>. In rare cases human and animal depictions can be found.</p>
<p>The appearance of <strong>pre-Islamic mythology</strong> is common, however. These images include <strong>Garuda</strong>, the immortal bird-god, known for strength and ferocity and defeating oceans full of snakes. These <strong>serpents </strong>are also part of batiks, as are <strong>puppets</strong> shaped in human form.</p>
<p>Today batiks still maintain importance. These artistic works are hung, worn, and used for wrapping the Quran.</p>
<h5><strong>Ceramics</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ceramics </strong>are another notable artform within Islamic art. Wonderful examples are evident in both pottery and building tiles.  Early pottery was left unglazed.</p>
<p>The first examples are <strong>opaque glazes</strong> which date back to the <strong>8<sup>th</sup> century </strong>and emerged through the <strong>Hispano–Moresque style</strong> in Adaluz or Muslim Spain. This type of glaze was achieved through using an <strong>opaque white tin-glaze.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hispano–Moresque style </strong>also introduced the ceramic technique of <strong>painting in metallic lusters</strong>. This gave pottery pieces an iridescent glaze by using transparent or semi-transparent glaze that was activated by first heating and then cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Hispano-Moresque style</strong> continued to flourish under <strong>Christian</strong> rule when elements from both religions appeared together in ceramic works.</p>
<p>The 9<sup>th</sup> century brought with it works in <strong>stonepaste </strong>from Iraq as well as <strong>lusterware </strong>from Persia and Syria. The influence of <strong>Chinese ceramics</strong> on Islamic artists in apparent in shape, technique, and decoration.</p>

<h5><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h5>
<p>Work in <strong>calligraphy</strong>, the art of writing in decorative form, took on great importance. <strong>Kufic</strong> is the earliest form of Arabic calligraphy and is distinct for its <strong>angular form</strong>.</p>
<p>Quranic verse is not the only purpose. Calligraphy is also used to <strong>inscribe poetry</strong>, and to illustrate both <strong>ownership</strong> and generous donations.</p>
<p>Calligraphy is incorporated into <strong>books, art, architecture, coins</strong>,<strong> tiles</strong>, and <strong>metal work</strong>, in secular and non-secular forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Islamic painting in medieval times was dominated by two forms, <strong>book painting</strong> and <strong>miniatures.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Book Painting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Persia, Syria, Iraq</strong>, and the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> sparked a growth in the use of <strong>Islamic book painting</strong> during late medieval times.  During the Ilkhanid dynasty in Persia, examples of beauteous, large<strong>, illuminated manuscripts </strong>emerged.</p>
<p>During the 13<sup>th</sup> century <strong>manuscript paintings</strong> were influenced by the Byzantines and Mongols. Mongols was the generic term for a group of people comprised of both Mongolic and Turkic tribes of the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p><strong>Maquamat</strong>, the plural form of <strong>Maqāma</strong>, is an early medieval text and type of literary genre. It illustrated the day-to-day life of the people of the time. It contained prose that rhymed, with snippets of spiritual poetry.</p>
<h5><strong>Miniatures</strong></h5>
<p>Small paintings on paper, also known as <strong>miniatures, </strong>were an artistic tradition in <strong>Persia</strong>. The Mughals of India and Ottomans of Turkey also produced these artworks from which Persian artists were highly influenced.</p>
<p><strong>Mughal</strong> artists were known for their realistic portraits, many of which are in profile, while <strong>Ottoman </strong>artists used a more stylized form. Subjects included idealized youths, animals, family, and picnic scenes, as well as works focusing on individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts</strong> were part of the court and therefore had to pertain to all the religious rules governing the elimination of human depiction. While miniatures for a more general audience enabled human form.</p>
<p>Looking at miniature paintings during this time one can see the <strong>Byzantine influence</strong> visually. This includes work in blue and gold, as well as angelic motifs. <strong>Chinese influence</strong> is also apparent in the use of flowers such as peonies, as well as well as mythological creatures including phoenixes and dragons.</p>
<p><strong>Muraqqa </strong>is an album in book form combining Islamic <strong>miniature paintings</strong> and calligraphy from many different artists. The word Muraqqa is a Persian word that translates into “that which has been patched together”. Books of this type were popular among collectors in the Islamic world.</p>
<h5><strong>Glassmaking </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic glassmaking</strong> was considered <strong>a luxury art</strong> for the wealthy. During the Middle Ages, Islamic glass had a reputation for being the best in Eurasia and was shipped to buyers in both Europe and China. Some of the finest examples of glass from this time were found in <strong>lamps for mosques</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Mosque Lamp</strong> (above) from the 14<sup>th</sup> century is attributed to Egypt and Syria. It is made from a colorless glass with a yellow tinge that was blown with an applied blown foot. It is both enameled and gilded. On view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 454.</p>
<p>During the 8<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> centuries glass was decorated with incised patterns or in relief, by cutting away sections of glass. <strong>Luster painting</strong>, which dates to 9<sup>th</sup> century Egypt was also popular. This was achieved with the application of metallic pigment during the glass making process. Sometimes threads of glass were created in different colored threads and then pulled into the main surface to be heated together. There are also examples of glass that has been <strong>gilded, painted, and enameled</strong>.</p>
<p>By the 1500s glassmaking expertise moved on to Venice, where many orders for mosque lamps were completed.</p>
<h5><strong>Islamic Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p>The inlay technique, where pieces of softer metals (such as <strong>copper, gold, and silver</strong>) were inlaid into harder metals (<strong>bronze or brass</strong>) were used, represents a high point in Islamic metalwork of the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Initially in the 12th century it was laborious. Imagine hammering wire into tiny grooves that were previously cut into the object. These were chiseled to about 1-mm deep recesses along the pattern lines. Later in the 14th century there was a shortage of silver, hammering the inlaid designs directly onto the roughened surface. This was more economical, but the inlays peeled off easily.</p>
<p><strong>Motifs and Symbols</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Kufic inscriptions</li>
<li>Decorative motifs showing birds, animals, geometric patterns, and vine tendrils</li>
<li>No human figures</li>
<li>This was forbidden according to a Koranic edict, which regards the human form in art as rivaling God’s creations.</li>

<p><em> </em><strong>The Kaaba </strong>located in <strong>Mecca, Saudi Arabia</strong>, is the holiest shrine in Islam.</p>
<p>Made from <strong>granite masonry, </strong>it is covered with<strong> silk curtain </strong>and<strong> calligraphy in gold and silver-wrapped thread. </strong>The silk curtain also known as <strong>kiswa</strong>, is replaced annually during the hajj. The monument measures <strong>43 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kaaba</strong> is the Arabic word for <strong>cube or square building.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Renovations and Additions</strong></h5>
<p>The structure has been <strong>renovated multiple times</strong>, and so has the surrounding mosque. <strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been set on fire and survived floods.  The black stone has been broken and reassembled with silver. The last major modifications were carried out in the 1950s by the government of Saudi Arabia to accommodate the increasingly large number of pilgrims who come on the hajj. Today the mosque covers almost 40 acres.</p>
<p>The <strong>door</strong> made of <strong>solid gold</strong> was added in 1982.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, is a large open space with <strong>colonnades on four sides</strong> and <strong>seven minarets</strong>, the largest number of any mosque in the world. At the center of this large plaza sits <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as well as many other holy buildings and monuments.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This important structure orients all mosques in the world. EVERY mosque is faced towards <strong>The Kaaba</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Prayer </strong></h5>
<p>Muslims <strong>pray</strong> <strong>five times per day</strong>. This is one of the five pillars of the faith.  These prayers are directed toward <strong>Mecca</strong> and <strong>The Kaaba</strong>, as they have been since 624 CE. All mosques are marked with a <strong>qibla</strong> to know in which direction they need to pray.</p>
<h5><strong>Pilgrimage</strong></h5>

<p>Pilgrimage to a holy site is a core principle of almost all faiths. All Muslims aspire to undertake the hajj, or the annual pilgrimage, to <strong>The Kaaba</strong> once in their lives. This is another fundamental principle of the faith.</p>
<p>Once in Mecca, pilgrims gather in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram around <strong>The Kaaba</strong>. They then walk around <strong>The Kaaba.</strong> The goal is to kiss and touch the <strong>Black Stone</strong>—al-Hajar al-Aswad—embedded in the eastern corner.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> is a square building with a small interior room. Placed on the corner is the <strong>Black Stone </strong>which is the only original piece that remains on the site.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>According to tradition, the first building was <strong>built by Old Testament figure Abraham (known as Ibrahim in Islamic) and his son. </strong>Abraham’s son with his servant Hagar was Ismail. It is believed to be a structure that Abraham and his son Ismail created. It was built close to where Hagar found water.</p>
<p>The original sanctuary was a simple roofed rectangular structure. It housed the <strong>Black Stone</strong> (given to Abraham by the angel Gabriel) and statues of pagan gods.</p>
<p>The site was a <strong>pre-Islamic</strong> pilgrimage run by the Qaresh tribe, to which Muhammad belonged.</p>
<p>It was rebuilt it in 608 CE with masonry and wood. A door was included above ground level to protect the interior from intruders and flood waters.</p>

<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> sits on the highest point of old <strong>Jerusalem, Palestine. </strong>It is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong> with a <strong>wooden roof</strong> decorated with <strong>glazed ceramic tile, mosaics</strong>, and <strong>gilt aluminum</strong> and <strong>bronze dome</strong>. The dome measures <strong>67 feet</strong> on each side, plus 67 feet for the width of dome, and the same measurement for the height of drum.</p>

<p>The domed wooden octagonal building is <strong>centrally planned </strong>with <strong>two</strong> <strong>ambulatories</strong> that encircle the stone in the middle. The <strong>first ambulatory</strong> has 16 columns in its arcade. The <strong>second ambulatory</strong> has 24 columns in its arcade. This area is decorated with mosaic inscriptions from the Quran.</p>
<p>Notice in the arcade that the voussoirs are alternating colors. This is typical for Islam.</p>

<h5><strong>Entering Paradise</strong></h5>
<p>In Islam, there are <strong>8 levels of Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>8 x 2 = 16</p>
<p>8 x 3 = 24</p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Influences</strong></h5>
<p>At the time Islam was a very new religion and determined its artist influences cross culturally.</p>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock was </strong>Influenced by <strong>Byzantine</strong> centrally planned buildings like San Vitale. They also borrowed the Byzantine tradition of <strong>mosaic work</strong>.  Mosaics on this building use <strong>tessellation</strong> or polygonal shapes that repeat without gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Roman influence</strong> can be seen in <strong>mausolea</strong>, (burial places for Roman emperors were circular) and the <strong>Roman dome</strong> (Pantheon). They were also Influenced by <strong>columns</strong> taken from Roman monuments (<strong>spolia</strong>) and the <strong>arcade</strong>.</p>

<p>All decoration is <strong>aniconic</strong> meaning it is nonrepresentational and purely geometric . Here is why.</p>
<p>Muslims believed that <strong>mathematics</strong> was an indication that God controlled and had created the entire universe. <strong>Tessellations </strong>and mathematical designs help to reinforce this idea.</p>
<p>Muslims took the second commandment very strictly. It reads, “Thou shalt have no graven images”.  This was interpreted by Muslims as meaning there should not be anything representational in any religious art whatsoever</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Original function still debated – but it is a shrine, NOT a mosque</li>
<li>Symbol of caliphate strength</li>
<li>Testament to the power of the new Islamic faith</li>
<li>Pilgrimage site: Muslim pilgrims circumambulate the rock at the center of the building</li>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> is the earliest surviving Islamic building. It was created during the Umayyad period and the 1<sup>st</sup> caliphate of Islam.</p>
<p>It was built under the patronage of Abd al-Malik, who was the most important Umayyad caliph,  in the midst of a civil war</p>
<p>Whether there was a Byzantine church on this site, or near it, is still debated. Yet the Byzantine church style was still a huge influence on this building.</p>

<p>The <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba</strong>, stands in<strong> Córdoba, Spain. </strong>This magnificent architectural structure is made from <strong>stone masonry</strong>.</p>
<p>It was built here for the practical reason. The land was already available and flat. The site was recognized as an important structure. An entire town was built around it. The work was used to show religious and cultural supremacy over the Romans.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/56-Great-Mosque-Plan.gif?resize=490%2C700&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="490" height="700" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The floor plan is the one of three kinds for mosques: <strong>Hypostyle Hall</strong>, Four-Iwan, Central Plan.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-799" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?resize=990%2C604&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="604" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mosque-Comparison-Drawing.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The main building is comprised of the <strong>hypostyle hall. </strong>Through the use of repeated geometry, the hall seems larger than it is.  There are 514 <strong>double-horseshoe-arch</strong> columns, with alternating red and white <strong>voussoirs. </strong>Columns are Roman <strong>spolia</strong> from the temple here. Horseshoe arches are common feature of Visogoth Spanish architecture, which was then adopted by Muslims in Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Qiblah wall</strong> and <strong>mihrab</strong> are designated on the back wall. <strong>Mihrabs</strong> typically face Mecca and the Kaba which is what Muslims must specifically direct their prayers towards. However, this mosque does not face Mecca. It seems to be a mistake on the original understanding of geography by the Muslims who built it. In addition, it was originally a church and Muslims were not able to change the foundation to reorient the mosque towards Mecca.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba </strong>is a place for worship, prayer and contemplation. Hypostyle hall mosque encourages the viewer to contemplate the space and to seek out the qiblah wall which contains the mihrab. Here they must direct prayer.  to the mihrab</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the</strong> <strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba.</strong></h5>
<p>The courtyard contained a fountain, a covered walkway encircling the courtyard, a minaret, and an orange grove. Oranges were symbols of Cordobans.</p>
<p><strong>Qiblah wall</strong> is the wall that people must find. because it points towards the Kaaba in Mecca.  It also contains the <strong>mihrab.</strong> This is an empty arch on the qiblah wall. Mosque-goers pray towards this, not this. It is an empty arch because there can be no images of religious figures represented in Muslim religion.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>This is an example of<strong> Moorish</strong> culture. Muslims once ruled over Spain, or <strong>Al-Andalus</strong> as it was called in Arabic. <strong>Cordoban Caliphate </strong>began with exiles from the previous caliphate ,Umayyads. Established by Abd al-Rahman I, who ran away to Spain and established control over Iberia, he sponsored elaborate building programs. This became the center of a brilliant Golden Age for Isla.</p>
<p><strong>Great Mosque of Córdoba </strong>is one of the oldest structures still standing from when the Muslims ruled Al-Andalus.</p>
<p>There was originally a temple on the site to Janus, the Roman god of time, both past and future. It was converted into a church by Visogoths, in 572 CE.  Then, it was made into a mosque. Following this, it was totally rebuilt by the Cordoban Caliphate. Later, it was made into a Gothic church, with buttresses and pointed vaults added. A Renaissance style nave was eventually constructed.</p>
<p>Today, it is still a Catholic church.  Beginning in early 2000s, Muslims petitioned the Church to allow them to worship here and have since been consistently denied.</p>

<strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>in <strong>Isfahan, Iran,</strong> is made from <strong>stone, brick, wood, plaster</strong>, and <strong>glazed ceramic tile.</strong> It is positioned in the center of the old city. Since it was enlarged and added on to for many years, it shares walls with surrounding buildings and is an odd shape.</p>
<p>This is the second of <strong>three mosque styles</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hypostyle Hall</li>
<li><strong>Four-iwan</strong></li>
<li>central plan</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Four-iwan Mosque Style</strong></h5>
<p>This style of mosque, of which <strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) </strong>is a prime example, has a large courtyard with four open vaulted rooms or <strong>iwans</strong> open to the courtyard.  This courtyard contains water. On holy days, Muslims <strong>must wash their hands and feet before entering a mosque.</strong></p>
<p>The four <strong>iwans</strong> are framed by <strong>pishtaqs</strong>. These are rectangular frames around pointed arched openings. Iwans help to bring light and ventilation into what would otherwise be dark rooms.</p>
<h5><strong>The Color Blue</strong></h5>
<p>Use of <strong>blue colored tile</strong> in mosaic tessellations is very distinctive for <strong>Safavid</strong> architecture. It uses  aniconic imagery since this is a mosque. Notice the curving, decorative lines, or <strong>arabesques. </strong>These are used as a veneer over a brick core.</p>

<h5><strong>The Ogival Arch</strong></h5>
<p>The architecture uses the <strong>pointed arch</strong>, an influence that comes from the Christian West. This arch is  often called an <strong>ogival arch</strong> since it pinches slightly at the top.</p>
<h5><strong>Qiblah Iwan</strong></h5>
<p>This is the location of the <strong>mihrab</strong>. It is the only one marked with two <strong>minarets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Muezzin</strong> will call people to prayer from the minarets</li>
<li>Reserved for use by rulers</li>
<li>Constructed in 1310 by Mongols (Ilkhanid) rulers</li>
<li>Can see the <strong>minbars</strong> (short flight of steps used as a platform by a preacher in a mosque)</li>
<li>Iwan is filled with <strong>muqarnas </strong>(3D triangle that curls out towards you; layered over one another to make the interior of an arch grow out <strong>towards you)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Great Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh)</strong> is a mosque for personal prayer, worship, and contemplation. It is also the center of community and a  way of bringing people together and facilitating community. The courtyard creates a tranquil space with water where the viewer can sit and relax.</p>
<p>The mosque was connected to several pedestrian walkways originally. This facilitated not only public mobility but also commercial activity in connection to the mosque, as it was located near a large market.</p>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Isfahan was the capital of the Seljuk Turk empire</li>
<li>The mosque was expanded upon for a period of 1,000 years (8<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries)</li>
<li>In 700 CE, it was just a small mosque with the courtyard</li>
<li>11<sup>th</sup> century: core structure of the 4-iwan model was added by Seljuk Turks (under the reign of Malik Shah I, ruled 1072-1092)</li>
<li>Later rulers constantly expanded it (Mongol period – Ilkhanid; Timurid; Safavid</li>

<p><strong>Mosque of Selim II</strong>, located in <strong>Edirne, Turkey</strong>, is a building made of <strong>brick and stone</strong>, with <strong>a dome measuring 31 meters across.  </strong>This mosque is designed in a <strong>Central Plan</strong>, which is one type of three mosque types. The other two types are Hypostyle Hall and Four-Iwan.</p>

<h5><strong>The Exterior</strong></h5>
<p>The exterior has elegantly stacked domes with towering minarets or <strong>pencil minarets</strong>. <strong>Muezzin</strong>, or person who will lead the prayer would call everyone to prayer from the minarets.</p>
<p>Here, a complex system of buttresses were used to hold up the massive weight of the dome. It is over 101 feet across, which is larger Hagia Sophia’s dome.</p>
<p>The building consists of 384 windows.</p>
<h5><strong>The Interior</strong></h5>

<p>The dome rests upon <strong>eight</strong> <strong>piers</strong>. The architect used <strong>squinches</strong> to transfer a circle into an octagon. There is <strong>Aniconic </strong>decoration with mosaic <strong>tessellation, </strong>or repetition of geometric design. The alternating red and white <strong>voussoirs </strong>are typical for Islamic architecture.</p>
<p>The <strong>mihrab</strong> is visible from almost any spot in the building even though it is not under the middle dome. It is pushed back into an apse-like alcove. Again, centrally planned spaces are symbolic and work nicely to unite people but are not actually designed to accommodate prayers or organized activities.</p>
<p>The <strong>muzzin</strong>, or prayer leader, had has platform under the center of the dome .</p>
<p>In this floor plan at  the front of the mosque sits a rectangular court, with an area equal to that of the mosque.</p>

<p>The mosque  is a place for prayer, contemplation, and community. Politically, mosques were a way for the Ottomans to show they had beat the Byzantine Empire.  It also symbolized Islam over Christianity.</p>
<p>The mosque’s design was based on Hagia Sophia. It was a statement of triumph to both the patron,  and the architect.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Patron and Location</strong></h5>
<p>Ottoman Sultan<strong> Selim II</strong>, the new Ottoman ruler, was the son of Son of Suleyman the Magnificent, who brought the Ottomans to the greatest territorial height. This mosque was built at the peak of Ottoman power in the Middle East.</p>
<p>When the rulers commissioned the work, he chose this spot specifically for the mosque. It was on the highest and would dominate the skyline.</p>
<p>Edirne, where the mosque is located, was the capital city of the Ottomans. It was the westernmost Ottoman city. For Europeans who may have encountered the city, it strategically made a good first impression.</p>
<p>This was the center of the community. The mosque had a school, or <strong>madrasas</strong> for studying Prophet Muhammad and his sayings. There was also a market, soup kitchen, bath, hospital, hospice, and cemetery.  The mosque was the meeting point to draw everyone together.</p>

<p><strong>Alhambra Palace</strong>, in <strong>Granada, Spain</strong>, is a <strong>whitewashed adobe</strong> made from <strong>stucco, wood, tile, paint and gilding</strong>. It is comprised of 1 mile of walls, 32 towers. It rests upon Sabika Hill, over 26 acres of land. This was a strategic vantage point for defense.</p>
<p>The exterior is plain and austere. There are many open passageways and courtyards, so sun and air could be freely admitted.</p>
<h5><strong>The Alcazaba and Royal Palace</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Alhambra Palace</strong> was originally an <strong>alcazaba </strong>or Islamic fortress for military purposes, with a citadel and barracks for elite guard. It was also a Royal Arab residence. This beautiful work of architecture was also propaganda to show off the power of the Nasrid kings.</p>
<p>It was a place to bring guests or ambassadors to show them the luxury and lavish life of the Nasrids. The elite enjoyed elaborate courtyards and gardens, which often included water. This created a sense of harmony and tranquility. Water is a major decorative element in Islam that promotes reflection, cooling, and peaceful qualities.</p>
<p>After the conquests of the Muslims in Spain, it was converted into a Christian Palace. Then, it was  converted into a Christian palace after the conquest of Muslims in Spain.</p>

<h5><strong>A Walk Through </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Alcazaba</strong> is the is the oldest part of the Alhambra. It was built by Mohammed I, who used it as his place of residence. Historians believe it was built over a Roman fortress. The rulers lived here until the rest of the palace was complete.</p>
<p>The Palace was organized around two central courtyards and included watch towers. It was highly decorated and made to feel like a “Paradise on Earth.”</p>

<p><strong>The Court of the Lions</strong>  is an oblong court that was surrounded by 124 slender columns. Each column connects to an arch that uses <strong>muqarnas. </strong>The columns and muqarnas arches were supposed to be reminiscent of palm trees that let light in but create patterns of shadow on the ground.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>lion fountain in the center</strong>, built and engineered by Muhammad V. It is supported by twelve lionesses. Each hour on the hours a lioness would produce water out of her mouth, as a representation of a clock keeping time.</p>
<p>The fountain utilized a complex hydraulics system, using two water channels that formed a cross in the center of the courtyard. The fountain apparently baffled all who saw it, even inspiring a poem on the fountain by Ibn Zamrak.</p>
<p>Although, not designed with anatomical accuracy, it was intended to show strength and power. Historians speculate that the four to the two water channels is associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The water flowing through suggests giving life. Although the twelve lions represent the 12 hours on a clock, they could also represent the 12 signs of the zodiac.</p>

<p>This hall was in the center of a series of rooms where the sultana and her family lived. It had a highly sophisticated and refined interior.</p>
<p>The ceiling was made from 5000 muqarnas pieces reflecting light to create a delicate and open interior. It contained eight studded star shapes to represent the eight levels of paradise. There were 16 windows spread across two levels.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hall of Two Sisters</strong> was not named for siblings, rather it was named for two large twin marble flagstones that make up the floor.</p>

<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in <strong>Agra, Uttar Pradesh, in Northern India</strong>, is an ancient <strong>Indian mausoleum</strong> representing exquisite <strong>Indo-Islamic architecture</strong> that measures <strong>240 feet</strong> across and sits on <strong>42 acres</strong>. The building is made with <strong>stone masonry</strong> and <strong>marble</strong>, along with <strong>an inlay of precious and semiprecious stones</strong>.</p>
<p>Masons, marble workers, mosaicists, and decorators worked under the supervision of <strong>Ustad Ahmad Lahori</strong>, architect of the emperor.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is not a singular marvel, rather it is a large complex, with the <strong>main tomb</strong> flanked by <strong>twin mosques</strong> that are identical in size. The complex also consists of a <strong>guest house</strong></p>
<p>There are also the grounds filled with impressive <strong>gardens</strong> called Chahar bagh, which used the Persian style.</p>
<p>A thoughtful blend of Persian, Turkic, and Indian styles, it is one of the finest instances of <strong>Mughal art and architecture.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>More About the Mungal Kingdom</strong></h5>
<p>The Mughal kingdom had expanded its Islamic rule over vast areas of northern and central India. Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces.</p>
<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the Taj Mahal is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Taj Mahal epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, <strong>bringing many Persian artists to India</strong>.</p>
<p>The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many <strong>Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists</strong> were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of <strong>miniature paintings</strong>. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing, and being influenced by indigenous Indian art.</p>
<p>Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.</p>
<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s</strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of Islamic and Indian architecture.  Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the Taj Mahal as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule.</p>
<p>Many <strong>motifs from Hindu culture</strong> had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style</strong>, some plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian.</p>
<h5><strong>Artists and Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Mughals were known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, it allowed for easy access to water. Moreover, Agra was known as a “riverfront” city</p>
<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent.</p>
<p>The <strong>five principal elements</strong> of the complex, which includes the <strong>main gateway</strong>, <strong>garden</strong>, <strong>mosque</strong>, <strong>jawāb </strong>(literally “answer”, a building mirroring the mosque), and <strong>mausoleum</strong> (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.</p>
<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose and Symbolic Meaning of Taj Mahal</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
<h5>Projecting unique beauty, the <strong>mausoleum</strong> is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King, and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb.</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Taj Mahal is the <strong>symbol of unconditioned love</strong>. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the Taj Mahal has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaj by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.</p>
<p>As it is built on the <strong>raised platform</strong>, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural <strong>metaphor for Paradise</strong>. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.</p>
<p>Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is a <strong>symbol of compassion and royalty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> emphasizes the <strong>power </strong>vested in royal Mughal patrons.</p>
<h5><strong>Significance of Geography </strong></h5>
<p>Shah Jahan decided to build <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.</p>
<h5><strong>Entering the Complex</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-811" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=975%2C556&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="556" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone</strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna river, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal is built on a square and <strong>raised platform or a plinth</strong>. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of <strong>eight paradises</strong>, rendering the plan <strong>octagonally</strong>. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-814" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=990%2C474&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="474" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?w=455&amp;ssl=1 455w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>central chamber</strong> with an onion-shaped dome is <strong>flanked by four minarets</strong> at the four corners of the plinth. Mounted with a finial and a crescent moon, the dome is a golden spot of wonder. At the lower lever, <strong>four smaller-sized domes</strong> surrounding the central dome. Each small dome comprises a <em><strong>chhatri</strong></em><em> </em>(kiosk), enclosing a balcony.</p>
<p>The <strong>arched gate</strong> to enter the tomb is called <em><strong>iwan</strong></em><strong><em>.</em></strong> It is framed by a rectangular and decorated surface called <em><strong>Pishtaq</strong></em><strong>.</strong> The gates and other walls project <strong>chamfered corners</strong>, a peculiar style of Mughal architecture.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the four minarets are tilted away from the central dome, as a precautionary act to avoid damage to the main structure, especially during an occurrence of a natural calamity. Minarets also have a <em><strong>chhatri </strong></em>and a staircase to reach the top. They are associated with the religious duty of calling for daily prayers. The <em><strong>muezzin</strong></em>, the official assigned the announcing duty, calls the public for the <em><strong>namaz</strong></em><em> </em>or prayer from these minarets.</p>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-815" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Plan-of-the-Complex.jpg?resize=700%2C525&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Plan-of-the-Complex.jpg?w=351&amp;ssl=1 351w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-209.-Plan-of-the-Complex.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Bodies at Rest</strong></h5>
<p>The central chamber places the two cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaj. Shah Jahan died thirty years after his wife. Mumtaj died after giving birth to their 14th offspring in 1631.</p>
<p>The real <strong>sarcophagi</strong> are safely stored at the lower level. The sarcophagi are ornate with <strong>calligraphy</strong>. The surface calligraphic verses from Quran are <strong>inlaid in precious stones</strong>. The technique is known as Pietra dura, which uses cut and polished colored stones. The verses refer to the paradise and day of judgment, wherein God royally and dutifully rewards the faithful.</p>
<p>The tomb shows <strong>floral patterns</strong> as animal or human figures are prohibited, as per Islam protocols. In addition, the <em><strong>jali</strong></em><em> </em>or mesh decorative work and <strong>lapidary</strong> relating to the engraving, cutting, or polishing of stones and gems is frequently observed.</p>

<h5><strong>A Place of Wonder </strong></h5>
<p>Considered as <strong>one of the seven man-made wonders of the world</strong>, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is known as the <strong>Crown of the Palace</strong>. Originally, it was known as Rauza-i-munawwara, which means illuminated tomb. It is situated in Agra, a northern city of India.</p>
<p>In 1983, UNESCO designated the Taj Mahal and the complex as <strong>World Heritage site</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Yesterday and Today</strong></h5>
<p>During the time the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> was built, the Indian continent observed an entry of Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, incrementing the business with Indian counterparts. The presence of Europeans also appears in many Mughal paintings, proving their acceptance in Mughal courts.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan was a promoter of arts and culture, which did not pass onto the next Mughal ruler and his son Aurangzeb. Hence, Aurangzeb&#8217;s disinterest and disengagement led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving the ground for Britishers to take charge by the 18th century.</p>
<p>Taj Mahal oversees millions of worldwide tourists every year. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns, resulting in many newer rules and regulations for the visitors. Nevertheless, the penchant of Shah Jahan for erecting a wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection is path breaking. Continuing to draw visitors to Agra to glimpse this architectural beauty, even after four hundred years, Taj Mahal continues to inspire awe.</p>

<p>The word <strong>folio</strong> simply means a <strong>page in a book</strong>. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p>The page uses <strong>calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used by early scribes is known as <strong>Kufic. </strong>This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>illuminated manuscript</strong> or a medieval Biblical book (5th – 14th centuries). Illuminated can <strong>refer to vibrancy of color</strong> or illuminated can refer to <strong>the viewer’s enlightenment while reading the text</strong>.</p>
<p>On each page there is <strong>Greek text on top and corresponding image below. </strong>Only 48 out of 192 pages survive. Originally the <strong>pages were purple</strong> which was an expensive dye. Potentially a royal patron? The <strong>lettering was silver</strong> and has now tarnished.</p>
<p><strong>Images use a continuous narrative</strong> that bends upon itself because there is not enough room. We understand that the figures on the bottom are closer, even though there is no differentiation of size.</p>

<p><strong>Vellum from calfskin was used</strong>. It needed to be from calves because of how supple and fatty their skin is. Vellum was made by slaughtering the calf.

<p><strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>is an example of<strong> decorative arts </strong>that is both beautiful and utilitarian. Made of  solid <strong>ivory</strong> from the tusk of an elephant, the work stands <strong>6 inches tall</strong>.  Ivory was expensive, durable, smooth, elegant, and easily carved, making it a highly desirable material. This pyxis was made from the famous workshop of Madinat al-Zahra</p>
<p>Islamic art is not always <strong>aniconic</strong>, meaning it does not use animal or human form. It is religiously <strong>aniconic</strong> only. In non-religious or secular and for private use, representational images can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong>: literally means “<em>fear of emptiness</em>” and refers to artwork that is completely full of imagery. This decorative work is an example of this. The work is dense, overcrowded, and intricate, with no space for recession.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1462" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-57.-Teacher.jpg?resize=405%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="405" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-57.-Teacher.jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-57.-Teacher.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Politically Utilitarian</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>was a gift to 18-year-old al-Mughira, son of a caliph, as a coming of age present. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is cylindrical box with a separate lid. The one has a <strong>utilitarian</strong> purpose, as it was used for cosmetics. Royal men wore makeup, particularly eye makeup, as a sign of status.</p>
<p>Ivory objects were given to royalty on important occasions. Think marriage, birth, and coming of age.</p>
<p>Such works expresses the political authority of the Spanish Umayyads.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This work is decorated with four eight-lobed medallions. This is symbolism of the number eight. It represents the eight levels of Paradise. There are carved falconers, griffons, peacocks, birds, and animals to be hunted.</p>
<p><strong>Royal iconography</strong> includes courtly figures and lute players. Falcons were a symbol of Umayyad legitimacy and power. Date palm trees may allude to the lost Umayyad lands of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The two lions symbolize the Umayyads.</p>
<p>The inscription reads: “God’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him.”</p>

<p><strong>Basin <em>(Baptistère de St. Louis</em>) </strong><strong>Muhammad ibn al-Zain </strong>measures <strong>20 inches wide</strong> and is made with <strong>brass </strong>and <strong>inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p>Brass is a mix of copper and zinc. For a work to be inlaid with silver and gold, it requires delicate hammering. Artists used the combination of metals to provide contrast and emphasis and to allow the viewer to see the figures easier. The entire work in decorated, even inside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-835" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=700%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="405" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?w=567&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-188.-B.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Since this work is a secular piece there is a relaxation of <strong>aniconism </strong>and it instead contains representational imagery.  Figures are <strong>stylized</strong>, dense, overlapping, with no clear sense of space parallel to picture plane.</p>
<p>Note: Figures do not have halos, rather this has been done to help highlight the figures’ faces and distinguish them from the surrounding inlaid silver work.</p>
<h5><strong>Original Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended for a wealthy Muslim courtly secular audience. It was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk as a banqueting vessel or basin for handwashing.</p>
<h5><strong>Eventual Function</strong></h5>
<p>Somehow this work ended up in France. It was used during the 17<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> centuries to baptize French royal children (<strong>appropriation</strong>) although the association with St. Louis is probably fictional.</p>
<p>WHY would the French royalty be okay using an Islamic object to BAPTIZE French ROYAL children? The answer is unknown, as is the answer to how the Basin ends up in French royal hands</p>

<p>Since this was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk, it probably depicts specific individuals and Mamluk battles. <strong>Iconography </strong>is very dense and complex. It has not been interpreted much by historians and the meanings are probably lost</p>
<p>The <strong>exterior</strong> has four figures in roundels, each on horseback. Two are hunting. One is drawing a bow and arrow. One is holding a club. These may be personifications of the different aspects of Mamluk horsemanship. There are Mamluk officials, macebearers, ax-bearers, and bow-bearers.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom bands</strong> are registers of animals that decorate the basin.</p>
<p>The common symbol is the <strong>fleur de lys</strong>. Ultimately this became the symbol of the French family, which may explain the use by the French, but this was also the symbol of the Mamluk sultans.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mamluks</strong> were warrior slaves in Egypt who took control of several Muslim regions. They established a <strong>dynasty from Egypt to Syria from 1250-1517</strong> when Ottomans conquered them.</p>
<p>Political and military dominance led to wealth which led to a flourishing artistic culture known for brass.</p>

<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet,</strong> from <strong>Iran</strong>, is made from <strong>silk </strong>warps and wefts with <strong>wool </strong>pile. The wool was added because it naturally absorbs dyes, which are all natural come from items such as pomegranates and indigo. Rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, natural arabesques make for a stunning carpet.</p>
<p>The carpet measures <strong>34 by 17 feet</strong>. There are <strong>340 knots per square inch</strong>.  That means there are <strong>over 28 million knots in The Ardabil Carpet. </strong>This means it was not only very plush but also highly intricate AND durable. It is interesting to note that a commercial rug today has only 80-160 knots per square inch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Portable, though its size was massive</li>
<li>Made of expensive silks and wool</li>
<li>Dyes used to color the carpet are natural, include pomegranate rind and indigo</li>
<li>Ten weavers worked on the carpet at any given time</li>
<li>340 knots per square inch (commercial rugs today have 80-160 knots per inch)
<ul>
<li>That means it had over 28 million knots</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Why was this Created?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> was <strong>made for prayer</strong> in the funerary shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili. The carpet is one of a matching pair and was made when the shrine was enlarged under the reign of Shah Tahmasp He was a very famous and popular Sufi mystic.</p>
<p>This shrine was considered sacred to Safavid rulers and subjects and therefore it received many offerings. It remained at the shrine for three centuries until they were removed to England.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer carpets</strong> like these decorated the floors of mosques, shrines, and homes – anywhere prayer occurred. Muslims must pray 5 times a day, oriented towards Mecca. Prayer carpets help to unify all members  as they pray together and create sense of community</p>
<p>Carpets like these were also considered works of art and Iranian carpets were prized for their intricate designs. Carpets were sold by craftspeople across Islamic lands and into China and Europe.  The Ardabil Carpet however attests to the great skills achieved in carpet by the people of north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Made the Ardabil Carpet?</strong></h5>
<p>It was made by a royal weaving factory, overseen by Maqsud Kashan. It is estimated that <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> would have taken four years to make, if 10 people were working on weaving it. Men were the weavers, even though women often did the actual weaving, but  the size and importance “necessitated and required” men.</p>
<h5><strong>Changing the Rules</strong></h5>
<p>Carpet used for religious purpose are supposed to be aniconic. The Ardabil Carpet it is not! It does however have two prayer lamps designed on it. These are likely to mimic lamps found on the ceiling of this funerary shrine, which would have created visual unity between the rug and its surroundings</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> is full of typical Islamic designs. There are geometric patterns, florals, and vegetative designs. Such designs belong to a class known as <strong>Northwest Medallion Carpets</strong>, which is one of 30 classifications for Persian carpets.</p>
<p>Ten colors were used in the design, and all were naturally sourced from items such pomegranates, the yellow spice saffron and indigo for the deep blue background. The white or cream shades were left naturally undyed.</p>

<p><strong>Northwestern Medallion Carpets</strong> are generally dominated by a central medallion.  In the center of <strong>The Ardabil Carpet</strong> there is a gold medallion with a light blue roundel in the center, with floating open lotus blossoms. From the medallion 16 ovals circulate. Each is a different color in either red, green, or cream.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-838" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191.-B.png?resize=420%2C326&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="420" height="326" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191.-B.png?w=420&amp;ssl=1 420w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191.-B.png?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To the left and right there are decorative lamps. Cartouches or rectangular shapes that were used for calligraphy line the borders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?resize=728%2C355&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="728" height="355" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-191-C.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Inscription</strong></h5>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an inscription of <strong>poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<p><em>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</em></p>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The <strong>fourth line</strong> provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>A Comparison of the Two Carpets</strong></h5>
<p>In Persia in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it was not uncommon for important carpets to be woven in pairs. The Los Angeles carpet, although smaller after having had outer borders removed, is identical the Albert and Victoria carpet. The central medallion for example measures each other precisely.</p>
<p>The only thing that differs is the wool quality and weaving techniques in knot count, texture, and pile length. The London carpet has between 340 knots per square inch, while the Los Angeles carpet has 380 to 420 knots per square inch. Through this research the conclusion was made the rugs were not woven simultaneously, but within the same year. Some art historians believe that the Los Angeles carpet was woven first, because of the finer weave.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet is </strong>one of the oldest Islamic carpets in the word. It is named after the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.  This town was the home was a Sufi saint named Safi al-Din Ardabili who died in 1334. Sufism is Islamic mysticism.</p>
<p>After the saint died, his followers continued to grow and expand. Then, in 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma’il, seized power and united Iran, making the official religion Shi’a Islam. This was <strong>Safavids dynasty </strong>which ruled until 1722. This was an exciting period of art in the creation of textiles (the art of the loom) and manuscripts ( the art of the book).</p>
<p>It is estimated that today 1500 carpets and carpet fragments exist from the Safavid period.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bahram Gur Fights the Karg</em></strong><em>, </em>a <strong>folio</strong> from the <em>Great Il-Khanid Shahnama, </em>is a work in ink and opaque watercolor, using gold and silver on paper, measuring 8 by 5.5 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>This is real paper. The knowledge of how to make this was this diffused from China through the Mongol Empire.</p>
<p>There are <strong>57 surviving illustrations </strong>all created with a vibrancy of colour that depict characteristics of the Ilkhanid (Mongol) period of manuscripts. The pages are large in format and the space is often entirely painted or decorated.</p>
<p>Figures are monumental compared to the landscape, which means there is a  low horizon line. Both are stylized. Atmospheric perspective is used. There is a heavy use of black line for contouring. Text and drawing are combined on the pages.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>manual </strong>for royal conduct of Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire (like Machiavelli’s The Prince). It is a  sign of Mongol leaders’ worldliness and sophistication. The <strong>cross-cultural influences</strong> show acceptance, interest in trade and diffusion.</p>
<p>It is a work <strong>propaganda</strong> that links the Mongols to the great lineage of Persian rulers. Since this is a Shahnama that the Mongols commissioned, it illustrates that the Mongols are trying to liken themselves to the Persian rulers in this text by showing it is of interest to them. Mongols were foreign rulers, so this was especially important.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of this book were made. It is assumed that it was commissioned by a high-ranking member of the Ilkhanid court</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shahnama (Book of Kings)</strong> is a compilation of stories about Persian/Iranian rulers, originally from 1010. It tells the stories of ancient heroes and kings Pre-Islamic Iran. It is based on truth but aggrandized and some parts are fictional and sensationalized. Full of adventure, romance, and a guide to ethics, the  good kings are lauded.</p>
<p>One of the kings in the text is Bahram Gur. As Sassanian King from 430-438 CE. He wears a robe of European fabric to slay a fearsome horned wolf (the Karg). The setting shows influence from Chinese landscapes</p>
<h5><strong>Importance of Illustrated Books</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Illustrated books</strong> were a very important art form in Iran. It flourished  during a cultural Golden Age led by the Mongols in the Ilkhanid Empire. This was the Mongol Empire in the Middle East.  Manuscript illumination was highly prized by Mongols.</p>
<p>The Mongols ruled as foreigners in a conquered land. They employed words and images to legitimize their rule and by linking themselves with great native Persian rulers of the past?</p>
<h5><strong>Diversity of Court</strong></h5>
<p>Mongol court was very diverse and cross-cultural, and this influence ended up in artwork. much of this diversity and cross-cultural influence ended up in the artwork. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persian story of Shahnama</li>
<li>Mongol patron in the Middle East</li>
<li>European realism / fabric / sense of space with low horizon line</li>
<li>Chinese landscape (trees, foliage) / calligraphic black line &amp; knowledge of paper</li>
<li>Persian technique of vibrant watercolors</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Jahangir</strong></em><em><strong> Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</strong></em><strong> </strong>is also known as <em><strong>Jahangir</strong></em><em><strong> Enthroned on an Hourglass</strong></em>. This <strong>work on paper, by artist Bichitr</strong>,  is comprised of <strong>watercolor, gold and ink</strong> and measures <strong>10 inches tall.</strong></p>
<p>It is one of the <strong>symbolic paintings</strong> of Jahangir&#8217;s reign, eulogizing the power status of the contemporary dynasty. One of the many novel expression methods, the symbolism is distinctly handled.</p>
<p>To view you must concentrate on the <strong>aesthetics of composition</strong>, <strong>color palette</strong>, and a manipulative variation of <strong>figural sizes</strong>.</p>
<p>Bichitra, the painter, depicted various <strong>vegetal forms</strong> along with the <strong>calligraphic</strong> verses on the border. This trademark work combining many regional influences, illustrates Bichitra’s use of <strong>cross-cultural motifs</strong> to convey Mughal principles. Jahangir accepted European entry into the Indian subcontinent, which brought in <strong>western motifs in Indian art</strong>. This included Mughal miniatures are a part of larger books.</p>
<p>The thick and colorful <strong>floral border</strong> on the painting defines the Jahangir-era of Mughal art. The folio, as part of Muraqqa, establishes the spiritual trait of Jahangir’s personality by portraying the Sufi Sheikh as a prior figure after himself.</p>
<h5><strong>The Main Characters</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?resize=592%2C487&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="592" height="487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208-B.jpg?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>The painting comprises five human figures of a reputed status, in decreasing order of visual size. The largest figure is that of <strong>King Jahangir</strong>, while the man in front of him is <strong>Sufi Sheikh Hussain</strong>, in a dimension little shorter than him. The king is adorned with jewelry as opposed to pale garb of the sheikh.</p>
<p>King Jahangir is handing over a book to the Sufi Sheikh Hussain, which he accepts in a shawl, avoiding the physical contact, as an imperial protocol.</p>

<p><strong>Ottoman sultan, King James I and the artist make a cameo.</strong></p>
<p>The figure below the spiritual leader is an <strong>Ottoman sultan</strong>, followed by <strong>English King James I</strong>. Ottoman sultan&#8217;s turban-tied headdress distinguishes him as a foreigner to the Mughal court, while he awaits his chance to greet Jahangir. King James I, in his royal attire, gazes out of the painting, which is a typical style of European art.</p>
<p>The last figure is that of <strong>the artist</strong> himself, <strong>Bichitra</strong>. Despite the significance over the form of the King’s figure, the ochre-chrome yellow garb of Bichitra grabs the attention compulsively. However, the attire&#8217;s fashion indicates that he was a Hindu artist in the Mughal court. He is holding a miniature painting, which suggests his profession.</p>
<h5><strong>Adaptations of European Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from these, the other flying semi-human forms are <strong>putti figures</strong>, which are European-influenced characters.</p>
<p><strong>The halo</strong> behind the Jahangir’s head, and <strong>hourglass</strong>, are further adaptations of European forms. Concentric in kind, glaring flames around the head seemingly recognize his sun-like illuminated and authoritative demeanor.</p>
<p>At the same time, the crescent moon at the lower arc of the halo is a prevalent representation of spiritual enlightenment in Jain paintings. Symbolically, the crescent moon also narrates the endless cycle of day and night.</p>
<p><strong>King Jahangir</strong> is seated on a large and ornate <strong>hourglass</strong>. On the putti on the hourglass are engraving with an inscription that reads, “Allah is great. O Shah may the span of your reign be a thousand years”.</p>
<p>The hourglass is an emblematic attribute of the beginning of the new Islamic millennium, it begins with the rule of a knowledgeable Mughal ruler.</p>
<p>From these forms we can infer that Bichitra had been studying European artworks that were accepted by the king as gifts.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism</strong></h5>
<p>While figures are naturalistic and convincingly real, space itself is tipped <strong>upwards and flattened</strong>. A few areas are painted in gradual tonal values, while the rest is in flat application of colors. Artist has utilized a <strong>colorful palette</strong> with incredibly precise and intricate detailing. Notably, the division of backdrop helps in acquiring a rhythmic gaze over the work.</p>
<p>An ornate lower half, which apparently is a Persianate carpet, is replete with <strong>abstract, repetitive, and naturalistic design.</strong> In addition, the artist has neglected linear perspective to feature the content significantly.</p>

<figure id="attachment_844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-844" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-844" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=500%2C729&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="729" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-844" class="wp-caption-text">Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings<br />© Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The painting is enclosed in a <strong>group of rectangular frames</strong> that show a varying <strong>floral and calligraphic designs</strong>. Bordering with repetitive and small decorative cartouches, the background of the folio has floral arabesque. These <strong>floral motifs</strong> are inspired by the local flowers of the region.</p>
<p>At the cusp of the painting, on the vertical edges, the band depicts a calligraphic verse praising the king. The lower band expresses, “Though outwardly Shahs stand before him, he fixes his gaze on dervishes.”</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Mughal miniatures</strong> were often a part of a more comprehensive book project called <strong>Muraqqa</strong>. Murraqas describes lives of Mughal kings or elites. They were accessible to the selected and not common men. After the volume was written, it would be given to an artist with secluded pages to illustrate the relevant narratives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this folio was to render a spiritual and wise image of noble Mughal King Jahangir. As he preferred a spiritual Sufi Sheikh over the kings of the world, he is indicated to be a grand sovereign of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Mughal paintings are said to have used <strong>gold, silver, and lapiz lazuli</strong>, among other hues, for rendition. The usage of material depended on the project and the role it played over the larger mass. The <strong>colors</strong> were generally obtained from <strong>local natural resources</strong>. For example, white was made by grinding the conch, while black from the lamp residue.</p>
<p>In addition, Mughal kings followed greater political propaganda to disperse the might of the Mughal ruler. It also displayed Jahangir’s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety’s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.</p>
<h5><strong>Traditions</strong></h5>
<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance</strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.</p>
<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him</strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp’s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous <em>Hamzanama</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hamzanama </em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers</strong>.</p>
<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir’s court painters</p>
<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons</strong></h5>
<p>Bichitra (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to <em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em> under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases. <em>Baburnama</em>, <em>Akbarnama</em>, <em>Tujuk-I- </em><em>Jahangir</em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing ateliers</strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.</p>
<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.</strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved</strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette</strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts</strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.</p>
<p>During Akbar’s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bichitra</strong> was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir’s reign.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Palazzo Torlonia, Rome</p>
<p>This work, approximately <strong>14 inches high</strong>, is crafted from <strong>marble</strong> and <strong>polychromed</strong> or painted in several different colors. This is a <strong>p</strong><strong>ortrait</strong> in <strong>bust </strong>form from the shoulders up.</p>
<p>The function was to depict a person accurately. The <strong>veristic </strong>style is one that is highly realistic and often exaggerated. The old man looks old indeed. Yet in Roman times age meant wisdom, experience, and respect. This face of a Roman <strong>patrician </strong>aristocrat, nobleman or senator, is also toothless, with a sagging jawline. The name of the individual is unknown.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons of Roman Art</strong></h5>
<p>Patrons of Roman art were almost all men from old and distinguished families.  They were fiercely proud of their lineage and wanted to preserve likenesses of themselves and ancestors. <strong>Roman Republic art</strong> was not interested in idealization and perfection in form but interested in work ethic and civic service.</p>

<p>This <strong>mosaic</strong> made from over a million and a half tiny pieces of glass and stone, known as <strong>tesserae</strong> . The work measures <strong>8 feet by 11 inches and 16 feet by 9 inches</strong>, shows a naturalistic style. It exhibits radical <strong>foreshortening</strong>, or extension perpendicular to the picture plane, into the deep, painted space. Figures are not stacked but turned into picture plane.   The <strong>tesserae</strong> show <strong>modeling</strong>, or use of light and dark to create shadow, which conveys a roundness of form.</p>
<h5><strong>Made for Home</strong></h5>
<p>The work was found between two courtyards in the most extravagant mansion, called <strong>House of Faun, in Pompei</strong>. It was preserved in the ash of the Eruption of Mount Vesuvious.</p>
<p>This floor was the first thing a visitor would see upon entering the foyer of the home.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting the Scene</strong></h5>
<p>In the <strong>Alexander Mosaic</strong> a fearful Darius on the left has just told his soldiers to flee. He has spun his chariot around, while his soldiers have yet to lower their spears to the Greeks. Many Persians are wounded.</p>
<p>One on the ground sees his own reflection in his armour before he starts to die.</p>

<p>On the right Alexander remains triumphant. In his time, the great leader managed not only to unify Greece, but also moved into parts of Egypt, east into Persia and into Induus Valley.</p>
<h5><strong>Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>It depicts the battle between the Greeks and Alexander the Great and the Persians and Darius III. Literature from the time claims the work is a replica of a Greek painting, yet paintings from this time have never been found.</p>
<p>It displays the Romans love for Greek works, but also an interest in Alexander. Although he died at the age of 32, he was considered a great leader.</p>
<h4><strong>The Early Empire<br />

<p><strong>The House of Vettii </strong>was one of the most luxurious private homes, or Roman townhouse known as <strong>domus, in Pompeii, Italy. </strong>The <strong>1, 1000 square meter</strong>,<strong> stone cut </strong>home was named for its owners, two successful brothers, who were former slaves and now freedmen, Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus. The were newly rich, gathering riches as merchants and wanted a way to display their wealth.</p>

<p>Most of Pompeii had private homes with few exterior windows and one entrance from the street. At the House of Vettii the entrance is through a <strong>foyer</strong> into an <strong>atrium, or open air courtyard </strong>with an<strong> impluvium, </strong>or sunken space to catch the rainwater<strong>.   Cubiculas, </strong>or private bedrooms surrounded the atrium.  Typically, homes had a second <strong>atrium</strong> which was surrounded by a <strong>peristyle</strong> or rectangle of columns.

<p>Pompeiian <strong>wall frescoes</strong> are preserved which has allowed historians to study them.</p>
<p>Historians found there were four styles:</p>
<p>The <strong>First Style</strong> was faux marble blocks.</p>

<p>The <strong>Second Style</strong> was naturalistic scenes, as though looking through a window.</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Fourth Style</strong> was a <strong>combination of all three, often with scenes of mythological images. </strong>The House of Vettii has excellent examples of the Fourth Style.</p>

<p>Techniques to illustrate depth include highlights and modeling, overlapping figures, one point perspective, and atmospheric perspective.</p>
<p>In the Fourth Style <strong>wall fresco in the Pentheus Room, </strong>the scene on the left is <em><strong>Young Hercules Strangling the Snakes.</strong></em> The scene on the right shows the  Pentheus being torn to pieces by the Cult of Bacchus. Pentheus opposed the cult of Bacchus.</p>

<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Roman architect Vitruvius wrote <em>De Architectura (On Architecture) in 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE. </em>He mentioned Etruscan Temple of Minerva. He also outlined the key elements and proportions of a Roman home.</p>
<p>The House of Vettii was based on an ideal Pompeian house from Vitruvius’s <i>De </i><i>Architectura </i><i>(On Architecture).</i></p>
<p>(1) Foyer</p>
<p>(2) Atrium</p>
<p>(3) Impluvium</p>

<p>The home was discovered in the 18<sup>th</sup> century during archaeological excavations that unearthed Pompeii. The city had been buried in volcanic ash  Pompeii with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>In Detail</strong></h5>
<p>Based closely on Doryphoros by Polykleitos, the sculpture stands in <strong>contrapposto. </strong>The relaxed stance of the Primaporta statue also gives it the look of being real and portraying action.</p>
<p>His breast plate, or <strong>cuirass</strong>, is a detailed canvass for the story he wanted to tell. In pictures it depicts battles he won. Sol and Caelus, the sun god and sky god appear.  There are female figures that represent countries he conquered. Apollo, Diana, and the earth god Tellus also are present.</p>

<p>At his feet is Cupid riding a dolphin. Cupid is the son of Venus and this inclusion hinted at that Augustus was descended from the gods. (In fact, it was declared true the day he died!) The dolphin was the symbol of his navel victory at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. Here he overtook Antony and Cleopatra, becoming the sole ruler of the empire.</p>
<h5><strong>Political Propaganda</strong></h5>
<p>The message was clear. Good would come to the Romans. All thanks to Augustus.</p>
<p>Caesar Augustus was the founder of the Roman Empire and the first Emperor of Rome. He was an ambitious man. In his book he wrote:</p>
<p><em>“In my nineteenth year, on my own initiative and at my own expense, I raised an army with which I set free the state, which was oppressed by the domination of a faction.” </em></p>
<p>Augustus was less than 19 when he inherited Julius Caesar’s empire</p>
<p>The work is a piece of political propaganda. Found at Livia’s home, Villa of Livia, in Prima Porta, Rome, this is where senators and generals were invited.</p>

<p>The Colosseum (a nickname for the Flavian Amphitheatre) is a work in <strong>stone and concrete</strong> that took 10 years to build. It could accommodate up to 50,000 people and measures <strong>615 feet  long by 510 feet wide.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>What is the Difference Between a Theater and an Amphitheater?</strong></h5>
<p>A theatre is half a circle, while an amphitheatre is a full circle.</p>
<h5><strong>The Details</strong></h5>
<p>Above each ground floor arch is a carved number in Roman numerals: this indicated the seating section for spectators. There were 76 entrances or <strong>vomitoria</strong> that encircled the bottom.</p>
<p>The seating was determined by status. The emperor had his own private box.  On the first level sat senators, magistrates, vestal virgins and wealthy women. The second level was reserved for knights and generals. The third and fourth level were for the middle class. The fifth level held women and the poor.</p>
<h5><strong>A Concrete Construction</strong></h5>
<p>Built with concrete technology, this led to new shapes, such as curved walls. The concrete was made with lime mortar, volcanic sand, and water that was mixed together. It was then placed in wooden frames to dry.</p>
<p>To make sure concrete pieces stay firmly attached to one another, instead of using mortar, Romans used lead and bronze pins, like a skeleton that held multiple blocks together. Concrete formed the core but the outside was covered with travertine.</p>
<p>Romans believed that concrete was effective and practical but ugly. Concrete was cheaper than importing tufa or Greek marble. Also general labourers, or in this case Roman slaves could work in the construction and not specialists.</p>
<h5><strong>Arches</strong></h5>
<p>The Romans were masters at building arches and the Colessum masters the arch. The arches were built with a wooden frames underneath that could be removed. Each stone has to be wedge-shaped or smaller at bottom than on top. If this was achieved correctly, mortar was not needed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-364" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?resize=500%2C378&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="378" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?w=845&amp;ssl=1 845w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?resize=768%2C581&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A<strong> voussoir</strong> is individual stones of an arch. A <strong>keystone </strong>is the topmost, central stone in an arch. Arches can be extended or stretched horizontally into <strong>barrel vaults</strong>. This building shows three circular <strong>barrel vaults</strong> that are layered upon one another.  Two-barrel vaults that intersect are called <strong>groin vaults. </strong>An arch rotated in space is called a <strong>dome.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>The Columns</strong></h5>
<p>The façade has <strong>engaged columns</strong>, columns that are rounded but attached to a building on the back side. First story is Tuscan or Doric with a base. The second story is Ionic. The third story is Corinthian. Each order or section is lighter, more decorative and complex than the order</p>
<h5><strong>A Moving Floor and Ceiling</strong></h5>
<p>The floor was built with trap doors, and completely covered with sand so that it was pitch black underneath. There were working elevators that were pulled up by rope, to bring props, animals and people up to the stage.</p>
<p>A velarium or shade, in the form of a retractable roof, was pulled to cover the wide opening at the top of the building.</p>

<p>In the morning, the audience could watch <strong>animal hunts</strong>. Exotic animals were brought in for these events. There were wolves from Italy, giraffes from Africa, bears from Germany and crocodiles from the Nile. These animals were kept in the dark depths of the building<strong>, </strong>starving for days to encourage aggression.</p>
<p>At lunch time, <strong>prisoners were executed</strong>. In the afternoon, <strong>Gladiators</strong>, competed to the death. There were sometimes up to 100 games per day.</p>
<p><strong>Large theatrical events</strong> also took place a naval battle was recreated with 3,000 participants and the flooding of the Colosseum.</p>

<h5><strong>In Context</strong></h5>
<p>The building was named <strong>Flavian Amphitheater</strong> after the new ruling family the Flavians. They followed the Julio-Claudians, who ended when Nero committed suicide. Nero was the last Julio-Claudian, His reign was marked by extravagance, corruption, and brutality. He burned Christians and killed his mother and wife, before killing himself.</p>
<p>First Flavian ruler was Vespasian. He chose to claim back public land, in which Nero had taken from the people and built a private palace park, with an artificial lake. Here he built<strong> Flavian Amphitheater (Colesseum)</strong> This he used to entertain the masses.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Crusaders caused damage to the <strong>Colosseum</strong>, by removing lead and bronze pins for their weaponry. To find these pins, they had to dig holes in the Colosseum.</p>

Architecture</p>
<p><strong>Petra</strong> is famous for its <strong>rock cut tombs</strong> built in what today is <strong>Jordan</strong>.  Here there are <strong>800 tombs</strong>, and <strong>3000 architectural elements</strong> carved from <strong>sandstone and limestone</strong>. Located in a rocky basin, Petra is accessed by a deep road called Siq. Geographically, the site is located 150 miles south of both Amman, the capital of Jordan and Jerusalem.</p>
<h5><strong>Background History</strong></h5>
<p>The Nabatean people had settled in southern Jordan by 312 BCE.  Ideally placed at the Northern end of the Caravan Route that ran from South Arabia to the Mediterranean, the people were great traders during the late Hellenistic and Early Roman Periods. The commerce of luxury products such as frankincense and myrrh, that was burned at alters, as well as spice, contributed to a wealthy society.</p>
<p>The <strong>Romans </strong>invaded during 106 CE and changed the name to Arabia Petrae. Here, they ruled for 250 years, until an earthquake destroyed the buildings. The <strong>Byzantines </strong>would take control later and govern for another 300 years. Petra was mostly abandoned however, by the eight century CE.</p>
<p>Referred to as the Rose City, because of the color the stone appears, Petra was named a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong>, in 1985.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Initially, historians thought Petra was a large necropolis or cemetery. The architecture proves otherwise, uncovering what was once an active and well-developed metropolis.</p>
<p>With talented architects the community transformed the rocky desert into a great city through innovative constructions. Engineers turned the dusty land into a garden oasis by using an elaborate water system through damming, terracing, and irrigation. This was used to harvest, store and distribute water collected during the rainy season.</p>
<h5><strong>The Treasury Façade</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-380" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-380" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Petra-Tresaury-1.jpg?resize=500%2C601&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="601" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-380" class="wp-caption-text">Treasury<br />© Bernard Gagnon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most famous building is the Treasury (or Khazneh). It measures 249 meters wide by 38.77 meters high.</p>
<p>The façade contains both Hellenistic, and Near Eastern architecture. As the city grew it was influenced by trade and culture of Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines.</p>
<p>Architectural features include broken <strong>pediment </strong>with two <strong>obelisks</strong> above reaching into the rocks. There are ornate <strong>Corinthian columns</strong> throughout. There is also a circular building at the top called a <strong>tholos</strong>.</p>
<p>Sculptural works on the lower level include the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, known to protect both travelers and the dead.  The upper levels house Amazons and Victories around an unidentified female goddess.</p>
<p>Other symbols include eagles, vines, vegetation, and vases with large handles, known as <strong>kantharoi</strong>. The rosettes are associated with the Ancient Near East.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: The Treasury at Petra appeared in the movie <strong>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</strong><em>.</em></p>

<p>The Great Temple at Petra is <strong>the largest freestanding building</strong> that has been excavated at the site. The temple precinct has a formal entry or Propylaeum, a Lower Temenos, or sacred enclosure. To access the Upper Temenos, there are two sets of stairs. These are located both east and west.</p>
<p>The temple continued to thrive well into the Roman period. It stopped being used following the devastating earthquake that struck Petra in 363 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>The Painted Biclinium</strong></h5>
<p>This monument is named for the benches that are carved out along two walls. The painting on the ceiling of the alcove, a rare glimpse of this medium in Nabatean culture, is an intricate creation of grapevines, flowers, birds, and cherubs. The interior also has drawings of Roman gods, including the son of Venus, Cupid.</p>

<p><strong>Forum of Trajan </strong>is made of<strong> concrete and brick. </strong>It measures<strong> 980 feet by 607 feet. </strong>Trajan was a great military general who expanded the Roman Empire to its largest borders. Like Julius Caesar he wanted to have his own forum. Yet, there was no space available in Rome at the time.</p>
<p>Trajan asked his best architect <strong>Apollodorus of Damascus</strong> to remove a hill in the city and build the Forum of Trajan.</p>
<p>The Romans did not particularly like <strong>concrete</strong>, but it was cheap, and they always covered it with marble or <strong>brick</strong> as with the <strong>Forum of Trajan</strong>. Concrete also let the Romans build in new ways that were not limited to <strong>post-and-lintel</strong> construction<strong>. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>A Public Space Of Power</strong></h5>
<p>The Forum of Trajan was a civic space, a  hub that became an administrative, commercial, and political center.  It commemorated the Romans’ victory over the Dacians.</p>
<p>Trajan’s Forum was the size of all other imperial forums put together. Here, the military general was able to show his power, prestige, merit, and virtue.</p>

<h5><strong>A Quick Tour of the Forum</strong></h5>
<p>At the entryway there is an over-life size gilded bronze statue of  the emperor. The Basilica Ulpia  is complete with apses, and libraries filled with Greek and Roman literature. Additionally, there is the Column of Trajan and the Temple of Trajan.</p>
<h5><strong>Basilica Ulpia</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-290" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Basilica-Ulpia.jpg?resize=700%2C497&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="497" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The word <strong>Ulpia</strong> comes from Trajan’s family name.</p>
<p><strong>Basilica Ulpia</strong> was a law court and largest basilica in Rome.  The <strong>apse </strong>was where judges sat, illuminated by clerestory windows. The ceilings were <strong>coffered</strong>, a technique allowing spaces of the concrete carved to lighten the weight.</p>
<p>The basilica was decorated with niches, carvings, relief sculptures and free-standing sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>Basilica Ulpia </strong>is considered the most important architectural design in Rome. The architect took the design of the Greek Parthenon, hollowed it out and added apses.  The building shape and design came to signify authority.</p>
<p>The basilica can accommodate large numbers of people. There is one single entrance and exit  to control the flow of people and one single vantage point upon entering.</p>

<p>This was a two-story market with 150 shops and offices. The shops, or <strong>taberna</strong>, varied in size and were rented to shopkeepers. Each shop had a small store-front and storage rooms in the back. These were part of a semi-circular building, with <strong>clerestory</strong> windows or windows along the roofline. It was built using <strong>groin vault</strong> construction.</p>
<h5><strong>Column of Trajan</strong></h5>

<p>The grounds were made up of 125 feet high Roman Doric columns.  Each were 12 feet in diameter and made up 114 individual themes.</p>
<p><strong>Column of Trajan</strong> is made of stone from Luna, Italy. Eight solid <strong>marble </strong>pieces were quarried for the base, with 20 pieces 10 feet in diameter for the column. Each piece is individually carved to create a continuous spiral frieze.  The composition is crowded with 2500 low relief figures. The work shows the Romans at battle, winning with superior military skills.</p>
<p>This was originally commissioned to be a lookout tower and later was converted to a war memorial.  It commemorated Trajan’s campaigns against the Dacians of modern-day Romania. Trajan’s ashes are now located in the base.</p>
<p>The column could be entered, and once inside a spiral staircase led to a viewing platform</p>

<p>The <strong>Pantheon in Rome, Italy,</strong> is an impressive structure measuring  <strong>142 feet high by 142 feet wide.</strong></p>
<p>Originally set in a rectangular courtyard, the <strong>concrete with stone facing</strong> structure was framed by a colonnade. Only the front of the building would have been visible, with its impressive columns. These massive columns are made from <strong>marble</strong> imported from Egypt and form one piece. At the top are gigantic fragments that were once made of marble Corinthian capitals.</p>
<h5><strong>Architectural Features</strong></h5>
<p>The structure of the entire building relies on something the Romans were masters of. That is <strong>concrete</strong>. Here thick barrels of concrete are used. The walls are concrete mixed with basalt, a hard stone. These walls are 20 feet thick at the base. The dome or <strong>cupola</strong> was concrete with pumice for a lighter ceiling. A <strong>coffered</strong> ceiling helps to make the dome lighter.</p>
<p>The building interior is a <strong>radial</strong> style. This means the focus is on a central point which radiates out. A shape of a sphere would fill the interior. In fact, the interior is comprised with an obsession toward perfect geometry like circles, rectangles, and squares.  Decorative marble, imported from the far reaches of the Roman Empire adds colour in purple, orange, and blue.</p>

<p>There is an <strong>oculus</strong>, or circle cut into the ceiling that measures 27 feet across. This acts like a sundial. As the sun shines in it illuminates various parts of the building. The window does not contain glass, so when it rains, the floor gets wet.</p>

<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>The first monument on the site, was built by Marcus Agrippa to show Rome’s power over Antony and Cleopatra. After a fire, it was destroyed.  Then, the pantheon was built for Roman emperor Hadrian. Some say, it was a copy of the original. Others say the second building was not built by Hadrian, but that he inherited the construction near the end and took credit.</p>
<p>What started out as a temple of the gods, held statures of gods, goddesses, and emperors. Later it was turned into a church. Today it is a popular tourist attraction.</p>
<p>This it is one of the most copied architecture ever created. It is also one of the best preserved ancient Roman Monuments.</p>
<h5><strong>A New Theory </strong></h5>
<p>Today, historians think that Hadrian might have not used the Pantheon as temple , but rather a kind of monument to Roman emperors and political power. Many think it was his statement of humility to previous emperors.</p>
<h4><strong> </strong><strong>Theme for Late Roman/Early Christian Art: “Transformed”</strong></h4>
<p>This theme is used to describe the ways<strong> Greco-Roman architectural and iconographic</strong> forms were “transformed” <strong>by Christians</strong>.  Christians used these forms to facilitate their new view of the world and the new requirements of their worship.</p>
<h4><strong>Late Empire (192-306 CE)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Cultural influences bring about changes in Roman art and architecture in the Late Empire period.</li>
<li>The dissolution and chaos of the Roman Empire is mirrored in the abandonment of the classical tradition, previously embraced by Roman emperors.</li>
<li>Power, order, idealization, and individuality are lost in the art of the Late Empire.</li>
<li>Crowded tightly together; pushed forward on picture plane; depth and recession rejected.</li>
<li>Contrapposto ignored.</li>
<li>Emperors are increasingly shown as military figures rather than civilian rulers.</li>
<li>At the end of the 2nd century CE the power of Rome was beginning to decline.</li>
<li>The Soldier Emperors (235-284 CE)</li>
<li>Diocletian and the Tetrarchy (284-306 CE)</li>
<li>Constantine (306-337 CE) and conversion to Christianity</li>

<p>This <strong>marble</strong> sarcophagus is a highly intricate work carved in <strong>deep relief</strong>, using a hand drill. The work stands <strong>5 feet tall</strong>. This <strong>sarcophagus</strong> was discovered in 1621 <strong>in a tomb near the Porta Tiburtina, in Rome</strong>, and purchased by Cardinal Ludovisi, hence the name.</p>
<p>The Romans are depicted in classic style, with attractive features, while the Barbarians appear gargoyle like.  The work itself is not classical, but highly chaotic. People, armour, and horses are piled deeply on top of one another. There is not a single clean space. The images at the bottom are smaller as if crushed down by the weight of the others.</p>
<p>The hero is in the center with arms outreached welcoming victory.</p>
<p>It is unclear who was buried in this sarcophagus. Judging by the amount of work it would have taken for the artist to create the work, historians assume the diseased was a member of the elite classes.</p>
<p>Christians were still being persecuted in the Roman Empire. They were not accepted until the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE. Constantine’s Edict of Milan is when Christianity was officially a tolerated religion.</p>
<p>Burials occurred in underground chambers called <strong>catacombs. </strong>Openings called <strong>loculi</strong> were cut into walls to hold the dead and to hold <strong>sarcophagi</strong>.</p>
<p>Christians found cremation repugnant and preferred burials. They felt they needed their bodies during the end times, when Christ would raise the good and the dead to fight the devil.</p>
<p>Many wealthy Romans began to adopt the practice of saving the body rather than using cremation.</p>

<h4><strong>Late Empire (Christian) : 306 CE – 476 CE</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">7 BCE – 2 BCE (?): Jesus was born in Judea and becomes Jewish rabbi in Galilee; 30 CE – 33 CE (?): Jesus crucified.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Christianity spreads extremely quickly, despite being prohibited; this necessitated practice of Christianity “underground”.</li>
<li>313 CE: Edict of Milan with Emperor Constantine</li>
<li>Christianity officially recognized as a tolerated religion (marks a political separation from Judaism)</li>
<li>Difficulties still existed and most early Popes were martyred.</li>
<li>Christians were persecuted and this necessitated worship underground.</li>
<li>Earliest works are catacombs and sarcophagi.</li>
<li>Artists who took Christian commissions had to be careful to avoid persecution,</li>
<li>Christians were low-class and typically poor, so there were no large commissions.</li>
<li>This changed after Edict of Milan.</li>
<li>Christianity adapted imagery and architectural forms from Greco-Roman cults.</li>
<li>Dominance over pagan forms of worship</li>
<li>Appropriate early symbols to utilize for Christian God.</li>

<li>Large scale works avoided.</li>
<li>A desire to not look pagan.</li>

<p>The Catacombs of Priscilla, <strong>just north of Rome, Italy</strong>, occupies <strong>over five miles of underground burials</strong> that are three stories deep. Over 40,000 tombs were discovered inside.  It is <strong>made from natural quarries of tufa</strong>, a stone that is soft and easy to carve.</p>
<p>Inside are <strong>frescos</strong>, which shows a Roman influence with sketchy painterly brushstrokes that evoke Pompeiian painting. Yet, much of the work has been destroyed due to the humidity inside the catacombs.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Catacomb?</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>catacomb </strong>is an underground cemetery with subterranean pathways. Catacombs provided a place of early Christian worship during a time when they were prosecuted during the age of the Roman Empire. Catacombs are where some of the earliest Christians are buried, as well as the Beginning of creation of Christian iconography and Christian symbolism.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Greek Chapel</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Named for the two Greek inscriptions in the room, The Greek Chapel, is a <strong>cubicula </strong>or mortuary room and place for worship. It has three niches, called <strong>loculi</strong> for sarcophagi.  It is decorated in the style of the first Roman wall painting, imitating marble panels. The painted scenes referred to divine intervention and Christ’s miracles.</p>

<p>The <strong>Orant</strong> fresco or <strong><em>Cubiculum of the Veiled Woman</em></strong>, depicts one woman three times in a <strong>continuous narrative</strong> about the life of a Christian woman. On the left a bishop is officiating her marriage. On the right she is seated, nursing her newborn baby in a scene about motherhood. The large figure in the center is in <strong>orant</strong> or prayer pose. This symbolizes her blessed afterlife once she fulfills her familial obligations.</p>
<figure id="attachment_385" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-385" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-385" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/48-Good-Shepard-Fresco.jpg?resize=500%2C706&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="706" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/48-Good-Shepard-Fresco.jpg?w=233&amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/48-Good-Shepard-Fresco.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-385" class="wp-caption-text">Good Shepherd fresco<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the <strong>Good Shepherd frescoes</strong>, Christ is depicted as a shepherd<strong>. </strong>Prior to Constantine, Christ was often depicted this way, or as a young teacher. After the Edict of Milan, Christ is shown as a judge or king. This is because of the political and cultural changes regarding Christianity’s validity.</p>
<p>In the <strong>medallion</strong> or circle, the portrait of Christ as Good Shepherd, is a pastoral motif going back to the Greek Calf Bearer. The symbolism is that Christ will rescue individual sinners who stray from his flock, just like a shepherd does for sheep.  Notice the cross design of the ceiling, which is domed like the Dome of Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Priscilla?</strong></h5>
<p>These catacombs are built underneath a villa, once owned by a wealthy woman named Priscilla. This is how she decided to help sponsor the poor, as only the upper class could afford the cubicula and buy sarcophagi.</p>
<p>In 313 CE, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which not only forbid Christian persecution, but tolerated Christianity within the Roman empire. Until the sanction of the state, Christians remained hidden in small numbers. The religion attracted the poor, with a promise of a better afterlife. Since rich and poor were judged on equal terms Priscilla and other wealthy Christians, believe that the poor deserved a proper burial.</p>
<h5><strong>The First Examples of Christian Art</strong></h5>
<p>Why did Christianity exist for 200 years without artistic production? There are many theories. Some think that it may not have survived. Others think the 2<sup>nd</sup> commandment prohibited it.</p>
<p>Still another theory is that they did want their religion to be new, which focused on monotheism, not to replicate the Greco-Roman traditions that focused on polytheism and nudity.</p>

<p>The building for <strong>Santa Sabina</strong> was constructed by Peter of Illyria, in <strong>Rome, Italy.</strong> It is <strong>made of brick and stone, with a wooden roof</strong>.  The exterior is bare, simple, and unadorned.</p>
<figure id="attachment_397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-397" style="width: 313px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-397" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/49-Santa-Sabina-Floor-Plan.png?resize=313%2C460&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="313" height="460" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/49-Santa-Sabina-Floor-Plan.png?w=313&amp;ssl=1 313w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/49-Santa-Sabina-Floor-Plan.png?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-397" class="wp-caption-text">Santa Sabina plan</figcaption></figure>
<p>This Christian architecture was adapted from a Roman basilica. The building’s shape and design signified government authority, thanks to the Roman predecessors. The basilica’s association with law and justice pairs well with the Christian belief of the last judgement.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Interior Features</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_396" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-396" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-396" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/49-Santa-Sabina-Interior.jpg?resize=550%2C355&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="550" height="355" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/49-Santa-Sabina-Interior.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/49-Santa-Sabina-Interior.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-396" class="wp-caption-text">Santa Sabina<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Santa Sabina</strong> can accommodate a vast  number of people. It has one single entrance and exit point. The vantage point upon entering is the altar.</p>
<p>A dominant central axis leads from the entrance to the <strong>apse.</strong> Corinthian columns produce a steady rhythm along the <strong>arcade</strong> that draws all attention on the apse. <strong> </strong>The central space has a nave, flanked by side aisles, where you can see columns that line the nave.</p>
<p>A <strong>spolia</strong> is a repurposed architectural piece. In this case, it is the columns used from a pagan building and repurposed.</p>
<p>The <strong>clerestory,</strong> a row of windows along the top, emits light. These are not filled with stained glass but selenite, a colourless, transparent gypsum. The stained glass that is visible was added later. Light is a symbol of Christ, with an emphasis is on the spiritual, and intangible.</p>
<p>The interior ceiling is simple with a coffer technique to lighten the wood.</p>
<h5><strong>A Church Dedicated to Saint Sabina</strong></h5>
<p>This Roman Catholic church is dedicated to Saint Sabina. In 430, her relics were brought to Santa Sabina. The exterior is meant to display the grit and corruption of the human body. The interior is bright, glittering with mosaics, and light, as if it displays the human soul.</p>
<h5><strong>A Look at the Details</strong></h5>
<p>Inside this Basilica-plan church are <strong>spandrels</strong> or spaces between the tops of arches. This depicts chalices and bread plates. It references the Eucharist, a ceremony in the church when people take communion. Here bread and wine symbolize body and blood.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background of Christianity</strong></h5>
<p>Constantine legalized Christianity with the Edit of Milan in 313 CE. Christians can then worship in public spaces. Large numbers of people convert, as the religion grows.</p>

<h3><strong>Theme: “Life in Death”</strong></h3>
<p>Etruscan tombs provide much of what we know about the Etruscans. The theme focuses on the funerary nature of Etruscan artifacts, as well as on the vitality or liveliness inherent in many Etruscan figural works of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>10<sup>th</sup> BCE – 270 BCE</li>
<li>Italy before the Romans</li>
<li>Resided in the area between the Arno and Tiber rivers in fortified hilltop cities.</li>
<li>Etruscans never formed a unified kingdom.</li>
<li>The cities coexisted.</li>
<li>Skilled seafarers and traders</li>
<li>Greek influence on the Etruscans</li>
<li>Etruscan influence on the Romans in both architecture and sculpture</li>
<li>Etruscan women had a high standing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Sophisticated necropolis with tombs with large interior chambers decorated to look like the interior of a house.</li>
<li>Etruscans were heavily influenced by Archaic Greek art
<ul>
<li>Broad shoulders, stylization of hair, Archaic smile</li>
<li>Avoided nudity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excelled in terra-cotta, bronze, iron, copper, silver, and tin.</li>
<li>Temples were made of wood and terra-cotta, not stone.</li>
<li>Architectural elements included pediments, columns, and cellas.</li>
<li>Etruscan painting depicted the content of funerary celebrations, with brightly painted happy Etruscans drinking, eating, and celebrating.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong> </strong><strong>(2) 31. Temple of Minerva and sculpture of Apollo  </strong></h4>
<p>Temple of Minerva (elevation and plan). Master sculptor Vulca. Etruscan. 510-500 BCE. Etruscan.</p>
<figure id="attachment_296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-296" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-296" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Temple-of-Minerva-Plan.png?resize=500%2C597&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="597" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-296" class="wp-caption-text">Temple of Minerva plan</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>, in <strong>Veii, near Rome, Italy</strong>, was made from mudbrick and wood. Therefore, the structure has vanished.</p>
<p>We know what it would have looked like thanks to Roman architect Vitruvius who wrote the book <em>De architectura, </em>a book about Etruscan temples in the late first century BCE.</p>

<p>The temple measured <strong>50 by 70 feet</strong> and was elevated on a raised platform like a stylobate. The stone foundation was made from a material called <strong>tufa</strong>, a porous limestone made from volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Steps in front direct your attention to the porch, the only one defined entrance in the front. It was not meant to be seen from the back or sides.</p>

<p>The influence of Greek architecture is evident in the pediment/columns. These <strong>Tuscan columns</strong> are Doric with a base, unfluted, made from wood and spaced widely apart. Once these columns had been painted to be both colourful and ornate.</p>
<p><strong>Acroteria, or roof sculptures</strong> sat on the tops of Etruscan temples, unlike in Greek architecture, where these figures would be in the pediment.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dedication to Minerva</strong></h5>
<p>This temple was a dedication to Minerva (Athena) patron goddess of heroic endeavors. It was a place not only of worship, but community and gatherings.</p>
<p>The back portion of the building was divided into three separate rooms or <strong>triple cellas</strong>, known as a <strong>divine triad</strong>.  These were dedicated to Athena (Minerva), Zeus (Jupiter) and Hera (Juno)</p>

<p>Several terra cotta sculptures remain from the <strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>. The most prized is the <strong>Sculpture of Apollo </strong>standing at<strong> 5 feet 11 inches</strong>. This<strong> acroterion </strong>roof sculpture was painted. It has the<strong> Archaic smile</strong> that Etruscan figures tend to present as excitement and happiness. The hair is braided as is common. Apollo is stepping forward, but there is no movement in the upper body.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Vulca?</strong></h5>
<p>Etruscan art is almost always anonymous. However, literature gives us a clue as to who created the pieces found at the <strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>. Roman writer Pliny wrote that in the late 6th century BCE, an <strong>Etruscan artist by the name of Vulca</strong> was summoned from Veii to Rome, with a request to decorate the most important temple there, the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.</p>
<p>This was a large-scale commission that required the work of a master. Art historians believe that these skills may have landed Vulca the commission at Temple of Minerva.</p>
<p>Today the <strong>Sculpture of Apollo</strong> resides at the <strong>Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia</strong>, in Rome.</p>

<h4><strong>(</strong><strong>2) 29.Sarcophagus of the Spouses</strong></h4>

Funerary<br />
Status</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia, Rome</p>
<p>This masterwork is an anthropoid, or human-shaped <strong>painted terracotta</strong> <strong>sarcophagus found in the ancient Etruscan city of Caere, now Cerveteri, Italy</strong>.  It measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches</strong> in length.</p>
<h5><strong>Purpose for Creation</strong></h5>
<p>This was a sarcophagus for a married couple. The ashes were placed inside.  The size of the sarcophagus was a symbol of status.</p>
<h5><strong>Depiction and Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>In the <strong>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</strong> a couple reclines on a dining couch, eating and drinking. This was how funerals were ritualized in Etruscan society. A funeral banquet, including male and female guests, was the way of sending the deceased off to the afterlife.</p>
<p>Both the man and woman in the artwork hold objects that were related to a banquet.  A pomegranate was the symbol of eternal life or an egg, the symbol of regeneration.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Efforts</strong></h5>
<p>The detailed Caertan sarcophagus took a great deal of time to create. The rounded faces, have archaic smiles, and hairstyles that are Greek in nature. The angular composition of the bodies however was Etruscan. Looking closely, you will notice the soft cap on the woman’s head, along with the pointed shoes.</p>
<p>The great size meant that it needed to be fired multiple times. It was likely cut in half when it was beginning to dry and get leather hard.</p>
<h5><strong>Women in Society</strong></h5>
<p>This piece reflects the high standing of women in Etruscan society. Women were not allowed to dine with men in Ancient Greece.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>While the work would have originally included the cremated remains of the deceased, the remains of the individuals is unknown. Historians agree that it belonged to members of the elite.</p>
<h4><strong>(2) 32. Tomb of the Triclinium </strong></h4>
<p>480-470 BCE. Etruscan.</p>

<p>This Etruscan chamber tomb dates to 470 BCE and is in the necropolis of <strong>Tarquinia, Italy</strong> known in ancient times as <em>Tarquinii</em> or <em>Tarch(u)na</em>). The subterranean rock cut tomb, cut out of local <strong>tufa</strong> was made for both the deceased and grave goods.</p>
<p><strong>Tumulus</strong> were large burial mounds in Etruscan architecture that were part of a necropolis. These  sometimes reached colossal sizes of over 130 feet across.</p>

<h5><strong>The Fresco</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>fresco</strong> decorated wall has a focus on the banquet scene in the center. Figures are reclining on dining couches or klinai. The guests are dressed in colourful robes and being waited on by attendants. There are birds in the artwork and a cat. The left and right walls depict dancing and musicians.  The ceiling is also painted in a checkerboard pattern, depicting the tents that were temporarily erected for these events.</p>
<p>Note the skin colorations which were typical of the time in Etruscan art. The women have white skin, while the men have orange brown.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>The Etruscans did not leave written records, so most of our knowledge comes from tombs and depictions of their lives. Funerals were seen as a transition from one realm to the next.  These were not sorrowful affairs, but festive.</p>
<h5><strong>VOCABULARY</strong></h5>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>GREEK ART</strong></h2>
<h3>2500 &#8211; 80 BCE</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-283" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Plaque-of-the-Ergastines.jpg?resize=900%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="900" height="565" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Plaque-of-the-Ergastines.jpg?w=448&amp;ssl=1 448w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Plaque-of-the-Ergastines.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>THEME: ACH</strong></h4>
<p>ACH is the acronym for:</p>
<p><strong>ARCHAIC</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASSICAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>HELLENISTIC</strong></p>
<p>These are the later and most important three of the five styles, in chronological order throughout classical Greek art.</p>
<p><strong>Proto-Greek: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cycladic</strong> &#8211; Cycladic Islands, burial mounds, 2500 BCE</p>
<p><strong>Minoan</strong> &#8211; Island of Crete, Place of Knossos, 1500 BCE</p>
<p><strong>Mycenaean</strong> &#8211; mainland Greece, citadel at Mycenae, 1200 BCE</p>
<h5><strong>Periods of Greek Art:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Orientalizing </strong>&#8211; 700 BCE -influenced by styles of the East, which featured animals and people. This lasted for about 150 years, it inspired the Greeks to add motifs within their geometric patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Archaic</strong> &#8211; 600-500 BCE &#8211; Greek city states emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Early Classical (Severe)</strong> &#8211; 500-480 BCE &#8211; Greeks win second Persian War 480 BCE</p>
<p><strong>Classical</strong> &#8211; 480-404 BCE &#8211; Peloponnesian Wars end in 404 BCE</p>
<p><strong>Late Classical</strong> (4th Century) &#8211; 404-323 BCE &#8211; Alexander the Great dies in 323 BCE</p>
<p><strong>Hellenistic</strong> &#8211; 323-80 BCE &#8211; Romans make Greece a colony century. 80 BCE.</p>
<p>The art of <strong>Ancient Greece and Rome is grounded in civic ideals </strong>and<strong> polytheism</strong>. Etruscan and Roman artists and architects accumulated and <strong>adapted Greek objects and forms </strong>to create buildings and artworks that appealed to their tastes for eclecticism and historicism (social and cultural phenomena determined by history).</p>
<p>Archaeological models and <strong>artworks are identified by periods based on stylistic changes</strong> and assigned to periods according to styles (archaic, Classical, Hellenistic). <strong>Art considered Ancient Greek is not defined</strong> <strong>by politics, governments, or dynasties</strong>. Artists were influenced by earlier Mediterranean cultures.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek architecture and figural representations are<strong> characterized by ideal proportions and spatial relationships</strong>, expressing the <strong>society’s values of harmony and balance</strong>. Their art provides the foundation for the later development of European and Mediterranean artistic traditions.</p>
<p>From the 18th century on, Europe and America admired Ancient Greek ethical and governmental systems: art and architecture that could be associated with political elites and cultural capitals. The Greek culture had a <strong>tradition of epic storytelling that glorified the exploits of gods, goddesses, and heroes</strong>. They had a highly developed rhetorical tradition that prized public oratory and poetry.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>After the collapse of Mycenean Society in 1100 BCE, a major community did not rise together again until Greek city-state in 900 BCE. Although politically separated, they were united in language and culture.</p>
<p>By the 6<sup>th</sup> century BCE, Athens began to assume a cultural and commercial presence.</p>
<p>The Greeks united to defeat Persia at the Persian War (499- 449 BCE)</p>
<p>In 359 BCE Greece is overtaken by the Macedonian Kingdom.  Later Alexander the Great led a united Greece against Persia.</p>
<p>MAP</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>Artists started to sign their names to their works, in an act of both pride and to advertise.</p>
<p>“X made it.”</p>
<p>“X decorated it.”</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Styles                            </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Archaic (600 -448 BCE)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Classical (480-320 BCE)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hellenistic (320-30 BCE)</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Greek Pottery</strong></h5>
<p>Some vessels were created for everyday use. Others were for tombs and monuments. Almost all were designed for a purpose.</p>

<p>Notice how each part of the pottery work is named after a human body part.</p>
<h5><strong>Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>Greek sculpture was a way of idealizing the human form. <strong>Contrapposto</strong> replaced the mobile look of Egyptian art. It evoked a range of emotions.</p>
<p>The work was created in <strong>bronze or marble</strong>. The marble works were cut away from the stone behind.</p>
<p>An interest in nudity was prevalent in Greek art. Egyptian art only portrayed children naked. Mesopotamians considered this an act of debasing.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Ancient Greek architecture has proven to be enduring. Today, throughout the Unites States, you will see buildings that are based on Greek works, such as a city hall, theatre, bank, or library. One of the main things that draws the eye to these classical styles are columns. These includes <strong>Doric, Iconic and Corinthian columns.</strong></p>
<p>All three varieties or <strong>orders</strong>, share the same fluted column or <strong>drum</strong>. The top is called the <strong>capital. </strong> This is where each column is different. <strong>Doric</strong> is the simplest variety with a tapered disc supporting a square top. <strong>Iconic</strong> has curls on the top. <strong>Corinthian</strong> is a fancy filigree that looks like a symmetrical plant trying to grow. This varies and takes on many ornate forms.</p>
<p>A <strong>basic Greek temple</strong> is a rectangular shaped building with a long, angled roof.  This peaks to form a triangle called a <strong>pediment.</strong> These areas were adorned with life sized sculptures.</p>
<p>The roof rests upon an even plane called an <strong>entablature</strong>. This spanned the gaps between columns and  provided a solid surface. As temple buildings became more advanced, the entablature was decorated with what was called <strong>metopes.</strong> These were separated by three lines called <strong>triglyphs.</strong></p>
<p>Later still, as temples became bigger, a second row of columns was added and decorated along the top in what is called <strong>frieze</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>ARCHAIC PERIOD: 600- 400 BCE</strong></h4>
<p>Greek city-states, especially Athens, grew and flourished, particularly in the arts.</p>
<h5><strong>Sculptures</strong></h5>
<p><em>Kouros </em>and <em>Kore</em>: grave monuments</p>
<p>Sculptures from temples</p>
<p>Marble; bronze (hollow); limestone; terra cotta; wood; gold</p>
<p>Often painted.</p>
<h5><strong>Pottery</strong></h5>
<p>Potters and vase painters began to sign their works.</p>
<p>Black-figure; red-figure; white ground.</p>
<p>Stiffness and monumentality.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Doric and Ionic orders of architecture emerged.</p>
<p>Roofed, columnar, stone temples.</p>
<p>Altars were positioned in the east end of temples.</p>
<p>Temples were shrines to hold the cult statues and votive offerings.</p>
<p>Temples were built on elevated sites.</p>
<p>Canonical plan—order, compactness, symmetry.</p>
<h4><strong>(2) 27. Anavysos Kouros </strong></h4>
<p>Greek. 530 BCE. Archaic Greek.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-265" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Anavysos-Kouros.jpg?resize=300%2C620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="620" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Anavysos-Kouros.jpg?w=164&amp;ssl=1 164w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Anavysos-Kouros.jpg?resize=145%2C300&amp;ssl=1 145w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> National Archaeological Museum, Athens</p>
<p>This <strong>marble statue stands 6 feet 4 inches tall</strong> and is from the archaic period. This sculpture in the round would have been <strong>painted</strong> and there are still traces of paint in the hair.  As was typical of this period, it is a kouros, or young man, represented in the ideal of perfect, male form.</p>
<p>During this period in art, there was increasing interest in a more lifelike rendering of the human figure. The torso and limbs have greater anatomical accuracy. The figures are more rounded and there is swelling in the hips, calves, abdomen, and cheeks.</p>
<h5><strong>Archaic Kouros characteristics</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pose: left leg out with weight evenly split (just like Menkaure)</li>
<li>Sharp shins</li>
<li>Heavily delineated abs</li>
<li>Traditional braiding of the hair with traditional headband</li>
<li>Archaic smile (figure transcends this world; nobility; knowledge of the peace of the afterlife)</li>
<li>Hands are stuck to the sides creating a sense of stability and even rigidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sculptures were used <strong>offering to the gods </strong>as<strong> grave markings</strong>, as this one was.  It also comes with an inscription:</p>
<p>“Stay and mourn at the monument of the dead Kroises who raging Ares slew as he fought in the front ranks.”</p>
<p>This signifies that the young man Kroises, was killed in war, as Aries was the god of war. This was the most noble way to die, and these men were considered heroes.</p>
<p>Kouros could also be gods. The most frequently portrayed was Apollo.</p>
<h5><strong>Comparing the Athenian Kouros</strong></h5>
<p>An Athenian <strong>Kouros</strong> is identified in several ways. It is nude, muscular, has braided hair worn down, and arms by its side. With a single step forward, it reveals sharp knees. The kouros always has an Archaic smile.</p>
<p>By contrast the <strong>female kore</strong> is never nude. She is depicted as soft and never muscular. Her braided hair is also worn down and her hands are in fists by her side. Her legs are not visible, and she does not step forward. She also wears an archaic smile.</p>
<p>The Athenian kouros figure shares qualities with <strong>Egyptian statuary</strong>. It has even weight, a single step forward, arms down by side and an idealized, muscular body.</p>

<p>A <strong>peplos</strong> is a Greek costume that is made from a rectangular cloth that is pinned at the shoulders. A <strong>kore </strong>is a clothed female figure. This work is <strong>four feet tall</strong> and <strong>made from marble </strong>that was once <strong>painted.</strong> It was <strong>found at the Acropolis, in Athens, Greece.  </strong></p>
<p>The work has similar characteristics to other archaic kores. There is the archaic smile that signifies well-being and is considered transcendent. It is immobile, with arms by the side.</p>
<p>Her clothing is different than other similar figures that were left as offerings to the goddess Athena, at the Acropolis. Under special light, one can detect painting and patterns on her costume. There were patterns of small animals painted vertically down the center of her dress.</p>
<h5><strong>Is Peplos Kore Really Artemis?</strong></h5>
<p>Upon further inspection there has been conjecture that the figure is not a simple woman but the goddess <strong>Artemis</strong>.  The goddess that was later called Diana, by the Romans and was known as the goddess of the hunt.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that she was once carrying a crossbow. Her left arm is bent at the elbow, which indicates that she might have been carrying a bow. The right hand is closed in a fist, that may have held an arrow.</p>
<p>This sculpture goddess or not is considered one of the best examples of sculpture from the archaic period.</p>
<h4><strong>CLASSICAL PERIOD</strong></h4>
<p><strong>480-320 BCE</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The Greeks establish the ideals of beauty, which endured in the Western world. The classical period was divided into three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Classical period, 480-450 BCE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mature Classical period, 450-400 BCE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Late Classical period, 400-325 BCE </strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Classical Period Introduced</strong>:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The weight-shift or contrapposto, stance in statues of standing figures</li>
<li>An appearance of a more relaxed and natural look</li>
<li>Highly idealized figures</li>
<li>Muscular male figures</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Working with Proportions</strong></h5>
<p>During Mature Classical period <strong>Polykleitos</strong> created the <strong>canon of proportions. </strong>This stated that the head of the figure should be one-seventh the length of the body. This altered the tension and relaxed the figure.</p>
<p><strong>Praxiteles</strong> used the head as one-eighth the proportion of the body is his Late Classical period sculptures. This resulted in languorous bodies, with sensual, long lines and an s-curve.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mystery of Greek Paintings</strong></h5>
<p>During the Classical Period artists painted large wooden panels that were displayed in public spaces. All have been lost today, and historians are only certain of their existence through literature<strong>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Classical Vases</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Painting techniques on classical vases include:</p>
<p><strong>Black Figure Technique</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Formed by covering the whole pot with black slip, then scraping it off to reveal the red clay below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Red Figure Technique</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Formed by covering painting the design on the pot in black slip.</li>
<li>More popular because it gives the artist the chance to create greater detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>This <strong>marble copy, with remnants of paint</strong> is a work after a bronze originally by artist Polykleitos. In the sculpture’s hand there was once a spear.</p>
<p>Polykleitos was working in Athens, in the Golden Age of Athenian history and art. There were three philosophical ideas that affect Polykleitos’ work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Idealism: pursuit of perfection (intellectual and physical)</li>
<li>Rationalism: reason and emotion, with calm stoicism and control over the body.</li>
<li>Humanism: the basis for the canon for an ideal man’s height is seven heads.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Canon of Proportion</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-331" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Greek-Sculpture-Proportion.png?resize=667%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="667" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Greek-Sculpture-Proportion.png?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Greek-Sculpture-Proportion.png?resize=278%2C300&amp;ssl=1 278w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Polykleitos sought to create the perfect human body ideal through mathematical form.<strong> Canon of proportion</strong>: head is one-seventh of entire body.</p>
<h5><strong>Contrapposto</strong></h5>
<p>He used <strong>contrapposto</strong>, an uneven weight distributed to the legs, which causes the hips to dip and the shoulders to counterbalance. This is how the body of a real figure would stand.</p>
<h5><strong>Harmony of Opposites</strong></h5>
<p>This theory suggested if both symmetrically and action were achieved in sculpture, it would take on beauty. To achieve a look of movement, it had to look natural, by using the harmony of opposites. If one leg of the sculpture appeared to be moving , then the rest of the body must respond and act accordingly.</p>
<h5><strong>Alternating twisting</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Head to left.</li>
<li>Shoulders/hips to right</li>
<li>Knees to left.</li>
<li>Ankles to right</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Alternating angles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Angle of eyes and shoulders go from top right to bottom left.</li>
<li>Angle of hips go from top left to bottom right.</li>
<li>Angle of knees go from top left to bottom right.</li>
<li>Angle of ankles go from top right to bottom left.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>His right-side vs his left side</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Right side is straightened limbs.</li>
<li>Left side is bent limbs.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Alternating relaxed vs. engaged body parts.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Right arm and left leg are relaxed.</li>
<li>Left arm and right leg are engaged.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What is the Lost Wax Method?</strong></h5>
<p>The original bronze was made using a process called <strong>lost-wax method.</strong></p>
<p>The first step in the lost wax <strong>method</strong> is to make a clay model. Then, it needs to be covered with wax.  The wax clay model is put inside a clay case. A hold is cut at the bottom. Next, the model is heated.  The wax will drip out and leave a small space between the clay interior and the clay case.</p>
<p>Once complete, the artist tips the entire work upside down so that the hole faces upward and pours in liquid bronze. It will fit into that small space where the wax was originally.</p>
<p>Once dry, the artist tilts it back upward again and cracks the clay.</p>
<p>This is called the <strong>lost wax method, </strong>as the wax is lost when it drips out of the clay case.</p>
<p>Also, the process was “lost” after the fall of the Roman Empire.  It was not “discovered” again until Donatello in the 15<sup>th</sup> century during the Southern Renaissance.</p>
<h5><strong>Where the Roman Marble Copy was Found</strong></h5>
<p>This sculpture was found in a palestro, an area where athletes worked out, in Pompeii, Italy. In one hand, the sculpture once held a sphere.  It is thought that this idealized male form, standing at 6 feet 11 inches, was an inspiration of fitness to the athletes.</p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Marble</strong></h5>
<p>Romans liked to work in marble because of its sense of permanence. Bronze is easily damage.  However, the hard part of working with marble is that it is heavy, and figures cannot always stay standing upright and unsupported.</p>
<p>To help support these figures, Romans used <strong>struts,</strong> a piece that joins the arm to the hip, and tree trunks acted as kick stands.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Canon, a Treatise</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong>How to create an ideal statue of a male nude. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Statue should have perfect proportions.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">All parts must relate well to one another.</span></p>
<p><strong>Statue should have <u>symmetria.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Balance of all parts</li>
<li>Action and reaction</li>
<li>Balance and counterbalance</li>
<li>No action is isolated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proportion + symmetria = harmony/beauty</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Ideologies in Classical Greek Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Humanism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Man is the measure of all things.”</li>
<li>Seek an ideal based on the human form, not an arbitrary number.</li>
<li>Man is literally the measure of man himself.</li>
<li>Focus on natural, observed human body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationalism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Reason over emotion”</li>
<li>Expressed by philosophers Sophocles, Plato, and Aristotle</li>
<li>Pursuit of control</li>
<li>Calm stoicism and restraint in face/body</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Idealism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Pursuit of perfection”</li>
<li>Intellectual capacity to understand and execute perfection.</li>
<li>Physical ability to become perfect through discipline.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Lost-Wax Casting Process</strong></h5>
<p>This method was used to caste bronze sculptures. <strong> </strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Athenian Agora</strong>, located in <strong>Athens, Greece</strong>, was a public space, in a flat low area with a rocky Acropolis nearby. It was traversed by an ancient roadway called <strong>Panathenaic way and</strong> held various purposes making it the most important space in Athens at that time. It was used for dramatic performances, cultural or religious events. It was also used as a market through evidence of shops and pieces of pottery, bronzeware and sculpture found at the site.</p>
<p>There was also a council’s chamber, magistrate’s office, mint, and archive. The Athenian agora is  where public elections were had and a place of experimentation in Athenian democracy.</p>
<h5><strong>Panathenaic Procession</strong></h5>
<p>Most buildings were “outlined” with <strong>stoas.</strong> This was a covered walkways or porticos, typically with Doric order. It helped to define the edges of the building and were used as a framing device.</p>
<p>Agora was the main site of a festival, held every four years, called the <strong>Panathenaic Procession </strong>to honor the goddess to Athena. Procession marched across the Agora at a diagonal and culminated on the Acropolis. The culmination of the ceremony was a new woven <strong>peplos </strong>(robe) that was sewn for Athena’s cult statue, in the Parthenon.</p>
<h5><strong>Persian Destruction of Athens</strong></h5>
<p>In 480 BCE, the Persians destructed Athens. Buildings had to be rebuilt or reconstructed.  Many more were added to accommodate the Athenian democracy.</p>

<p>An<strong> Acropolis</strong>, is a rugged rock, in the center of the city that creates a raised platform. Buildings were built here, making the space a major and central religious complex to glorify Athens and Athena. In ancient times there were several buildings built on the site of the Acropolis. Only fragments of many remain today. The most famous one is the <strong>Parthenon.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Parthenon </strong>was created <strong>by architects</strong> <strong>Iktinos and Kallikrates. </strong>It is <strong>1,150 feet long. </strong>Interior décor was provided by <strong>artist Phidias.</strong></p>
<p>The Parthenon was dedicated to the goddess Athena. It glorified Athena Parthenos, the later word meaning virgin, which was highly valued in Athenian society. The goddess was an enforcer of such modesty. The Panathenaic Procession was a celebration of Athena’s birthday.</p>
<p>The north side was the temple of earlier sects and dedicated to earlier gods. The south side contained temples dedicated to Athena. All Athenians citizens were able to take part in the festivals. Only priests were allowed inside.</p>
<p>The building was also a celebration of the Greek victory over the Persians, while showcasing the Athenian wealth and power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>The Build</strong></h5>
<p>The front and back look the same, which was entirely intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Marble</strong> at the time was cheap and available. The roof was originally made with wood and capped with marble tiles. It would have been brightly painted at the time, so viewers could easily see and interpret the decorations.</p>
<h5><strong>Architectural  Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Peripteral</strong> temple is a temple with a <strong>colonnade </strong>on all four sides and based on <strong>peristyle</strong>.</p>
<p>The types of orders or columns used in this building are <strong>Doric and Ionic</strong>. <strong>Doric </strong>was used for is the exterior, with fluted shafts, simple <strong>capitals</strong>, and <strong>entablature</strong> of <strong>triglyphs</strong> and <strong>metopes</strong>. <strong>Ionic </strong>was used is the interior and used fluted shafts, <strong>volute</strong> capitals, with an entablature of frieze.</p>
<p>It was very unusual to combine orders. Art historians believe this was to show a united Greece, with the Doric representing the mainland style and the Iconic the preferred style of the Greek islands.</p>
<p>The building’s <strong>pediment, </strong>a triangular part at the top front of the building that supports the roof was highly carved.</p>
<h5><strong>A Series of Optical Illusions</strong></h5>
<p>Adjustments were made in the architecture to compensate for optical illusions. A <strong>stylobate </strong>or continuous base supporting the row of columns curves upward from the center, as does the <strong>entablature</strong>. This acts to deflect the appearance of sagging in the middle.</p>
<p>Columns lean inward slightly. If the lines were continued, they would all meet 1.5 miles above the temple. Columns are not evenly spaced to prevent the look of them being clustered.  <strong>Entasis </strong>is a slight convex curve in the shaft of a column. The columns bulge out in the middle, and this works to give the illusion that they are straight and taper upward.</p>
<p>The columns in the corners were often surrounded by light. This made them look thinner. To remedy this, the columns here were made 2 inches thicker.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>A Visual of Strength</strong></h5>
<p>All decorations are a symbol of strength. The <strong>metopes</strong> between the channeled <strong>triglyphs </strong>are carved. The west metopes are depicted with Amazonomachy, a mythical battle between the Amazons and Ancient Greeks. The east metopes illustrate the mythical battle between the gods and giants called Gigantomachy. The northside shows the Trojan war, while the south represents Centauromachy, the battle between the mythical centaurs with the Lapiths.</p>
<p>The pediments too provide stunning visuals. The east shows the birth of Athena, while the west is all about Poseidon vs Athena.</p>
<p>The <strong>cella</strong> or main room housed a massive <strong>chryselephantine </strong>statue of Athena, made from gold and ivory. She was fully armed with a shield, spear, and helmet. In her hand, she held Nike, the winged personification of Victory.</p>

<h5><strong>The Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>The<strong> Parthenon </strong>was converted into a Byzantine church, then a Catholic church, in the Middle Ages. Next, it was made into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Greece. In 1678, Venetians attacked the Turks who were using it for storage for ammunition.</p>

<p>These figures were part of the pedimental sculpture on the East pediment that depicts those gathered around the Birth of Athena on Mount Olympus.</p>
<p><strong>From Left to Right</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helios (sun god) now missing, on horses.</li>
<li>Dionysus or Herakles (?)</li>
</ul>
<p>This symbolizes rationalism, idealism, humanism.</p>

<li>Unknown standing figure</li>
<li>Athena and Zeus would have been in the middle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Athena is born from Zeus’s head who complained about a headache to Hephaestus who split Zeus’s head open to find Athena popping out fully armed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The right-hand side shows three goddesses probably Hestia (domesticity), Artemis/Diana (hunt, chastity, nature) and Aphrodite/Venus (love).</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>How Phidias Addresses the Awkward Pediment </strong></h5>
<p>Typically, sculptors ignored the corners since the space was too small to put any full-sized figures in. Phidias, however, uses the bottom line as a horizon line that figures can move through effortlessly. These are extremely life-like in terms of energy and form. The integration of the figures with one another makes them a complicated composition.</p>
<h5><strong>A Sense of Modesty</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Wet Drapery</strong>, in sculptural terms, is defined as the cloth that appears to cling to the body, is animated with numerous folds. This reveals the contours of the body underneath. It also defines the musculature of the body while maintaining propriety for women.</p>
<h5><strong>The Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>The sculpture was damaged when the building was converted into a church.</p>
<p>It was once nicknamed the Elgin Marbles when purchased in 1803 by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to Constantinople. He was accused of “stealing culture” as they are still owned by the British Museum. The work would have almost certainly been destroyed had he not removed them.</p>

<p>Greek. 445-438 BCE. Greek (Style)</p>
<p>Louvre, Paris</p>
<p>This <strong>marble</strong> work is part of the 525 feet long frieze on the inside of the Ionic part of the Parthenon. This section is 96 feet by 2 feet and 7 inches. It is carved in <strong>low relief</strong>. All the figures stand in <strong>contrapposto</strong>. The right knee breaks the fall of drapery.</p>
<p>The artist does not use hierarchy of scale and shows all on the same ground line through <strong>isocephalism</strong>. The work would have originally been painted. The backgrounds were painted blue, and the figures’ hair were highlighted in gold.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Does This Work Represent?</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>original theory</strong> is that it shows the Panathenaic Procession. For this event, the citizens of Athens honor Athena, by weaving a peplos. Six <strong>Ergastines,</strong> or young aristocratic women in charge of weaving the peplos, are greeted by two priests. They all walk in procession towards the Parthenon.</p>
<p>A <strong>new theory</strong> suggests it could be the depiction of the legendary Athenian king, <strong>Erechtheus</strong>, who sacrificed one of his daughters to save the city of Athens. An ancient wooden idol of the goddess Athena was said to have fallen from the skies during his reins. The sacrifice was under the guidance of Oracle of Delphi.</p>
<p>With either theory, the mood of the artwork is sombre as the people wear grave expressions. It shows the religious piety of the upper class, and Athenians at large. It symbolizes the elite community in Athens coming together.</p>

<p><strong>This temple as was dedicated to </strong>Athena Victorious (Athena Nike), not to be confused with the goddess Nike.</p>
<p>This <strong>Amphiprostyle</strong> temple has four columns on the front and back of temple. It is Ionic in order.   It sits oddly on the edge of the Acropolis and there were concerns about it falling off. Around it is a <strong>parapet</strong> or low protective wall or barrier, 4 feet tall that acted as a guard rail.</p>
<p><strong>Temple of Athena Nike</strong> was built over the ruins of a previous temple to Nike, the Persians had destroyed in 480 BCE.  It was built to commemorate the Greek victory over the Persians in the Battle of Marathon, in 490 BCE.  Part of the frieze is also dedicated to this battle.</p>
<p>Inside the temple there was a statue of Athena Nike. Nike’s image is repeated dozens of times. She often holds a pomegranate, a symbol of wealth.</p>

<p>This work depicts an image of Nike, made to be a part of the decorative program of the Temple of Athena Nike. The graceful figure is modeled in <strong>high relief</strong>. Deeply <strong>incised</strong> drapery lines reveal body. <strong>Wet drapery</strong> gives a sense of the weight of the cloth and the gathering around parts of the body. The awkward posture rendered elegant and graceful.</p>
<p>Nike adjusts her sandal while her dress slips off one shoulder.</p>
<p>This was built over the ruins of a previous temple to Nike that the Persians destroyed in 480 BCE.</p>
<h5><strong>Location Choice</strong></h5>
<p>Why was the <strong>Acropolis</strong> chosen? For royal, divine, and physical reasons. Temples have been here since Neolithic times. The elevation  is high up, central, and visible.</p>
<h5><strong>A Historical Look</strong></h5>
<p>Persians destroyed original complex in the Persian War (499 – 449 BCE). It was the site of Delian League Treasury or collection of money from Athenian city states, that was used for combat in the Persian War.</p>
<p>It was constructed under leadership of Pericles, after the Persian sack of Athens, in 480 BCE, and   destroying the original Acropolis. Pericles used the extra funds from the Delian League in the Persian War treasury to build the Acropolis.</p>
<p>The Greek allies were furious, and this caused the Peloponnesian War.</p>

<p>This <strong>marble and paint </strong>stele, at <strong>5 feet tall</strong>,  was crafted to represent the life of a wealthy woman named Hegeso. She is seated on a chair, as her servant presents her with an opened box of jewelry. What the piece was is unclear, as it was painted into Hegeso’s hands and not carved. The image has long since disappeared.</p>
<p>The gown she is wearing is tight against her figure, as the fabric, swirls, and drapes intricately, giving the artist the ability to show a mastery of skills. Gentle scenes such as this one was often selected to show the refinery of the woman who had passed away.</p>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>During the Greek Archaic period, kouros and kore were used as grave markers. Later all efforts were put into great public buildings like the Pantheon. During the fifth century BCE a grave stele or marker started to gain popularity.</p>
<p>This is  a good example of private sculpture and not part of a state commission. It illustrates the greater statue of free-born women with a servants and jewelry; however, it was still a restrictive life. Women’s sphere was in the home, hence the domestic setting.</p>
<p>Women were not considered citizens and were defined by their relationships to men (daughter of Proxenos).</p>

<p>The<strong> Niobides Krater, </strong>is by the artist known only as the <strong>Niobid Painter.</strong> This is a <strong>clay </strong>work. Using <strong>red- figure technique with white highlights</strong>. It stands <strong>two feet tall</strong>.  The piece was found in necropolis <strong>Crucfissio Del Tufo in Orvieto, Italy</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Calyx-krater? </strong></h5>
<p>A<strong> Calyx-krater</strong> is a punch bowl, with two handles on the side. It was used to mix strong wine with water. It is classified within the <strong>decorative arts</strong>, meaning it is both beautiful and functional. Greek vases are described using human anatomical parts such as wide mouth; handles on the base of the body; or wide foot.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the Images</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-245" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/31-Niobides-Fight-Scene.jpg?resize=500%2C517&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="517" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/31-Niobides-Fight-Scene.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/31-Niobides-Fight-Scene.jpg?resize=290%2C300&amp;ssl=1 290w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>On one side of the Greek vase, directly in the centre of the krater is the god Herkules, who is identifiable by the club and lion skin he carries. Around him are warriors, looking for his blessing before leaving for battle. Although the artist may have been aiming for a sense of depth by depicting the figures at various height, all are the same size. The figures are also very stiff and unnatural, as was the style of the time.</p>
<p>On the back of the krater is the story of the mortal Niobe. She bragged that her seven daughters and seven sons were more beautiful than those of the goddess Letos. The goddesses two children, Apollo, the god of arts and music, as well as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt extract revenge on the children by shooting and killing them with bows and arrows.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Niobides Krater </strong> was found in an Etruscan tomb. The Etruscans were Grecophiles. Greek vases were tremendously popular. There were a huge variety of design and function available. The more decorative, the greater the expense.</p>

<p>This<strong> marble </strong>work was built on the <strong>Pergamon</strong> <strong>acropolis</strong>, 800 feet above the city below and about 20 miles from the coast. It was once part of Greece, but today is Turkey.  A panorama of nature was a dramatic background to the action in the altar that measures <strong>117 by 109 feet.</strong></p>
<p>Pergamon was the capital of Attalid Kingdom (Asia Minor). This was one of the four breakup kingdoms from Alexander the Great’s large empire. Today, it is part of Turkey.</p>

<p>The temple was an enclosed courtyard with two sides extending out into arms, with an iconic colonnade. It also has <strong>acroteria</strong>: sculptures in the round placed on a roof. A frieze measuring 7 and a half feet high over 400 feet long wraps around the entire monument. The temple was on a massive podium with a large flight of stairs, verticality toward the heavens.</p>
<p>Surrounding it was a great library, a garrison for soldiers and a royal palace for the king.  Of course, a fire would have been lit in the center for the gods.</p>
<h5><strong>The Depictions</strong></h5>
<p>This alter carved from marble is a depiction of Greek Olympian gods, versus the monstrous offspring of primordial gods Gaia, the earth goddess, and Uranos, the sky god, for world domination.</p>

<p>The gods drag them, physical up the stairs, to show that they will be made to worship to Zeus. Sculptural elements protract outward and use each stair as resting places.</p>
<h5><strong>In Detail</strong></h5>
<p>Hellenistic art began after the death of Alexander the Great. The Hellenistic qualities of this work includes energy, dynamism, movement, emotion, and height of the narrative.  Hellenistic sculpture rejects the rationalism of the Classical era, but retains the idealism , characterized by exaggerated forms, dynamic poses, emotional drama.  This is a <strong>high relief</strong> frieze, with deeply carved figures, that creates shadows and bursts of light.  There are over 100 figures, all of which would have been vividly painted.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work built by Eumenes II, commemorates the defeat of the invading Gauls, led by King Attalos in 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE. It is dedicated to and honors Zeus.</p>
<p>It also has parelells to Pergamon victories over the Barbarians (Gauls) in 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE, as well as Alexander the Great’s defeat of the Persians.</p>
<p>This made a clear statement about Greek victories not only against other culture, but of the unknown. It also established a patriarchal culture with Zeus winning over Gaia.</p>
<p>Animals were sacrificed inside the main temple complex on feast days/festivals.</p>
<h5><strong>Today</strong></h5>
<p>Altar was removed from Pergamon in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by a German archaeologist. It was then reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum, in Berlin.</p>

<p><strong> Museum:</strong> Louvre, Paris</p>
<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong> is a deeply carved figure of <strong>marble</strong>, standing a monumental <strong>9 feet tall</strong>. It is work full of energy. There is a display of movement. Note the dramatic twist and <strong>contrapposto</strong> of the figure. The <strong>wet drapery</strong> imitates the look of water upon the body.</p>
<p><strong>Found on the island of Samothrace</strong> in a sanctuary in a harbor, she faces the way that the wind typically blows, which explains the flutter of the drapery.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong> was built to commemorate a naval victory by the Greeks. Which battle remains unclear, but many scholars point to the Battle of Cos between Macedonians and Egyptians</p>
<h5><strong>Nike the Goddess of Victory</strong></h5>
<p>This work was meant to sit on a fountain, as a figurehead on a boat. The fountain would splash water on the figure as if the waves were dashing up against the ship. The statue would have reflected off the water, giving it a sense of movement.</p>
<p>The <strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong>, is the messenger goddess of victory, <strong>Nike</strong>. Her missing right arm may have raised a victory crown or been held up in greeting. A fragment found in 1948 seems to be from this statue and indicates her arm was raised.</p>
<p>Her clothing is pulled tightly across her abdomen and left leg. It bunches up in thick layers around her front right leg. This makes the figure seem to be alive and breathing. The work is  intensely emotive.</p>
<h5><strong>A Backgrounder on Hellenism</strong></h5>
<p>Hellenism began after the death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE). At this point, the strain and change in Greek life prompted artists to explore a wider range of emotion. This was most apparent in sculpture.</p>
<p>These new works had a greater variety of expression in sculpture, with motion, movement, and energy.</p>

<h4><strong>(2) 41. Seated Boxer </strong></h4>
<p>Greek. 100 BCE. Greek (Hellenistic)</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Hellenistic male sculpture</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Athlete<br />
Ideal male<br />
Psychological</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> National Museum, Rome</p>
<p>This work is a <strong>bronze sculpture</strong> which measures four feet six inches.  In this work <strong>the artist added copper</strong> to show the red wounds of the boxer. While his body is still muscular, years of abuse in the sport show a broken nose, wounds, and a swollen ear.</p>
<p>The artist wants the viewer to be captured by the emotion of the sculpture. The man is exhausted, his posture is stooped.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Perspective</strong></h5>
<p>This work was originally placed in Baths of Diocletian and may have been part of a larger group of works. It is from Hellenistic period, after Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Sculptures of this time frame differed from classical works. The subjects moved from young, perfect images of the ideal and the heroic to more realistic images. After this period, the Romans conquered Greece and expensive bronze was melted down. Sculptures were then made with marble. This is a rare piece of art.</p>

<h3>3500- 331 BCE</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-321" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mesopotamian-Lion-Mosaic.png?resize=990%2C557&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="557" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mesopotamian-Lion-Mosaic.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mesopotamian-Lion-Mosaic.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>Theme: “SBAP”</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SABAP </strong>is an acronym for <strong>Sumerian</strong>, <strong>Babylonian</strong>, <strong>Assyrian</strong>, and <strong>Persian</strong>.  This theme will help you recall the chronological order of the <strong>Ancient Near East Cultures</strong>, as well as remember that the dominant cultures in the Ancient Near East continually replaced one another.</p>
<h5><strong>In Focus</strong></h5>
<p>Artistic traditions focused on representing royal figures and divinities and on the function of funerary and palatial complexes. Works of art illustrate the active exchange of ideas and artistic styles among the Mediterranean cultures and influences on the classical world.</p>
<p>The art of the <strong>ancient Near East</strong> (present day <strong>Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan</strong> , <strong>Cyprus</strong>) is associated with the <strong>city-states and cultures of Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Persia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sumerian Art </strong>(3500 -2340 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Akkadian Art</strong> (2340 &#8211; 2180 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Neo-Sumerian Art</strong> (2150-2000 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Babylonian Art </strong>(1792-1750 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Hittite Art</strong> (1600- 1200 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Assyrian Art</strong> (1000- 612 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Neo-Babylonian</strong> (612-539 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Persian Art</strong> (559- 331 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Artistic innovations</strong> through the development of writing and the human figure, as well as conventions (canons) provides a foundation for subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond. There was constant political change in the region, because of the geography. They were slow to construct unified communities because of the openness to the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>Religion</strong> played a significant role in the art and architecture of the ancient Near East. Cosmology guided representation of deities and kings who, themselves, assumed divine attributes.</p>
<p>Artists created fully developed formal sculptures of <strong>human figures</strong> and artistic conventions representing the <strong>human form</strong>. This was a combination of <strong>profile</strong> and <strong>three-quarter view</strong>. Important figures were designed to be set apart using a <strong>hierarchical scale</strong> or a division of composition into horizontal sections or registers. These works provide early examples of historical narratives.</p>
<p><strong>Architectural representations</strong> include monumental ziggurats and monumental settings for the worship of many deities, that proclaimed the power and authority of rulers. Architecture was restricted by available materials. There were no stone quarries or forests, so the use of <strong>mud sun baked bricks</strong> was the technology.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The Neolithic Revolution first occurred in <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>, a Greek word that means the &#8220;land between the [Tigris and Euphrates] rivers.”</li>
<li>The Tigris and Euphrates were volatile rivers, leading to the belief that animistic gods were temperamental and punishing.</li>
<li>Multiple city-states tried to control these lower valleys.</li>
<li>Ancient Near East art supported the state and religion.</li>
<li>Buildings were created for religion <strong>(ziggurats)</strong></li>
<li>Buildings were created for the state <strong>(palaces)</strong>. Kings realized that art could help them glorify their rules.</li>
<li>Stone was expensive, wood was scarce, but earth/dirt was abundant.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mesopotamia</strong> was located in <strong>present-day Iraq and eastern Syria</strong>. Located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, this region was perfect for the establishment of early agriculture. The earliest development of agriculture in this region dates to about 9000 B.C.E., during the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, period.</p>
<p>The people who lived in this <strong>fertile area</strong> were able to grow and store food, and they no longer had to rely on a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle. As a result, they began settling areas to tend to their crops, and towns and cities arose. Agriculture slowly transformed the civilizations in other areas of the Ancient Near East as well an area that also includes Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Cyprus.</p>
<p>Between 3500 B.C.E and 330 B.C.E., successive societies rose to power through invasions with <strong>the goal to control the wealth, water (for irrigation), and agricultural resources of the area</strong>. The balance of power shifted between outside invaders and local powers.</p>
<p>The Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian (or SANBAN) societies, followed by Persia, <strong>influenced each other culturally</strong> by reacting to or rejecting the previous culture. Their art and architecture reflect these reactions, rejections, and cultural interconnections.</p>

<h5><strong>Sumerian Influence</strong></h5>
<p>In the fourth millennium B.C.E., a civilization called Sumer arose in southern Mesopotamia. The <strong>Sumerians</strong> were united by a common language and a religious culture that ruled independent, and often competitive, political entities called city-states.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sumerians developed cuneiform, the first writing system</strong>, and distinct forms of art and architecture, including <strong>votive figures, cylinder seals, and the ziggurat</strong>, which emphasized the power of the king.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-226" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Statues-of-votive-figures.jpg?resize=558%2C753&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="558" height="753" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Statues-of-votive-figures.jpg?w=243&amp;ssl=1 243w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Statues-of-votive-figures.jpg?resize=222%2C300&amp;ssl=1 222w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Akkadian Influence</strong></h5>
<p>Although their cultural and technological innovations would have a strong influence on many later cultures, the Sumerian people eventually fell under the power of the <strong>Akkadians</strong>. The ruler of the Akkadians, Sargon, united all the Sumerian city-states, ruling from his capital of Akkad.</p>
<p>This introduced <strong>the concept of royal rule</strong> based on unwavering loyalty to the king rather than to the individual city-state. While the Akkadians had their own language, they used the Sumerian writing system. Few artifacts can be identified with the Akkadians, but what has been discovered includes the <strong>Head of an Akkadian ruler</strong> and the <strong>Stele of Naram-Sin</strong>. The Akkadian Empire fell around 2180 B.C.E. to the Guti, a mountain people from the northeast.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2366" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Head-of-an-Akkadian-ruler-Sargon..jpg?resize=688%2C688&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="688" height="688" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Head-of-an-Akkadian-ruler-Sargon..jpg?w=425&amp;ssl=1 425w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Head-of-an-Akkadian-ruler-Sargon..jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Head-of-an-Akkadian-ruler-Sargon..jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Head-of-an-Akkadian-ruler-Sargon..jpg?resize=270%2C270&amp;ssl=1 270w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Head-of-an-Akkadian-ruler-Sargon..jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Head of an Akkadian ruler (Sargon)</em>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Neo-Sumerian Influence</strong></h5>
<p>Gutians controlled most of Mesopotamia for a brief time, but the Sumerian people regained control and expelled the Guti under the leadership of King Urnammu of Ur. He reintroduced the Sumerian language and <strong>commissioned architecture like the Ziggurat of Ur</strong>. This Neo-Sumerian period was short-lived, as they were conquered by the Amorites.</p>
<h5><strong>Babylonian Influence</strong></h5>
<p>The Amorites reunited Mesopotamia under the ruler, Hammurabi. The capital city was Babylon and therefore, the subjects were called Babylonians. Hammurabi re-instituted the Akkadian language and a written legal code that detailed specific laws and consequences in <strong>T<em>he Code of Hammurabi</em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Code of Hammurabi. Babylon (modern Iran). Susian. c. 1792–1750 B.C.E. Basalt</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hittites later conquered Babylon in 1595 B.C.E., and Mesopotamia entered a period of transition dominated by foreign peoples.</p>
<h5><strong>Assyrian Influence</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Assyrians</strong> emerged in the period of transition after the fall of the Babylonian empire. The Assyrians constructed three major cities—Kalhu, Dur Sharrukin, and Nineveh. The spaces of these cities were carefully controlled to create an impression of magnificence and grandeur and were <strong>embellished with expansive relief sculptures depicting warfare, hunting, and ceremonial scenes.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Sargon II and dignitary</em>.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Lamassu</strong></em> from the citadel of <strong><em>Sargon II </em></strong>and<em><strong> Sargon II and dignitary</strong></em>, was designed to awe foreign viewers with the Assyrians’ power and ferocity. The Assyrian empire collapsed when it was confronted by the newly resurgent city of Babylon.</p>
<h5><strong>Neo-Babylonian Influence</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Babylonians</strong> enjoyed a resurgence when they destroyed the Assyrian empire at the end of the seventh century B.C.E. The most famous Neo-Babylonian ruler was Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605–562 B.C.E.), who reconstructed Babylon in grand style and built the <strong>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</strong>, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2368" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Ishtar-Gate..jpg?resize=990%2C728&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="728" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Ishtar-Gate..jpg?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Ishtar-Gate..jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Ishtar-Gate..jpg?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Ishtar-Gate..jpg?resize=1536%2C1129&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Ishtar-Gate..jpg?w=1560&amp;ssl=1 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em><strong>The Ishtar Gate</strong></em></p>
<p>The art of Babylon continued the tradition of <strong>monumental architecture and intimidating relief sculpture</strong>, as exemplified in <em><strong>The Ishtar Gate</strong>.</em></p>
<h5><strong>Persian Influence</strong></h5>
<p>Under the Achaemenid dynasty, the <strong>Persians</strong> created the largest empire the Ancient Near East had yet seen, stretching from Iran to Egypt. Under kings Darius I (r. 521–486 B.C.E.) and Xerxes (r. 485–465 B.C.E.), they constructed a vast capital city, Persepolis.</p>
<p>Persepolis reflected not only continuity with Mesopotamian tradition but also the multicultural influences from the Persian Empire, Egypt, and Greece</p>
<h5><strong>Temples</strong></h5>
<p>The Sumerians lived in a world created and supervised by <strong>a pantheon of gods and goddesses</strong> who were each associated with specific natural forces or human endeavors. Emulating the power structures of the divine realm, each Sumerian city-state was under the protection of a deity. The <strong>main temple</strong> of the city was dedicated to its protective deity and located at the center of the city-state on a ziggurat, a large trapezoidal platform. The height of the ziggurat indicates the desire to reach to the heavens or connect with the deities. Ziggurats could sometimes have many levels and were used by most subsequent civilizations of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>The <strong>central location of the temple</strong> is representative of the importance of the city-state deity and the impact of the deity upon daily life.</p>
<p><em><strong>The White Temple</strong></em> is one of the earliest ziggurats from the city-state Uruk. As Sumerian builders did not have access to stone quarries, they <strong>built the temple from mudbrick</strong>, which was fragile. This has resulted in the erosion of the temple, but there is enough of the temple still standing to allow a dependable reconstruction.</p>
<h5><strong>Figural Representations, Sumerian Style</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Statues of deities</strong> placed in Sumerian temples were often representations like the <em><strong>Mask of Waka</strong>.</em> Masks like this were on a full-size wooden body and painted with inlaid stones and shells for eyebrows and eyes and hair of gold. Stones were very valuable and were used sparingly, as they were not commonly found, so the <em><strong>Mask of Waka</strong></em> would have been brought to Uruk at a great cost.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mask of Waka</em>. Uruk C. 3300-3000 B.C.E. Marble</strong></p>
<p>This demonstrates the importance of the deity’s image to worshipers in Sumerian culture. The Sumerians referred to their temples as “waiting rooms,” a reflection of their belief that the deity would descend from the heavens to appear before the priests in the cella.</p>
<p>There were also statue representations of those who worship the deities in the Sumerian temples. The forms of the bodies of the <strong>Statues of votive figures</strong> are simplified and lack details of musculature. Standing on large, sturdy feet, each figure is erect and attentive in posture, theoretically in an expected posture of worship.</p>
<p>They always hold a small vessel in front of his or her body as an offering to the gods, and their hands seem to be folded in prayer around them. They have enormous, saucer-like eyes that are wide open and elevated as if they are looking at the deity and as a sign of piety. The eyes and eyebrows would be inlaid with dark stone in a similar fashion to the <strong>Mask of Waka</strong>.</p>
<p>These <strong>Statues of votive figures</strong> are not portraits intended to represent the physical appearance of specific people; rather, they symbolically stand in place of the worshippers, offering prayers in their place night and day in the temple.</p>
<h5><strong>Sculptural Status</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Head of an Akkadian ruler (Sargon)</strong></h5>
<p>Cultures that thrived after the Sumerian culture’s decline demonstrated figural representations of leaders similar to the Sumerian representations of deities. The Akkadians ruled in Mesopotamia between the Sumerian and Neo-Sumerian periods, beginning with their first king, Sargon of Akkad.</p>
<p><strong>The Head of an Akkadian ruler (Sargon)</strong> employs highly stylized elements, such as the corkscrew curls in the beard like those in the Bull-headed lyre, eyebrows, hair, and headdress, which all indicate the royalty and ideal male appearance of the leader.</p>
<p>While the head was initially a tribute to and symbol of the ruler’s power, damage to the left side of the face and removal of the inlaid eyes appears deliberate and suggests that the head was symbolically destroyed to put an end to its power, deprive its ability to hear and see, and end the reign of the Akkadian ruler.</p>
<h5><strong>Stele of Naram-Sin</strong></h5>
<p>The grandson of Sargon I was also portrayed in Akkadian artworks. The <strong>Stele of Naram-Sin</strong> emphasizes the authority and power in warfare of Naram-Sin using hierarchical scale. Like the <strong>Standard of Ur</strong>, the stele is read from bottom-left to the top-right.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2371" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stele-of-Naram-Sin.jpg?resize=590%2C918&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="590" height="918" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stele-of-Naram-Sin.jpg?w=349&amp;ssl=1 349w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stele-of-Naram-Sin.jpg?resize=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1 193w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Stele of Naram-Sin</em> </strong></p>
<p>King Naram-Sin is not only the largest figure but is also seen in the highest place on the mountain. The soldiers are portrayed as all looking up to him, further emphasizing his elevated position in their society. He and his army are shown as victorious, completely overpowering the opposing soldiers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227" style="width: 595px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-227" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Standard-of-Ur-Peace.jpg?resize=595%2C401&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="595" height="401" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-227" class="wp-caption-text">Y</figcaption></figure>
<p>In contrast to the <strong>Standard of Ur</strong>, registers are not used. Space is depicted through the position of the figures, indicating a diagonal progression up the mountainside. Because the composition is set in a landscape, Naram-Sin approaches the top of the composition, confidently reaching the stars and heavens, and therefore identifying him with deities. His horned headdress is also a symbol of his association with the gods in early Mesopotamian cultures and suggests his godlike status.</p>
<h5><strong>Seated Gudea</strong></h5>
<p>In contrast to the demonstrations of power and authority of the Akkadians, the Neo-Sumerian leader <strong>Gudea</strong> presented himself not only to emphasize his power, but to also demonstrate his religious devotion. The statue’s upward gaze reflects his piety and humility before the gods, but the fact that he is seated shows that, although he is connected to the gods, he is still accessible and dedicated to his people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2374" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-Gudea-2.jpg?resize=561%2C719&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="561" height="719" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-Gudea-2.jpg?resize=234%2C300&amp;ssl=1 234w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-Gudea-2.jpg?resize=1196%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1196w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-Gudea-2.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=561%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1122w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Seated Gudea</em></strong></p>
<p>His arms are strong and powerful with clearly defined musculature, indicating his political strength. His large head is meant to indicate his intelligence and wisdom. Unlike Naram-Sin, he does not wear the horned headdress of the gods. In this way, Gudea depicts his leadership rather than the art style of the Akkadian conquerors.</p>
<h4><strong>Powerful Narratives</strong></h4>
<p>From the <strong>Neo-Sumerian era</strong>, the <em>Standard of Ur</em> was found in the tomb of King Meskalamdug and Queen Pu-Abi, along with precious objects, or grave goods, and the bodies of servants intended for the use, enjoyment, and service of their masters in the afterlife. The standard <strong>used narrative to express both a story and support of the ruler in the story.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Standard of Ur has two sides</em></strong>: one symbolizing <strong>war</strong> and one symbolizing <strong>peace</strong>. Both sides present a story and are divided into three registers. The registers are distinguished by a ground line. The images are read left to right, beginning in the lower left-hand corner and ending in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
<p>Similar narrative forms are included on various <strong>Sumerian artworks</strong>, including musical instruments. Musical instruments, such as lyres, were included with grave goods placed within the burial chambers. The registers on the <strong><em>Bull–headed lyre</em></strong>, like the <strong><em>Standard of Ur</em></strong>, would most likely be read from bottom to top.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2386" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bell-headed-lyre.jpg?resize=933%2C307&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="933" height="307" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bell-headed-lyre.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bell-headed-lyre.jpg?resize=300%2C99&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Bull-headed lyre </em>and detail from tomb at Royal Cemetery. Ur, Iraq. ca. 2600 B.C.E. Wood, gold, lapis lazuli.</strong></p>
<p>It culminates with the most important figure, the man between the two bulls, who is shown in the center. The detail from the lyre depicts a banquet, just as the peace side of the standard. The attendants bring food and wine for the celebration. As in the <strong><em>Standard of Ur</em></strong>, a lyre player entertains the guests. The man at the top of the composition is clearly an important figure. Because the lyre was buried with the king in the grave, the power of the man, shown subduing two bulls, likely reflects the power and position of the king.</p>
<p>The <strong>Babylonians</strong> employed narrative similar to that in Sumerian artworks. In the <strong><em>Code of Hammurabi</em></strong>, a code of rules and regulations, the Babylonian ruler is depicted approaching the sun god Shamash. Shamash gives him the ring and rod, symbols of authority.</p>
<p>The <strong>Egyptian</strong> culture also used narrative to show the connection of the elite to deities. An extremely well-preserved example is the <strong>Last judgment of Hu-Nefer</strong>. The scroll made of papyrus, was found in the tomb of a royal priest, and was placed among the wrappings of Hu-Nefer’s mummified body to help him reach his final destination in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The scrolls depict scenes from what the Egyptians considered the last judgment after death—two tests presided over by Osiris, the god of the underworld. Egyptians believed the deceased were questioned about their behavior in life and their hearts were weighed. Egyptians believed the heart to house the soul. The deceased were then presented to Osiris. The figures are presented in composite view, like in the <strong><em>Standard of Ur</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The figure of Hu-Nefer is presented on an equal scale with the figures performing the ceremony. But the god Osiris is portrayed as much larger than the other figures, even while sitting, demonstrating Egyptian use of hierarchical scale. Similar to <strong><em>Hammurabi in the Code of Hammurabi</em></strong>, Hu-Nefer’s ability depicted alongside the gods is a symbol of his authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Power, the Assyrian Way</strong></h5>
<p>Another frequently depicted <strong>subject in Assyrian relief sculpture was the ritual animal hunt</strong>. Among the many animals hunted was the <strong>Mesopotamian lion</strong>. King Ashurnasirpal II aims his bow at a male lion who charges his chariot from behind while the king’s driver concentrates on steering the chariot in <em><strong>Ashurbanipal Hunting Lions</strong>.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2375" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ashurbanipal-Hunting-Lions.jpg?resize=797%2C608&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="797" height="608" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ashurbanipal-Hunting-Lions.jpg?w=797&amp;ssl=1 797w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ashurbanipal-Hunting-Lions.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ashurbanipal-Hunting-Lions.jpg?resize=768%2C586&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Ashurbanipal Hunting Lions</em> from the Palace of Ashurbanipal. ca. 645–640 B.C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The lions are shown as ferocious adversaries who fight to the death. The king is able to defeat them and, thus, reinforces his power.</p>
<p>The lion hunt was an enduring theme in Assyrian art and was also shown on the walls of the citadel at Nineveh two centuries later. These hunts did not take place in the wild but were staged events. <strong><em>Dying Lion</em></strong> and the<strong><em> Dying Lioness</em></strong> demonstrate the power and ferocity of these animals and emphasize the king’s own power in overcoming them, and, like the scenes of warfare, the lion-hunt scenes implied a violent response to anyone who threatened to rebel against the Assyrian king. Although viewers today may observe the suffering of the lions with sympathy, an Assyrian viewer may have seen the creatures as vicious menaces whose slaughter by the Assyrian king represented his ability to protect his own subjects from chaos and destruction. In their use of space and specific detail, the lion hunts had propaganda functions that were similar to the images of warfare discussed previously.</p>

<p>The empire of the Assyrians collapsed when they were challenged by the newly resurgent city of Babylon. Under Nebuchadnezzar II, Babylon rose to prominence in the 6th century B.C.E. as a city full of decorative features like the famous <strong>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</strong>, seen in the reconstruction drawing of the city.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2378" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Babylon.jpg?resize=807%2C588&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="807" height="588" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Babylon.jpg?w=807&amp;ssl=1 807w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Babylon.jpg?resize=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Babylon.jpg?resize=768%2C560&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Reconstruction of Babylon. 6th century B.C.E.</strong></p>
<p>Most of <strong>the city of Babylon survives only through textual accounts</strong>, such as the Greek historian Herodotus&#8217;s Histories, or through archaeological reconstruction. The historical figure of Nebuchadnezzar II is also known from the Bible as the king who destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem in 586 B.C.E. The <strong>Ishtar Gate</strong> has survived in relatively good condition, and most of it has been reconstructed and is displayed in Berlin and other European museums.</p>
<p>The gate was constructed of mudbrick, like other structures in southern Mesopotamia. The Babylonian artists used the technique of glazed brick to approximate the appearance of stone bas-relief as seen in the Assyrian artworks.</p>
<p>The <strong>three animals depicted on the gates</strong> and the walls leading up to the gates are <strong>lions, bulls, and dragons.</strong> These animals were sacred to the Babylonian gods. During the Babylonian New Year’s procession, statues of the gods would be carried down the way leading up to and through the gate to their temples inside the city as the people watched.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture and decoration were a ritual display of power.</strong></h5>
<p>The <em><strong>Detail of a lion</strong></em> is from the processional way leading up to the Ishtar gate. Each individual brick had to be molded, fired, and glazed before being assembled. The well-preserved colored bricks demonstrate how colorful Assyrian reliefs were before their paint wore away. The lion’s ferocity matches that of its Assyrian ancestors, though he stands on a ground line in an orderly fashion, not as the prey of the hunter.</p>

<h5><strong>Persian Power Representations</strong></h5>
<p>The Neo-Babylonian resurgence was short-lived. The Persians invaded Mesopotamia in the late 6th century B.C.E., creating an empire that surpassed the territory controlled by the Assyrians. The Persian rulers traced their ancestry to a figure named Achaemenes, and thus this early Persian family of rulers was known as the Achaemenid dynasty.</p>
<p>The Persian kings organized a vast administrative network and system of taxation. Under kings Darius I (r. 521–486 B.C.E.) and Xerxes (r. 485–465 B.C.E.), they built the City of Persepolis, which reflected both the extent of their power and the diversity of the peoples over whom they ruled.</p>
<p>The <strong>central space in Persepolis was the apadana, or audience hall</strong>. It was decorated with relief sculptures reflecting the absolute power of the king over his vast empire. The Persians did not generally use hunting or battle scenes to intimidate. Rather, the decoration of Persepolis conveyed the power of the Persians through the representation of innumerable guards and soldiers, suggesting the unconquerable nature of the Persian Empire. The concept of showing power through numbers was continued in the Hall of 100 Columns.</p>

<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>cultures of the Ancient Near East include the Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian (or SANBAN), followed by Persia</strong>. These cultures influenced each other by reacting to or rejecting the previous culture, evidenced in each culture&#8217;s art and architecture. <strong>Ziggurats </strong>represented reverence for the deity of the city-state within Sumerian culture and later were duplicated in other cultures as a claim to power and legitimacy in the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Sculptures</strong> functioned as propaganda to demonstrate the power and authority within Akkadian and Neo-Sumerian cultures. Babylonian and Assyrian cities functioned as <strong>administrative centers, often fortified with gates intended to control visitors </strong>and convey the ruler&#8217;s power.</p>
<p>Persia succeeded the SANBAN societies and demonstrated the extent of their power and diversity of the peoples over whom they ruled in the City of Persepolis</p>

<p><strong><em>White Temple and is ziggurat</em></strong> were built in <strong>Urek</strong>, which in modern times is <strong>Warka, in Iraq</strong>. It is made of <strong>baked mud brick</strong>, as stone was too expensive, and wood had to be imported.  The base of the ziggurat <strong>measures 40 feet</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>buttress</strong> is spaced across the surface to create a light and shadow pattern. This helps rainwater to wash down pre-designed channels and to strengthen the building.</p>
<p>The <strong>façade </strong>or exterior of the building, was whitewashed, with ground white shells or bone. Its purpose was to attract the sun and provide illumination. Rectangular in structure, it measures 17.5 meters by 22.3 meters.</p>
<p>People would ascend via staircase or ramp  as the <strong>ground plan</strong> reveals . This would bring people to the top, but not directly to the entryway (<strong>bent axis</strong>)</p>

<h5><strong>What is a ziggurat?</strong></h5>
<p>A ziggurat is a raised platform. It elevated the White Temple to make it visible.  This ziggurat is the earliest one that still exists.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was this Built?</strong></h5>
<p>The temple functioned as a dedication <strong>to the sky God Anu</strong>.  It was a place for public prayer, worship, and ritual. Priests and royalty had access to the temple at the top.</p>
<h5><strong>Into the Darkness</strong></h5>
<p>The interior of temple was very dark to symbol of the presence of the divine.  Darkness was  considered magical, mysterious, and the place where deities and supernatural forces resided.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>This is the earliest ziggurat that survives. Neolithic civilizations placed tremendous significance on religious institutions. A temple was the spiritual, literal, economic and political center of a community. There were no burials here.</p>

<p>Found in <strong>Tell Azmar, Iraq,</strong> <strong><em>Statues of votive figures, from the Square Temple at Eshnunna</em></strong> were crafted from <strong>gypsum, inlaid, </strong>or embedded<strong>, with shell and black limestone</strong>. The tallest stands at <strong>2 feet and 6 inches</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Votive Offerings</strong></h5>
<p>The function of votive figures was to replicate the donor, in an act of prayer to the gods. This would represent prayer 24 hours a day, as the gods were temperamental.</p>
<p>These would have been placed in the temple of the god Abu, the god of vegetation, facing a statue or alter of a god. These sculptures were represented on a <strong>hierarchy of scale</strong>, in that a wealthier person would have a much larger sculpture.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The eyes are wide, as if in awe. Men are depicted with bare chest and arms, while woman were fully clothed for modesty.   On the backs of the sculptures are the words “ it offers prayer”.</p>
<h5><strong>What was Animism?</strong></h5>
<p>The religion in Mesopotamia was <strong>Animism</strong>, a belief that natural forces were controlled by the gods. There was a god of rain, a god of water and many more.  They also believed these gods were easily angered.</p>

<p>The Standard of Ur from the Royal Tombs at Ur, was found in<strong> Tell el-Muqayyar, Iraq</strong>,  in what appeared to be a tomb of a soldier. A standard is something brought to war, hence the name.</p>
<p>The <strong>wooden box, measuring 8.5 inches tall by 19.5 inches wide</strong> is decorated with <strong>white shells</strong>, (from the Persian Gulf) <strong>lapis lazuli</strong> (from Afghanistan) and <strong>red limestone</strong> (from India). This is both a symbol of the wealth of Mesopotamian (Sumerian) groups, and cross-cultural trade.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the box held. Some historians think it could have been used for a musical instrument or for a coin box.</p>
<p>This double-sided artwork shows three <strong>registers</strong>, depicting the three segments of society. It is a <strong>historical narrative</strong> about war and peace.</p>
<h5><strong>Peace </strong></h5>

<p>At <strong>the top</strong> are the elite. The king is depicted as the largest figure, seated on a throne. Other members of the king’s group are also seated. All are raising glasses. Servants are depicted as smaller figures. Entertainers are entering to the far right.</p>

<p>At <strong>the top</strong> Sumerian king has exited his chariot. He inspects his captives who are nude. This was a way of debasing people in Mesopotamia. The <strong>middle </strong>register illustrates of the Sumerian army revealed through a line of soldiers.  At the <strong>bottom</strong>, rather than seeing many chariots, we are seeing one chariot in continuous a narrative, move from a walk to a canter to a gallop.</p>

<p>Once again, this work is a <strong>stele</strong> or a stone slab to mark a gravesite, standing <strong>7 feet 6 inches tall</strong>. At the top it is a <strong>relief sculpture.</strong> This is a sample of <strong>low relief</strong>. It has <strong>incised/intaglio</strong> text that is carved into the material. The figures show a <strong>twisted perspective</strong>, in that they are viewed in profile, with the shoulders facing forward. This work also shows a <strong>Hierarchy of scale</strong>. The seated figure (god) if he stood would be taller than standing figure.</p>
<h5><strong>Images Up Close</strong></h5>
<p>This stele is representational of the law and designed in three sections.</p>
<p>At the <strong>top left</strong> is a carved relief of King Hammurabi on the, who ruled Babylonia from 1792-1750 BCE.</p>
<p>To <strong>the right</strong> is Shamash, the sun god and god of justice.  This is indicated by the horned crown on his head and the beams of divine light radiating from his shoulders. The god is seated on a temple throne or <strong>ziggurat</strong> that is perched upon mountains. He is gifting the king with a rope, rod, and ring, as a sign of power. Hammurabi is speaking in greeting and gesturing. He stands respectfully in front of Shamash.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Text</strong></h5>
<p>There are three passages. The first is the justification of Hammurabi as king as well as a glorification.  Below this is a section of 300 laws, inscribed in <strong>cuneiform script</strong>, in the <strong>Akkadian language</strong>. This determines the result of any wrong actions, which has already been established through legal precedence.</p>
<p>For example, it says:</p>
<p><em>If a man builds a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls and kills its owner, then the builder shall be put to death. </em></p>
<p>The third section of text is a poem praising Hammurabi’s virtues.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of The Code of Hammurabi </strong></h5>
<p>This work was crafted to ensure that the laws were known to the public. It includes images, as the literacy rate was extremely low in ancient civilizations. These laws give a sense in history to what was important in Babylonian laws.</p>
<p>It also glorified Hammurabi, as a pious and obedient ruler. The poem on the stele makes it clear that he is responsible for bringing the law to the people.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This work is the earliest law code ever written and likely predates the Old Testament commandments. It was exhibited at the city of Sippar in the Babylonian kingdom, with  multiple copies placed around the kingdom.</p>

<p>These winged bulls, with heads of men, known as <strong>lamassu</strong>, were <strong>each carved from one alabaster stone</strong>. These massive sculptures, each <strong>10 to 14 feet tall</strong> were guardian figures at the citadel fortress protecting the town, <strong>Dur Sharrukin,</strong> in what is now modern Khorsabad, Iraq.</p>
<p>These works were an expression of grandeur by Sargon II, meant to ward off enemies, both real and invisible or <strong>apotropaic</strong>.  The huge palace complex had 200 rooms, with 30 different courtyards. Much of the artwork inside showed narrative scenes of Sargon in warfare and the hunts.</p>
<h5><strong>Details of the Lamassu</strong></h5>
<p>The lamassu were made to be viewed both from the front and from the side. These works were highly decorative. Parts are carved in <strong>high relief</strong> and parts in <strong>low relief</strong>.</p>
<p>The crown upon the head of each lamassu contains rosettes and double horns, along with a ring of feathers along the top. The human face contains a unibrow. The wavy hair and beard form ringlets and spirals. The only part of the face that is not human are the ears. These are the ears of a bull, with earrings that dangling down.</p>
<p>Under his body and around legs are inscriptions in cuneiform, which declare power of the king and threaten anyone who ignores this.</p>
<p>The legs are a trick to the eye. There are five legs per sculpture. As you approach the lamassu you can only see two, as if the creature is standing guard. There are four as it you start to move past the animal. It creates the visual illusion that it moves to let you in!</p>

<p>This <strong>mud-brick building, with limestone facing</strong> was built as part of the palace for Darius I, in Persepolis, in what is today Iran. There are 72 columns and two monumental stairways, with a wooden roof. Artificial terraces were created so it could be built on higher ground. The building is <strong>65 feet tall</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Apadana </strong>(hall) was a <strong>hypostyle</strong>, or roof raised up by multiple columns, created a forest of columns. Some have bull headed capitals. The bulls are one continuous facing, turning outward from each other, with two separate heads. Traces of color at other sites suggest these were brightly painted.</p>

<h5><strong>How was this Building Used?</strong></h5>
<p>The hall was used for used for receptions, festivals, and banquets by the king. When receiving his visitors here, he was able to display his power and magnificence.</p>
<p>Decoration on the interior matches the activities that would happen in the room. This included thousands of people carved into the walls, representing 23 nations.</p>
<p>It would later by destroyed by Alexander the Great, along with the power of Persia.</p>

<h3>3,500-300 BCE</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-404" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Egyptian-Art-Title-Page.jpg?resize=990%2C559&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="559" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Egyptian-Art-Title-Page.jpg?w=626&amp;ssl=1 626w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Egyptian-Art-Title-Page.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5>Influences</h5>
<p><strong>Geographic isolation</strong>: civilization is defendable, homogeneous culture = continuous traditions</p>
<p><strong>Economic security</strong>: agricultural base due to inundation of the Nile = prosperity, continuity</p>
<p><strong>Deeply held religious beliefs</strong>: Pharaoh son of god, hierarchical society = stability/aversion to change</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchical society</strong>: Pharaoh top of “pyramid” = collective will/aversion to change</p>
<p><strong>Geological substructure</strong>: plethora of stone = megalithic architecture, permanence</p>
<p><strong>Belief in the Afterlife</strong>: elaborate funereal traditions, objects, and tomb architecture.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Traditions</strong></h5>
<p>Artistic traditions focused on representing royal figures and divinities and on the function of funerary and palatial complexes.</p>
<p>Works of art illustrate the active exchange of ideas and artistic styles among the Mediterranean cultures and influences on the classical world. The art of dynastic Egypt (present day <strong>Egypt and Sudan</strong> from 3000 to 30 BCE) includes <strong>pre-dynastic Egypt</strong> and <strong>Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Amarna period (New Kingdom)</strong> was important because of its cultural reform and stylistic revolution. Artistic innovations and conventions (canons) provide a foundation for subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond.</p>
<p>The art of dynastic Egypt embodied a sense of permanence. It was created for eternity and focused on preserving a cycle of rebirth. The culture represents an elaborate funerary sect whose devotees created <strong>ka statues</strong> to house the spirit after death. They also created <strong>artifacts, decorations</strong>, and <strong>furnishings for tombs. </strong></p>
<p>Egyptian art incorporated <strong>mythological</strong> and <strong>religious symbolism</strong> often centered on the cult of the sun.</p>
<p>Development of monumental <strong>stone architecture</strong> culminated with the pyramids and innovative designs for rock-cut tombs and pylon temples, each demonstrating the importance of the pharaoh &#8211; a god-king with absolute power, descended directly from the sun god.</p>
<p>The Egyptian architectural construction of <strong>the clerestory</strong> is important for the history of architecture.</p>
<p>Representations of humans made clear distinctions between deified pharaohs and lower classes, using <strong>hierarchical proportion</strong> and idealization versus naturalism. The artistic canon of dynastic Egypt, with strict conventions of representation, use of materials, and treatment of forms, was followed for centuries with only short-lived periods of experimentation and deviation.</p>
<h5><strong>Theme: “Tombs, Temples, Timelessness”</strong></h5>
<p>This theme reminds us that much of Egyptian art was created for <strong>tombs or temples</strong>. Both the style and the media of Egyptian works can be discussed in relation to the idea of permanence and tradition.</p>

<p>Egyptian statues were lifelike. Faces were expressive and muscles well-defined. A strong sense of balance and stasis evoked a sense of timelessness, connecting to the concept of immortality. The canon of proportion applied to statues and painted images. These statues were <strong>built to be permanent</strong>, as they <strong>housed the ka and ensured its survival</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2300" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2300" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2300" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/King-Djoser.jpg?resize=500%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="640" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/King-Djoser.jpg?w=328&amp;ssl=1 328w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/King-Djoser.jpg?resize=234%2C300&amp;ssl=1 234w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2300" class="wp-caption-text">King Djoser</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>King Djoser</strong> from the temple next to the Step Pyramid was <strong>created with the subtractive method</strong>, in which excess material is removed to sculpt the desired form. General outlines on the exterior of the block guided the artist when sculpting the stone. Incised details and smoothed surfaces completed the process. The result was a figure with a bilaterally symmetrical face and balanced body with ideally proportioned features. Damaged by tomb robbers, the statue of Djoser was carved for the serdab chamber in the funerary complex at Saqqara.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2301" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2301" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2301" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Khafre.jpg?resize=500%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Khafre.jpg?w=356&amp;ssl=1 356w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Khafre.jpg?resize=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1 231w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2301" class="wp-caption-text">Khafre</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The statue of Khafre</strong> was recovered from his valley temple. The pose, sense of serenity, order, and power represent his divinity and transcendence of earthly life. <strong>The falcon god Horus rests</strong> on the back of the throne and embraces Khafre’s head with its wings.</p>
<p><strong>Images of lions, papyrus, and lotus plants ornament the throne</strong>, symbolizing the king’s power over Upper (lotus) and Lower (papyrus) Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>Khafre is carved from gneiss</strong>, a very hard stone like granite. The gneiss has a rare quality. In sunlight it glows blue, the color of Horus. Light from openings in the roof would have filled the room, with its white alabaster floor, with a celestial radiance.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Funerary art: dedicated to continuing this life into the next world.</li>
<li>Canon of proportion</li>
<li>Gender: men are taller and ruddy brown or red; women are shorter and yellowish</li>
<li>Content and peaceful scenes</li>
</ul>
<p>Egyptian painting followed well-defined practices in the representation of figures, the identification of relationships of power, and the organization of space. These stylistic elements express a culture in which roles were clearly articulated and life was orderly.</p>
<p>Many works included ground lines that organize space vertically into registers. The lowest register frequently shows objects and figures nearest to the viewer.</p>
<p>Paintings that survived are ones produced for tombs, intended to provide attractive quarters for the deceased.</p>

Painted limestone relief.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><em>Ti Watching a Hippopotamus Hunt</em></strong> was created for the tomb of Ti, a court official of the Fifth Dynasty. Intended to tell the story of Ti watching his men hunt hippopotami, <strong><em>Ti </em></strong>is represented in composite form with his weight evenly distributed on both legs, a typical Egyptian stance.</p>
<p>Hunters spear the hippos that fill the river. While Ti is not physically involved in spearing the hippopotami, his presence emphasizes his essential nature to the hunt and its success. <strong>Papyrus flowers</strong>, symbol of the marshes of Lower Egypt, are interspersed with birds and wild animals at the top of the relief. The spatial relationship of marsh plants and river, birds in flight, and animals on the ground is represented by these decorative conventions rather than the conventions of modern perspective.</p>
<h5>Hieroglyphics</h5>
<p><strong>Hieroglyphic </strong>writing was developed toward the end of the fourth millennium B.C.E. Different from cuneiform, hieroglyphs were pictures instead of simplified symbols.</p>
<p>The word “hieroglyph” comes from the Greek word for “sacred carving.” Greek scholars in the 1st century B.C.E. gave the writing this name because the examples they found were chiseled into the walls of temples and public monuments.</p>
<p>The ability to read hieroglyphics was lost until 1799 C.E., when French soldiers uncovered an unusual stone tablet in the Egyptian town of Rosetta. The stone was covered with three distinct registers of engraved lines. Scholars recognized the writing on the bottom as Greek and would use this as a reference for decoding the hieroglyphs.</p>
<p>The writing at the top—hieroglyphic writing—was a mystery. Was it to be read right to left, left to right, or vertically? By comparing text on the Rosetta Stone to hieroglyphics on temple walls and monuments, researchers discovered that a cartouche surrounding hieroglyphics indicated a name. The names of kings and queens were among the first translated.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rosetta Stone</strong></h5>

<p>Considered so valuable, the <strong>Palette of King Narmer</strong>, has never been allowed to leave Egypt. It functioned as a <strong>ritual object</strong> <strong>dedicated to Horus</strong>. Its high quality of craftsmanship makes it invaluable.</p>
<h5><strong>A Beautiful Form </strong></h5>
<p>The large work is more than two feet in height and beautifully carved, from <strong>Greywacke </strong>siltstone in a grey-green color. King Narmer is depicted within the low relief carving, as well as other symbols, with debatable meanings.</p>
<p>The elaborate scenes are depicted in <strong>low relief sculpture</strong>, set in registers or horizontal zones. The images offer a <strong>twisted perspective</strong> and a delineation of musculature.</p>
<h5><strong>On the Front</strong></h5>
<p>On the front Narmer wears a cobra crown of Lower Egypt. The Hathor or cow goddess is at the top. Narmer is proceeded by four standard bearers and a priest, followed by a sandal bearer. The serpopards, a cross between a serpent and a leopard symbolizes the unification of Egypt.  At the bottom, Narmer is a bull knocking down a city fortress.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back, Hathor is still along the top register. Hawk as the god Horus, holds a rope around a decapitated man’s head. Narmer has symbols of strength, with a bull’s tail at his waist, and wears the white crown of Upper Egypt. This crown is a symbol of the dazzling brilliance of midday sun and the nocturnal light of stars and moon. A servant holds sandals. Narmer is king/god who walks barefoot. Defeated enemies are below his feet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>In Daily Use</strong></h5>
<p>In general, palettes were part of everyday life. The function was to grind makeup and to mix eyeliner. This black substance was ringed around the eyes to prevent the glare from the sun. The design of a palette could be simple or elaborate depending on who owned it or a <strong>hierarchy of scale.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Origins and Evidence</strong></h5>
<p>Discovered at the site of Hierakonpolis, the capital of Egypt during the time, in an early temple of the falcon god Horus, it was found with ivory statues, knife handles, figurines of animals and stone vessels. It was customary to keep objects that had been dedicated to the gods and bury them to make way for new offerings.</p>
<p>This work gives evidence of a sophisticated civilization along the Nile around 3,500 BCE and the unification of Egypt (Upper – southern; Lower – northern) which was critical to future Egyptian success.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Pyramid</strong>, in <strong>Giza, Egypt</strong>, is the <strong>largest of the three was built for Khufu</strong>. It took 23 years to build and is <strong>481 feet</strong> tall and 750 feet at base length. It was constructed of 2.3 million blocks that ranged from 2.5 tons to 50 tons each.</p>
<p>The outer casings of the were made of white <strong>limestone</strong>, that would have shine in the bright sunlight.</p>
<p>At the top there would have been a <strong>gilded capstone</strong> known as a <strong>pyramidion</strong>, which reflected light, causing the pyramid to be observed from great distances.  Today, only the inner stones remain. These were roughly constructed and filled with gypsum.</p>
<p>To enter <strong>The Great Pyramid</strong>, one must crawl through a tight opening before entering the Grand Gallery.</p>

<h5>Additional Structures</h5>
<p>Smaller pyramids were built for Queens. Additionally, small rectangular structures, with flat roofs and slopping side, known as <strong>mastabas</strong> or benches, in Arabic, were part of the complex. It was an honour to be buried close to the king and therefore there was a hierarchy as to who was buried where.</p>

<p>Great Sphinx was carved <strong>in situ, meaning on site</strong> from huge rock, set in the original setting. It was originally brightly painted and is the largest carving in the world from a single stone. Great Sphinx was crafted to protects pyramids behind it, in the manner of <strong>Lamassu.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sphinx</strong> is the Greek word for a lion body, eagle wings, and a woman’s head. It is a</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid </strong>animal with the powerful man or head of pharaoh with a powerful animal,  body of lion. The lion is also a royal symbol connected to pharaohs and the sun.</p>
<h5><strong>A Place of Worship</strong></h5>
<p>Every pyramid had an adjoining <strong>mortuary temple. </strong>It was a cult of deceased kings. The dead kings became pharaohs.  Offerings were made, ceremonies performed, and cloth and food were stored here. Cult statues of pharaohs were placed inside to serve as a focus for worship.</p>

<p>In 1910, a large collection of statuary was <strong>found in Valley Temple</strong>, connected to the Pyramid of Menkaure. This <strong>joint portrait statue</strong> carved from a smooth grey stone known as <strong>greywacke </strong>and <strong>stands 4 feet 6 inches tall</strong><strong>. </strong>It is<strong> subtractive </strong>or carved out of one block of stone<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Both the king and queen are facing forward, in this <strong>sculpture in the round</strong>. Both have one foot stepping forward, and the king’s head is turned to the right slightly, suggesting movement.  They are lifelike but idealized and not realistic.</p>
<h5><strong>Perfecting Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Canon of proportion</strong> is the ideal proportions of body are based on 1 unit, a closed fist. The heel to hairline is 18 units. The knees are 5 up. The elbows are 12 up and the neck is 16 up.</p>
<h5><strong>A Woman of Mystery</strong></h5>
<p>The king is portrayed as young and lean, wearing the traditional white kilt and a pharaoh’s headdress called a nemes. Historians have suggested that because the queen is the same height as the king, and that her arms are around him in a protective way, that she is his mother and not one of his wives. Others says this could indicate her prominence or that their marital status and displays a strong, united Egypt.</p>
<p>The statue was not inscribed like others were. The face of King Menkaura is the same as others that were inscribed identifying him. Yet, the queen’s identity remains a mystery.</p>

<p><strong>Seated Scribe</strong> was found in <strong>Saqqarra</strong>, an important Old Kingdom, southwest of Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Scribe</strong>, a <strong>20-inch tall</strong>, lifelike, sculpture in the round,  representation of a scribe, seated, with legs crossed, wearing a white kilt. The medium is <strong>limestone</strong> that has been <strong>painted</strong>. Yet the nipples are made with <strong>wooden dowels.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Details</strong></h5>
<p>The eyes are made to look real, which becomes the focus of the work. Made with <strong>polished crystal</strong>, blue organic matters was added behind to keep the stone in place. It also acts as a colour for the iris. There is also an indentation representing the pupil. The eyes are etched with black eyeliner, as was the fashion of the time.</p>
<p>The artists took great care in carving the work, as scribes were considered an essential part of the community. They were the only ones who could write and therefore record history. His hands are beautifully crafted, and each nail is precise. In one hand there is a rolled piece of papyrus. In the other, there would have been a writing instrument that is no longer part of the work.</p>
<p>The focus in on the front of the sculpture, yet that is irrelevant, as it was made as s funerary sculpture.</p>
<p>The scribe in depicted in a natural way, with body fat exposed. Gods were portrayed, in a much more stylistic way.</p>
<h5><strong>A Ka Statue </strong></h5>
<p>The Ka is a human soul. Upon death, for the ka to live on, it must imbed itself in something.</p>
<p><strong>Mummification</strong> is ideal but prohibitively expensive for most people. It must look like the person, so the ka can find it.</p>
<p>Most Egyptians could not even have <strong>ka statues</strong>, for they are too expensive.</p>
<h4><strong>The New Kingdom </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Middle Kingdom ended with the invasion of Egypt by the Hyksos, who were from the Syrian and Mesopotamian uplands.</li>
<li>Introduced horses to Egypt, as well as weaponry.</li>
<li>1550 BCE: the Hyksos were expelled, and Egypt entered the period known as the New Kingdom.</li>
<li>Egypt extended borders south to Nubia.</li>
<li>Participated in trade with Asia and Aegean islands</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this vast empire wealth flowed into the land. Annual tributes were paid by conquered lands. Commercial expeditions resulted in resources including silver, good, precious stones incense and exotic animals.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly art boomed through this golden age. Such elaborate times led to legacy of ancient Egypt including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The great temples of Karnak and Luxor</li>
<li>The royal tombs of the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Kings</li>
<li>Numerous private necropolises</li>
<li>Stunning funerary objects</li>
<li>Tomb paintings</li>
<li>Relief sculpture and statuary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Famous names</strong> from this golden age include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Akhenaton</li>
<li>Thutmose</li>
<li>Hatshepsut</li>
<li>Amenhotep</li>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsut is at Metropolitan Museum in NYC</p>
<p><strong>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut </strong>was built against cliffs <strong>near Luxor, Egypt</strong>, the location was picked as a dramatic location for the architecture.  Long horizontals repeat the patterns of the cliffs behind.  Patterns of dark and light are evident in cliffs and colonnades. Organic quality of stone contrasts with the construction of the temple.</p>
<p>Carved from <strong>living rock</strong>, it is comprised or <strong>red rock and sandstone</strong>. The architecture gives it a sense of permanence and stability. It has three colonnaded terraces. A <strong>c</strong><strong>olonnade</strong> is long sequence of columns joined by their entablature. There are also <strong>porticos</strong> or shallowed columned porches.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of Hatshepsut</strong></h5>
<p>This temple was built by Senmut, Hatshepsut’s architect and lover.</p>
<p>Hatshepsut ruled Egypt for 22 years as king, even though she was female. At the time, there was no Egyptian word for queen. Just king’s wife or king’s mother. She was daughter of Thutmose I, and wife/sister of Thutmose II who died. No legitimate heir was old enough to rule. Hatshepsut took the throne over her nephew/stepson Thutmose III. She gradually increased her role of regent to that of pharaoh.</p>
<figure id="attachment_274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-274" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-274" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=400%2C724&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="724" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?w=169&amp;ssl=1 169w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=166%2C300&amp;ssl=1 166w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-274" class="wp-caption-text">Kneeling statue of Hatshepsut<br />Image © The Metropolitan Museum of<br />Art/Image source © Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>She claimed an oracle had predicted she would be pharaoh and that she was born from the gods. No knowledge of how she died or was superseded was ever found. We do know that Thutmose III destroyed many records about her after her death.</p>
<h5><strong>Worshipping the Sun God</strong></h5>
<p>This temple was built for Hatshepsut, so she could worship Amun-Rae, the sun god. Originally the gardens were planted with trees and 200 sculptures.</p>
<p>One of the sculptures that would have been in the garden was <strong><em>The Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsu</em></strong>t. The large granite sculpture shows the ruler kneeling for the sun god. An inscription on the work says she is making an offering.</p>
<p>Hatshepsut is dressed in the costume of male pharaohs, with a royal headdress and false ceremonial beard. Although she appears topless, her breasts are de-emphasized, and her shoulders are wide. To be displayed as a pharaoh meant <em>to </em>be displayed as male. She followed through with this as she wanted to convey her royal authority.</p>
<p>Today, this sculpture is on display at the Metropolitan Museum in NYC.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of Mortuary Temples</strong></h5>
<p>Temples were places kings worshipped their own patron gods. When the kings died, people would worship them there.</p>
<p>This temple was political propaganda for Hatshepsut. She wanted to  display herself as permanent and strong, while maintaining the traditions established by Narmer and carried on by Menkaure.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Rock-cut tombs were carved into the<strong> Valley of the Kings</strong> with entrances that were carefully concealed. This important canyon is where for 500 years during the time of the New Kingdom royals and nobles were buried.</p>
<p>The Valley was considered sacred to the principal feminine goddess associated with the funeral world, Nephthys. If Old Kingdom is known for pyramids, then New Kingdom is known for rock-cut tombs.</p>
<h5><strong>The Valley of the Queens </strong></h5>
<p>A new necropolis in Thebes, Egypt, during the reign of Rameses 1 (1292- 1291 BCE) was built to use for burials of royal family members. It was called The Valley of the Queens, but ancient Egyptians called it Ta Set Neferou or The Place of Beauty. The Valley of the Queens is located near the Valley of the Kings.</p>
<p>Several expeditions were carried out that revealed very little. Then, in 1903, an archeological team for the Museo Egizio, in Turin, Italy, led by Ernesto Schiaparelli, had three successful digs. The largest discovery was that of <strong>Queen Nefertari, Great Royal Wife of Ramesses II</strong>. The rock cut tomb was discovered at the base of the mountain, along with the tomb of princess Ahmose, and four of the king’s children.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1138" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PaC_Reines_Egypte_04.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1138" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PaC_Reines_Egypte_04.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" />Queen Nerfertari was the first royal spouse, hence the title and the favourite of the pharaoh. It is recorded that she could read and write hieroglyphics and was extremely educated.</p>
<p>The tombs had been plundered of most riches, back in ancient times. Yet the findings give detail to the life of queens in ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>By design alone, Nefertari&#8217;s tomb is spectacular, with relief paintings on the walls and astronomical motifs on the ceiling.</p>
<p>In Queen Nefertari tomb sarcophagus was destroyed, but pieces of the red granite lid and gilded coffin were excavated.</p>

<p>Thirty-four wooden <strong>shabtis </strong>that were once painted black were also found. A shabti is a funerary figurine, which were believed to act as servants in the afterlife, therefore the figures were made in human form. Although the queen’s shabtis were made of wood, there are examples made from clay, wax, or faience from other tombs, now in museums around the world.</p>
<p>Knobs and lids containing the name of King Ay have sparked historians to conclude that he must have been a relative to the queen.</p>
<p>The most interesting discovery was the amulet. Made from gold and blue faience, the shape is that of a djed-pillar, a sign of stability and eternal life.</p>
<p>Other expeditions from other countries involving archeological teams in the 1920’s and 1930’s revealed little more at the Valley of the Queens. Then , in 1971, The French Centre for the Study and Documentation of Ancient Egypt, went to carry out a photographic and archaeological survey. It was there they discovered the Tomb of Queen Tya, who was the wife of Set I (1290-1279) and the mother of Ramessus II.</p>
<p>Here, an interesting discovery were four canopic jars, made from limestone, with lids carved into faces. A jar with a sculpture of a human face held the queen’s liver, the baboon shaped Hapi held the lungs. The Jackal headed topper depicted Duamtef held the stomach and the jar with a falcon head Qebehseneuf held the intestines.</p>

<p>This temple in its massive form, made from <strong>cut sandstone and brick</strong> was the main religious center of the god Amun-Re, the sun god. It is in <strong>Karnark, near Luxor, Egypt</strong>. It  also held a precinct for the God Mut and Montu. One of the largest religious complexes in the world, with a <strong>main temple of 61 acres</strong>, today it is in a great state of disrepair.</p>
<p>The building has a Pylon entrance, with  two towers on a mountain with the horizon coming up between the two.</p>
<p><strong>Axial building </strong>is a building with an elongated floor plan. It was constructed from sandstone and mud brick, with  an open court or space open to the sky, supported by colonnades.</p>

<p>Early development started in the Middle Kingdom (2055- 1650 B.C.E). As the city of Thebes became more important, pharaohs began to add new developments. The main part would grow to include 20 temples, a working space for priests, kitchens, and a sacred lake.</p>
<p>Much of the stones used in construction were ripped down in ancient times. There are still notes of interest like the tallest obelisk in Egypt that was made from red granite. It was dedicated to a female pharaoh Hatshepsut who ruled during the New Kingdom.</p>
<h4><strong>Hypostyle Hall</strong></h4>
<figure id="attachment_234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-234" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hypostyle-Hall.jpg?resize=500%2C754&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="754" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Hypostyle Hall<br />© Jochem D. Wijnands/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>
<p>A hypostyle hall is a space with a roof that gains its support through columns. It was the first hall in history. The 134 columns made were from sandstone. Most of the columns are 22 feet high, except for the twelve columns in the centre are 62 feet tall. This allows for <strong>clerestory lighting</strong> or light to filter in from outside. Illumination before electricity!</p>
<p>Columns had smooth shafts, that were used to decorate and were brightly painted, with two different <strong>capitals, </strong>both bud and flower shaped<strong>.  </strong>Columns in <strong>Hypostyle Hall</strong> represent the dense clusters of reeds of the Nile, decorated like lotus, papyrus, and palm plants. Statues of gods and kings stood amongst the hypostyle columns.</p>
<p>The hall has a<strong> corridor axis </strong>or central path that runs down the temple. A rear sanctuary included a side room and central shrine.</p>
<h5><strong>More Interior Art with a Theme</strong></h5>
<p>Relief carvings occur all over the site. The theme carries the same message.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pharaohs possessed divinely granted power to maintain order on earth.</li>
<li>Pharaohs were pious and dutiful worshippers of gods.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Display of Status</strong></h5>
<p>Ordinary people could only go as far as the interior courtyard and could not even get to hypostyle hall. Egyptian priests and royalty were the only ones who could go beyond.</p>
<h5><strong>Lightness and Darkness</strong></h5>
<p>The space progressively dimmed from the courtyard, to shadowed hypostyle hall, to a darkened central shrine. This symbolized the belief that the deities reside in darkness. This was known to be both magical and mysterious.</p>
<h5><strong>Egyptian Beliefs</strong></h5>
<p>Every year yearly, a 27-day festival was held. Egyptians believed the gods could become exhausted and needed to be replenished.</p>
<p>It was believed that temples were the gods’ home on earth. Visiting a temple was the equivalent of being in the home of the divine presence. Since the gods were alive, they were given, food, drink, incense, and oils daily.</p>
<h4><strong>Amarna Period: </strong><strong>1352- 1336 BCE</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, later known as Akhenaton, abandoned the worship of most of the Egyptian gods in favor of Aton, whom he declared to be the universal and only god, identified with the sun. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Akhenaton is Aton’s representative on earth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The shift in religious focus imposed by Akhenaton introduced profound but short-lived changes into Egyptian art.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This represents the only major break in the continuity of Egyptian art.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In sculpture and painting, the traditional rules of proportion were abandoned, and a more expressive intimacy replaced the earlier stiffness and formality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amana was used as the new capital.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em></strong> is a sunken relief, <strong>limestone</strong> carving, that is <strong>one foot tall</strong>, would have been a private alter in a domestic home.</p>
<p>The pharaoh sits holding one of their daughters, with Queen Nefertiti beside him.  Two of their daughters sit with her, one of her left and the other on her right shoulder. It is a domestic scene of informality.</p>
<p>All have stylized swollen bellies, long thin arms, and elongated heads. a traditional composite view of the body with <strong>twisted perspective</strong>. The children are nude with shaved heads which were the custom of the time.</p>
<h5><strong>Androgyny</strong></h5>
<p>The bodies exhibit an <strong>androgyny</strong> of indeterminate gender. Many historians believe Aton, or sun, who they worshipped, was believed to be both male and female. If  Akhenaton was the son of the sun, then he would be dominated by both genders.</p>
<p>This distinguished new art from Egypt’s past.</p>
<h5><strong>The Chosen Couple</strong></h5>
<p>Above them the rays of God Aten shine down. A cobra is embedded in the sunshine symbolizing that Aten is the one true God.  The sun’s rays end in <strong>ankhs</strong>, that give the king and queen the breath of life. The queen’s throne is decorated with lotus flowers, which symbolizes the unification of Egypt. <strong>Hieroglyphics</strong> on the top and around the figures explain the worship to Aton.</p>
<h5><strong>Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>This work signifies a style break in art, as Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten, who ruled from 1353- 1336 BCE changed the religion and started to worship God Aten.</p>
<p>Pharaoh Amenhotep IV abandoned the worship of the Egyptian gods in favor of Aton, whom he declared to be universal and only god, identified with the sun.  He changed his name to be Akhenaton (“Aton is pleased”). He had the names and images of other gods from temples defaced.</p>
<p>There were no priests  in this new religion. Akhenaton was Aten’s son and his representative on earth.</p>
<h5><strong>Analysis and Comparison of  <em>Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em> and <em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em></strong> is a bas-relief carving in limestone measuring 32.5 cm in height and depicting King Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti holding their three young daughters. It was created in the 18th dynasty in Ancient Egypt, around 1350 BCE.</p>
<p>The bas relief is representative for <strong>Amarna period</strong> in which royalty and the solar divinity Aten are closely connected. This breaks with a three thousand of years of consistent art representation, by making the pharaoh and his family the only ones favored by the new god Aten.</p>
<p>The artifact is intended to be <strong>part of a household altar</strong>, and so it <strong>had both religious and decorative purposes</strong>.</p>
<p>The adult figures are presented in a <strong>composite view</strong> (profile view of the face, but the shoulders face the viewer exposing more of the body) , which is typical of Ancient Egyptian carvings, and they sit on low stools facing each other, which emphasizes their close marriage relationship. The inclusion of the three daughters <strong>signifies the importance of family</strong>, not just for the continuation of royal lineage, but also in the context of the Egyptian home where the altar would have been used.</p>
<p>The image is distinctive not only because it represents <strong>a shift from polytheism to the monotheistic worship of the sun god Aten</strong>, but mainly because it is informal. The pharaoh Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti seem to be captured playing with their children. The pharaoh supports his daughter head almost ready to kiss/hug her, while she points to her mother the queen, who at her turn holds two of her sisters. One is pointing to the pharaoh and one playing with her mother earring.</p>
<p>The anatomy of the <strong>pharaoh with a slight belly</strong> is a departure from the perfect anatomy of the Egyptian classical representation. The anatomy of the three daughters  with their <strong>round bellies, elongated heads</strong> <strong>and members</strong> is also a departure from the rectilinear classical forms associated with the old religion of Amon.</p>
<p>The <strong>iconography</strong> shows the sun disk with a cobra inside as a symbol of only one god replacing the entire Egyptian pantheon. The central position of the sun highlights the supreme importance of Aten, and its rays offer the royal family ankh signs, which signify life (Egyptian Museum Berlin, 1), while offering only hands in rest.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the symbols of both Lower and Upper Egypt  are not placed on the pharaoh, but under Nefertiti’s chair symbolizing that she is queen of both and that <strong>the couple ruled together</strong>. After the death of Nefertiti the religion returned to the cult of Amon. Images dating from the Amarna period were destroyed. This limestone piece is a survivor.</p>
<p>The encaustic icon of  <strong><em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong> is a painting dating from dates from the sixth or early seventh century CE of the Byzantine Empire. Situated in St. Catherine&#8217;s Monastery, Sinai, Egypt, this Byzantine icon uses wax as a medium to carry the color and it is one earliest surviving images of the Theotokos, i.e. “Mother of God”, an image that dominated Byzantine art and influenced the cult of the Virgin in both Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-527" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/54-Virgin-Theotokos-and-Child.jpg?resize=506%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="506" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/54-Virgin-Theotokos-and-Child.jpg?w=218&amp;ssl=1 218w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/54-Virgin-Theotokos-and-Child.jpg?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The icons were images which served as a devotional aid, focusing the attention of Christians on the key relationships between G-d and human beings. The values that are highlighted here are: a hierarchical world view in which G-d is omnipotent, served by angels who worship him, Mary who brings to the world the Messia in the form of the infant Jesus, saints who assist her and the infant Jesus. Such images of Christ and Marie were controversial in the Byzantine Empire, theologists being concerned that the people venerated the images and not G-d.</p>
<p>In the 8th century the emperor Leo the II the Syrian forbade the use of icons. During this period icons were destroyed by the iconoclasts, “icon breakers”, so this icon is a survivor similarly, to the <strong><em>Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em></strong>.  The resemblance between  the two images continues at a symbolic level.</p>
<p><strong><em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong> is also an image centered the figure of  G-d of a monotheistic religion, the Christian one. While Christ is also placed centrally in the arms of Saint Mary, G-d  is symbolically represented by a hand situated at the top and centre of the image, radiating out to the rest of the picture. The mother and child take a lower position, and all characters have haloes, i.e. golden circles of light around their heads, which denotes their holy status. Mary, the archetypal mother, sits on a golden throne, holding her child, which hints at a queenly role for her, and kingship for him, albeit of a spiritual kind. The crosses held by the two male saints are another symbol, representing the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The image is far away from the natural representation of the pharaoh’s family.  The eyes of the saints and of Mary are piercing, but  they do not make eye contact between themselves or with the viewer. Theodore and George gaze forward beyond the viewer, and Mary looks slightly down as if they were preoccupied by something else. The bluish, nearly transparent angels in the third row turn their heads towards G-d. The light emanating from G-d ends on Mary’s halo reminding the viewer that Christ was the incarnation of G-d through Mary. Only the angels seem to make eye contact with the onlooker in agreement with their religious role of intercessors on behalf of the believer.</p>
<p>Both artifacts <strong>act as a bridge between the human and the divine</strong> in their respective cultures. Both <strong>show a single deity</strong> through abstract and symbolic means, and they have rather flat, two-dimensional human figures. The arrangement of figures from top to bottom underlines the order of the cosmos in each society, while eye contact of the angels  draws the viewer in <strong><em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong> much more than in the earlier <strong><em>Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em></strong> to suggest a more direct relationship with G-d, while the leisure pose of  <strong><em>Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em></strong> suggests a joyful religion with less restrictions on its believers.</p>

<p>Tutankhamun’s coffin has always been a showstopping piece of art. The inner most <strong>gold coffin</strong> measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches and weighs 243 pounds</strong>. It has been carved using incisions and is <strong>inlaid with</strong> two types of semi precious stones&#8211; <strong>lapis lazuli and turquoise</strong>.</p>
<p>It also contains <strong>enamel</strong> work. Melted and fused glass powder is fused with pigment to create colour, then smoothed once cooled.</p>
<h5><strong>The Role of the Sarcophagus</strong></h5>
<p>This sarcophagus was made not only to protect the body, but to enable unification with ka. The great expense it took to create this work, was a display of status and prestige.</p>
<p>The bright colouring indicated a better life in the after world. Special symbols were included to help the body ward off spirits. Holding the crook and flail was a pharaonic symbol of power.</p>
<p>Nut, the sky goddess wrapped her wings around the mummy as protection.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was King Tut?</strong></h5>
<p>King Tut was Akhenaton’s son with his sister. He was a sickly child and died by the age of 18, but not before marrying his sister. His tomb was small, which leaves historians to assume that his death was sudden and unexpected. With his brief life he was a minor figure in Egyptian history.</p>
<p>King Tut did manage to accomplish a few things in his short time frame. He overturned his father’s interest in the Amarna art and worship of Aten. He restored Egyptian religion to polytheism and Egyptian art to traditional styles.</p>
<p>His name, TutankhAMUN, is a reference to restoring power to the old god Amun.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was King Tut and his tomb so famous?</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-316" style="width: 449px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-316" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/King-Tut-Discovery.jpg?resize=449%2C376&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="449" height="376" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/King-Tut-Discovery.jpg?w=449&amp;ssl=1 449w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/King-Tut-Discovery.jpg?resize=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-316" class="wp-caption-text">Discovery of King Tut</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was the only royal tomb untouched, until it was discovered by British Howard Carter, in 1922. There is a curse associated with the tomb, with many stories about people who were in mysterious accidents or died after encountering it.</p>
<p>In January 2015, the funerary mask was damaged in cleaning. The beard was knocked off and restorationist epoxied it back on in a messy fashion.</p>
<h5><strong>The Multiple Stage of Mummification</strong></h5>
<p>For Egyptians to enter the afterlife, it was believed that their bodies had to remain preserved, so they  would later be able to walk around. Sand caused a great deal or decay to bodies, so preservation required many intricate steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong></p>
<p>Priests, who were the embalmers set the body upon a large table that look very much like a lab table today. Here, in only a room in which they were allowed, the priests performed various gesture and incantations over the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>The body was then washed with a mineral powder made with hydrated sodium carbonate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>This is when the extraction of the brain would incur, by using a metal hook, inserted through the nostrils.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong></p>
<p>Incisions were made to extract the organs including the kidney, lungs, large blood vessels and esophagus. These were stored in jars, after being washed in scented water, and wrapped in cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<p>The body was filled internally with myrrh and natron which was wrapped in linen. Then the remains of the body were set under a mound of natron for 70 days. This would dry out the body and give the skin a look of leather.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
<p>The body was then washed and moisturized with scented oils and fats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
<p>The mouth needed to speak to plead its case and enter the afterlife. It was treated with a mix of hot wax, myrrh, and terebinth.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
<p>Since the eye had not been extracted, they remain in a dried form. New eyes were made from various constructions to be placed in front of the original eyes. Materials used included precious metals, ceramics, or enamel, with a pupil drawn in with kohl.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9 </strong></p>
<p>The body was then wrapped in strips of linen that was covered in a resin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10</strong></p>
<p>The head was given a mask that was made from cedar, gilded stucco or pure gold.</p>

<p>This work <strong>painted on papyrus scroll</strong> is from the <em>Book of the Dead</em>. It was found inside <strong>Hu-Nefer’s tomb</strong> and measures <strong>11 by 17 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Reading this Work</strong></h5>
<p>It reads from left to right and functioned as a type of witness statement to the character of the deceased. Originally, this type of work was placed only in the tomb of dead kings, but later those of high rank were also included. In this case, it was for a scribe, that because of the profession’s talent in writing, were given a priestly status.</p>
<p>It depicts a scene of judgement complete with text and pictorial images. Only those with good ethnics were deemed worthy to go into the afterlife. These images include gods and deities, and symbols of the afterlife such as lotus flowers and anks.</p>
<p>There is a formality of stance, with traditional shapes of bodies, and a twisted perspective. The text functions around the images and acts as a caption explaining the theme.</p>
<h5><strong>Created for Hu-Nefer</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created especially for the patron <strong>Hu-Nefer, </strong><strong>was a royal scribe to Seti</strong>.  He holds the hand of Anubis, the god of embalming with a jackal’s head, who leads him into a hall where his hands are being weighed against a feather. If his soul is heavier than a feather, he would be sent to the underworld. Here Ammit, the hippo/lion/crocodile eats the soul of the dead.</p>
<p>The god Thoth, with the head of an ibis bird, records who gets to move forward in the book of life.  The god Horus, with the head of a falcon, presents Hu-Nefer to Osiris, the god of the underworld, who is enthroned on the right. At the top, Hu-Nefer pleads his case to 42 judges. This is artistically simplified to 14.</p>
<h5><strong>Book of the Dead : </strong><strong>Egyptian Funerary Rituals</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>Following is an excerpt and image from <strong><em>The Book of the Dead</em></strong>: &#8220;I have traveled through the tomb, dark and lonely ground. I am here now. I have come. I see. In the underworld, I embraced my father. I have burned away his darkness. I am his beloved. I have killed the snake. I have given him meat. I walk in my sleep through earth and heaven.”</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>How are the quote and the artwork related?</strong></h5>
<p>Using specific visual and contextual evidence while referencing both the quote and the work shown, let’s analyze how both the quote and the artwork reflect the Egyptian views of death and afterlife.</p>
<p>The quote suggests that the journey of the soul towards Osiris was not straightforward. Demonic crocodiles, snakes could trick or attack the soul in the underworld. Even while trying to save his own soul, the scribe continued to perform good deeds and protect his father.</p>
<p>The quote illustrates how <strong><em>The Book of Dead</em></strong> prepared the deceased for what awaited him/her in the Underworld, providing the soul with the spells driving away the dangers. The elaborated <strong>texts and illustrations </strong>complement each other and allow us to better understand the beliefs of the ancient Egyptian civilization.</p>
<p>The artwork depicts the main hurdle a deceased person must overcome, for example the weighing of the heart. In the Hall of Truth, the deceased is judged by a court chaired by <strong>Osiris</strong>, whose life-giving power/rebirth associated with the Nile River. Before the 42 god who asses his life a crouched Hu-Nefer allegedly describes his good life.</p>
<p>The judgment begins with the reception of the deceased by <strong>jackal-headed god Anubis</strong>. Anubis holds in his hand an <strong>ankh</strong> the symbol of the eternal life that might be awarded to Hu-Nefer. In the center stands the scale having on a tray, the heart of the deceased, and a feather on the other. If the heart is pure, the balance remains in balance and the deceased can access the paradise. The feather belongs to the goddess of order Maat who appears at the top of the scale.</p>
<p>Around the scales are represented the gods <strong>Anubis and Thoth</strong>. God of the scribes, the latter notes the results of the weighing. A strange monster with a crocodile head, lion paws and hippopotamus hindquarters called <strong>&#8220;the devourer&#8221;</strong> also appears near the scales ready to devour the heart of Hu-Nefer?</p>
<p>After the Judgement, the ankh is passed to <strong>Horus the falcon-headed god</strong>, who introduces Hu-Nefer in another room in which sits Horus’ father, <strong>Osiris.</strong> The most important god of the Egyptian pantheon Osiris is enthroned, sits on a throne surrounded by <strong>Isis and Nephthys</strong>.</p>
<p>In front of Osiris blooms a lotus flower the symbol of eternal life on which stay the children of Horus who are depicted on all canonic jars carrying the organs of a deceased.</p>
<p>The text and the artwork show that both chaos and order determined a soul journey through afterlife and that one needed to both live an ethical life and to educate himself/ herself in order to gain eternal life.</p>

<p>An Egyptian stela was considered religious but also had magical properties. Made from limestone or wood, they were carved, painted, or sometimes both. A stela was most commonly found in two places: inside a tomb, or inside a funerary chapel so loved ones could honor the dead.  On a stela the deceased was represented in a pictorial image, usually in front of an offering table full of food, with their names and any titles included.</p>
<p>During the time of the Old Kingdom, a stela was a rectangular shape that stood horizontally. Later, they were placed vertically, and it became fashionable to have a rounded top.</p>
<p>The example above is from Museo Egizio, in Turin, Italy. Made from sandstone, the object stands 100 by 63 by 15 centimetres. It was made for a craftman named Naki and it is thought to be from the region of Deir el-Medina, which was well regarded for their artistry.</p>
<h5><strong>How to Read An Egyptian Stela</strong></h5>
<p>A stela is set up in registers with each depicting a different scene.</p>
<h5><strong>The Top Register</strong></h5>
<p>On the top left with the jackal head is the god Anubis. Notice the ankh he is holding. This will assist in guiding the deceased to the afterlife. Just in front sits Osiris the ruler of the Netherworld. He is the symbol of rebirth, as the first said to have risen after being killed by his brother. See how the hieroglyphics tell the story above each character. Nakhi stands in front of a table with offerings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Center and Bottom Register </strong></h5>
<p>Nakhi and his wife are sitting together. The large cones on their head are perfume cones and are considered a sign of status.  On the table in front are items the deceased will require. The many children line up to give symbols of resurrection to their parents.</p>

New Kingdom @ Metroplitan Museum of Art.</figcaption></figure>
<h5><strong>Upon Further  Reflection</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mirrors</strong> were made from bronze, copper, and silver, but did not contain glass. This would not appear until Roman times.  The metal provided the reflection.  The handles were decorative and would often contain images of Hathor the goddess of love and beauty.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror with Handle in the Form of a Hathor Emblemca</strong> from 1479–1425 B.C. at the Metropolitan Museum of art in New York, is a fine example of a mirror in ancient Egypt, New Kingdom. Originally made of wood, It was <strong>covered in gold foil</strong>. The use of precious metals indicates it was for the elite. It has been traced back to Thutmose II belonging to one of his three wives.</p>
<p>The woman face on the top of the handle has the large ears of a cow. This represents the goddess Bat, but is also a symbol for Hathor.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face with cow&#8217;s ears represents the goddess Bat and is also an emblem of the goddess Hathor. The use of gold and silver, rather than wood and bronze, identifies this as the possession of a member of the elite, in this case one of three foreign wives of Thutmose III. The king&#8217;s cartouche is inscribed above the face.</p>
<h5><strong>Time To Make Up</strong></h5>
<p>Small stone vessels were the perfect storage space for <strong>face washing creams and moisturizers</strong>. These beauty essential skin softeners were made from a combination of vegetable oils and animal fat along with fragrances.</p>
<p>The Smith papyrus has a recipe for a face cream using the main ingredient fenugreek.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know that both men and women used foundations in the form of powder?</strong> It was used on both the face and body to whiten them. The predominate ingredient was ceruse. Foundations or base makeups were stored in round stone jars.</p>
<p><strong>Kohl or black eyeliner</strong> was stored in long tubes (After it was ground and mixed on a palette!) Often made of reed and wood, glass containers were reserved for the elite. There are only 500 glass kohl containers known in existence. <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1086" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Container-for-Kohl.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Eyeliner helped to define the eye. Due to its antibacterial functions, it also prevented infections, which were common due to sand, the drying elements of the air and the beating sun.</p>
<p>Long deep spoons were used to store various <strong>coloured blush powders</strong>. Examples of spoon materials found include wood or ivory. The handles were often carved into elongated images. Naked swimmers, ducks or water lilies were popular choices.</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a spoon<strong>. </strong><strong>Cosmetic Spoon in the Shape of Swimming Woman Holding a Dish</strong> 1390–1352 BCE (New Kingdom)  The object is made from Travertine (Egyptian alabaster) and steatite. The top once held a container for blush. A  swimming woman on the handle holds on to an antelope. The entire work is almost 9 inches long.</p>

<h5><strong>Hair Care</strong></h5>
<p>Hair was an important part of beauty in ancient Egypt. Abundance was key and it was often enhanced with hair extensions and wigs. These pieces were made from wool or human hair.</p>
<p>Henna was used to dye hair. This was obtained from the leaves of a thorny shrub from the lythraceae family.</p>
<p>For adornment, hair accessories such as combs, or flowers like the popular lotus were added.</p>
<h5><strong>The Importance of Beauty in the Afterlife</strong></h5>
<p>Objects of beauty that aided in beautification were buried in tombs the accompany souls in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Here is an example. <strong>The Wide-Necked Cosmetic Jar</strong> was created between 1550-1450 BCE (New Kingdom) When this piece was excavated it also contained a hairpin and a wooden kohl stick to apply eyeliner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Ancient Mediterranean Art</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>3500 BCE- 300 BCE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-220" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=600%2C760&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="760" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?w=273&amp;ssl=1 273w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 2.4 </strong><strong>Theories and Interpretations of Ancient Mediterranean Art </strong></h5>
<p>The study of art history is shaped by different theories and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated, and adapted to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Gathering Contextual Information</strong></h5>
<p>Contextual information for Ancient Greek and Roman art can be derived from contemporary literary, political, legal, and economic records, as well as from archaeological excavations conducted from the mid-18th century onward.  Etruscan art, by contrast, is illuminated primarily by modern archaeological record and by descriptions of contemporary external observers.</p>
<h5><strong>Categorizing Ancient Mediterranean Art </strong></h5>
<p>The arts of these early western artistic cultures are generally studied chronologically. Additionally, archaeological models and stylistic analysis have identified periods based on stylistic changes. Artworks are assigned to periods according to styles, for example archaic Greek. It may also be categorized by governments, or dynasties such as the Roman Republic. This is also dependent on the available technology, and the availability of evidence.</p>
<h5><strong>A Foundation for Later Development</strong></h5>
<p>Ancient Greek and Roman art provided the foundation for the later development of European and Mediterranean artistic traditions. From the 18th century onward, European, and American observers admired ancient Greek and Roman ethical and governmental systems.  This contributed to prioritizing art and architecture that could be associated with political elites and cultural capitals, for example Rome. More recently, art historians have examined art produced by contemporary subjects or “provincial” populations.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest written statements about artists and art making survive from the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. Little survives of the rich Etruscan literary tradition that is documented in Roman sources.</p>

<h4><strong>(2) 31. Temple of Minerva and sculpture of Apollo  </strong></h4>
<p>Temple of Minerva (elevation and plan). Master sculptor Vulca. Etruscan. 510-500 BCE. Etruscan.</p>
<figure id="attachment_296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-296" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-296" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Temple-of-Minerva-Plan.png?resize=450%2C538&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="450" height="538" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-296" class="wp-caption-text">Temple of Minerva plan</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>, in <strong>Veii, near Rome, Italy</strong>, was made from <strong>mudbrick</strong> and <strong>wood</strong>. Therefore, over the many years,  the structure has vanished.</p>
<p>We know what it would have looked like thanks to Roman architect Vitruvius who wrote the book <em>De architectura, </em>a book about Etruscan temples in the late first century BCE.</p>
<p>The temple measured <strong>50 by 70 feet</strong> and was elevated on a raised platform like a stylobate. The stone foundation was made from a material called <strong>tufa, </strong>a porous limestone.</p>
<figure id="attachment_297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-297" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-297" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Temple-of-Minerva-elevation.png?resize=500%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="351" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Temple-of-Minerva-elevation.png?w=390&amp;ssl=1 390w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Temple-of-Minerva-elevation.png?resize=300%2C211&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-297" class="wp-caption-text">Temple of Minerva elevation</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steps in front direct your attention to the porch, with only one defined entrance in the front. It was not meant to be seen from the back or sides.</p>
<p>The influence of Greek architecture is evident in the pediment/columns. These <strong>Tuscan columns</strong> are Doric with a base, unfluted, made from wood and spaced widely apart. Once these columns had been painted to be both colourful and ornate.</p>
<p><strong>Acroteria, or roof sculptures</strong> sat on the tops of Etruscan temples, unlike Greek architecture, where these figures would be in the pediment.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dedication to Minerva</strong></h5>
<p>This temple was a dedication to Minerva (Athena) patron goddess of heroic endeavors. It was a place not only of worship, but community and gatherings.</p>
<p>The back portion of the building was divided into three separate rooms or <strong>triple cellas</strong>, known as a <strong>divine triad</strong>.  These were dedicated to Athena (Minerva), Zeus ( Jupiter) and Hera (Juno).</p>
<h5><strong>Terra Cotta Sculptural Remains</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-298" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-298" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Minerva.png?resize=500%2C724&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="724" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Minerva.png?resize=707%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 707w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Minerva.png?resize=207%2C300&amp;ssl=1 207w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Minerva.png?resize=768%2C1112&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Minerva.png?w=802&amp;ssl=1 802w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-298" class="wp-caption-text">Apollo<br />© Scala/Ministero per i Beni e le Attività culturali/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Several terra cotta sculptures remain from the <strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>. The most prized is the <strong>Sculpture of Apollo </strong>standing at<strong> 5 feet and 11 inches</strong>. This<strong> acroterion </strong>roof sculpture was painted. It has the<strong> Archaic smile</strong> that Etruscan figures tend to present as excitement and happiness. The hair is braided as is common. Apollo is stepping forward, but there is no movement in the upper body.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Vulca?</strong></h5>
<p>Etruscan art is almost always anonymous. However, literature gives us a clue as to who created the pieces found at the <strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>. Roman writer Pliny wrote that in the late 6th century BCE, an <strong>Etruscan artist by the name of Vulca</strong> was summoned from Veii to Rome, with a request to decorate the most important temple there, the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.</p>
<p>This was a large-scale commission that required the work of a master. Art historians believe that these skills may have landed Vulca the commission at <strong>Temple of Minerva</strong>.</p>
<p>Today the <strong>Sculpture of Apollo</strong> resides at the <strong>Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia</strong>, in Rome.</p>

<h4><strong>(2) 37. Winged Victory of Samothrace. </strong></h4>
<p>Greek. 190 BCE.  Greek (Hellenistic)</p>
<figure id="attachment_299" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-299" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-299" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Winged-Victory-of-Samothrace.jpg?resize=750%2C1052&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="1052" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Winged-Victory-of-Samothrace.jpg?w=236&amp;ssl=1 236w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Winged-Victory-of-Samothrace.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-299" class="wp-caption-text">Winged Victory of Samothrace<br />© RMN-Grand Palais/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Hellenistic female sculpture</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Commemoration<br />
Deities<br />
Victory<br />
Religious complex</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Louvre, Paris</p>
<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong> is a deeply carved figure of <strong>marble</strong>, standing a monumental <strong>9 feet tall</strong>. It is work full of energy, with a display of movement. Note the dramatic twist and <strong>contrapposto</strong> of the figure. The <strong>wet drapery</strong> imitates the look of water upon the body.</p>
<p><strong>Found on the island of Samothrace</strong> in a sanctuary in a harbor, she faces the way that the wind typically blows, which explains the flutter of the drapery.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong> was built to commemorate a naval victory by the Greeks. Which battle remains unclear, but many scholars point to the Battle of Cos between Macedonians and Egyptians</p>
<h5><strong>Nike the Goddess of Victory</strong></h5>
<p>This work was meant to sit on a fountain, as a figurehead on a boat. The fountain would splash water on the figure as if the waves were dashing up against the ship. The statue would have reflected off the water, giving it a sense of movement.</p>
<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace</strong>, is the messenger goddess of victory, <strong>Nike</strong>. Her missing right arm may have raised a victory crown or been held up in greeting. A fragment found in 1948 seems to be from this statue and indicates her arm was raised.</p>
<p>Her clothing is pulled tightly across her abdomen and left leg. It bunches up in thick layers around her front right leg. This makes the figure seems to be alive and breathing. The work is intensely emotive.</p>
<h5><strong>A Backgrounder on Hellenism</strong></h5>
<p>Hellenism began after the death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE). At this point, the strain and change in Greek life prompted artists to explore a wider range of emotion. This was most apparent in sculpture. These new works had a greater variety of expression through motion, movement, and energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Ancient Mediterranean Art</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>3500 BCE- 300 BCE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-220" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=650%2C824&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="650" height="824" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?w=273&amp;ssl=1 273w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>TOPIC 2.3  </strong><strong>Purpose and Audience in Ancient Mediterranean Art</strong></h4>
<p>A variety of purposes may affect art and art making.  Some examples include audience, patron, artistic intention, and/ or function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or intended audience.</p>
<p>In <strong>Near East and dynastic Egypt</strong> these functions sometimes changed overtime, ultimately affecting the art and artist traditions, that were focused on representing royal figures and divinities.  This also applied to the function of <strong>funerary and palatial complexes</strong> within their cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Architectural representations include towering ziggurats that provide monumental settings for the worship of many deities, as well as heavily fortified palaces that increased in opulence over the centuries. All were to proclaim the power and authority of rulers.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Ka Statue? </strong></h5>
<p>A ka statue is a statue to house the ka, or the spirit, after death. It is part of the culture of dynastic Egypt, represented by an elaborate funerary sect. The devotees created numerous ka statues, as well as artifacts, decorations, and furnishings for tombs.</p>
<h5><strong>The Basis of Art from Ancient Greece and Rome</strong></h5>
<p>The art of <strong>Ancient Greece and Rome</strong> is grounded in <strong>civic ideals</strong> and <strong>polytheism</strong>. <strong>Etruscan and ancient Roman </strong>art express <strong>republican and imperial values, power</strong>, and preference for <strong>conspicuous display</strong>. Etruscan and Roman architecture are characterized by investment in <strong>public structure</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>(2) 19. The Code of Hammurabi </strong></h4>
<p>Babylonian (Susian). Basalt. 1,792-1,750 BCE. Babylon (Susa, Iran). Mesopotamian (Babylonian).</p>
<figure id="attachment_272" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-272" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-272" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg?resize=300%2C692&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="692" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg?resize=130%2C300&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg?w=144&amp;ssl=1 144w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-272" class="wp-caption-text">The Code of Hammurabi © The Gallery Collection/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Learning Objective</strong>: Mesopotamian law code</p>
<p><strong>Themes: </strong></p>
<p>Appropriation<br />
Rulers<br />
Status<br />
Power<br />
Text and image<br />
Community<br />
Commemoration</p>
<p><strong>Museum: </strong>Louvre</p>
<p>Once again, this work is a <strong>stele</strong> or a stone slab to mark a gravesite, standing <strong>7 feet 6 inches tall</strong>. At the top it is a <strong>relief sculpture,</strong> and this is a sample of <strong>low relief</strong>. It has <strong>incised/intaglio</strong> text that is carved into the material. The figures show a <strong>twisted perspective</strong>, in that they are viewed in profile, with the shoulders facing forward. This work also shows a <strong>hierarchy of scale</strong>. The seated figure (god) would be displayed as the taller figure if standing.</p>
<h5><strong>Images Up Close</strong></h5>
<p>This one is representational of the law and designed in three sections.</p>
<p>At the top is a carved relief of King Hammurabi on the left, who ruled Babylonia from 1792-1750 BCE.</p>
<p>To the right is Shamash, the sun god and god of justice, indicated by the horned crown on his head and the beams of divine light radiating from his shoulders. The god is seated on a temple throne or <strong>ziggurat</strong> that is perched upon mountains. He is gifting the king with a rope, rod, and ring, as a sign of power. Hammurabi on the left is speaking in greeting, while gesturing. He stands respectfully in front of Shamash.</p>
<h5><strong>The Text</strong></h5>
<p>There are three passages. The first is the justification of Hammurabi as king as well as a glorification.  Below this is a section of 300 laws, inscribed in <strong>cuneiform script</strong>, in the <strong>Akkadian language</strong>. This determines the result of any wrong actions, which has already been established through legal precedence.</p>
<p>For example, it says:</p>
<p><em>If a man builds a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls and kills its owner, then the builder shall be put to death. </em></p>
<p>The third section of text is a poem praising Hammurabi’s virtues.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of The Code of Hammurabi </strong></h5>
<p>This work was crafted to ensure that the laws were known to the public. It includes images, as the literacy rate was extremely low in ancient civilizations. These laws give a sense in history to what was important in Babylonian laws.</p>
<p>It also glorified Hammurabi, as a pious and obedient ruler. The poem on the stele makes it clear that he is responsible for bringing the law to the people.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This work is the <strong>earliest law code ever written</strong> and likely predates the Old Testament commandments. It was exhibited at the city of Sippar in the Babylonian kingdom, with  multiple copies placed around the kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsut is at Metropolitan Museum in NYC</p>
<p><strong>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut </strong>was built against cliffs <strong>near Luxor, Egypt</strong>, the location was picked as a dramatic backdrop for the architecture.  Long horizontals repeat the patterns of the cliffs behind.  Patterns of dark and light are evident in the cliffs and colonnades. The organic quality of stone contrasts with the construction of the temple.</p>
<p>Carved from <strong>living rock</strong>, it is comprised of <strong>red rock and sandstone</strong>. The architecture gives it a sense of permanence and stability. It has three colonnaded terraces. A <strong>c</strong><strong>olonnade</strong> is a long sequence of columns joined by their <strong>entablature</strong>. <strong>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut</strong> also has <strong>porticos</strong> or shallowed columned porches.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of Hatshepsut</strong></h5>
<p>This temple was built by Senmut, Hatshepsut’s architect and lover.</p>
<p>Hatshepsut ruled Egypt for 22 years as king, even though she was female. At the time, there was no Egyptian word for queen&#8211;just king’s wife or king’s mother. She was daughter of Thutmose I, and wife/sister of Thutmose II who died. No legitimate heir was old enough to rule.</p>
<p>Hatshepsut took the throne over her nephew/stepson Thutmose III. She gradually increased her role of regent to that of pharaoh.</p>
<p>She claimed an oracle had predicted she would be pharaoh and that she was born from the gods. No knowledge of how she died or was superseded was ever uncovered. We do know that Thutmose III destroyed many records about her after her death.</p>
<h5><strong>Worshipping the Sun God</strong></h5>
<p>This temple was built for Hatshepsut, so she could worship Amun-Rae, the sun god. Originally the gardens were planted with trees and 200 sculptures.</p>
<p>One of the sculptures that would have been in the garden was <strong><em>The Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsu</em></strong>t. The large granite sculpture shows the ruler kneeling for the sun god. An inscription on the work says she is making an offering.</p>
<figure id="attachment_274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-274" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-274" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=350%2C634&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="350" height="634" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?w=169&amp;ssl=1 169w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=166%2C300&amp;ssl=1 166w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-274" class="wp-caption-text">Kneeling statue of Hatshepsut<br />Image © The Metropolitan Museum of<br />Art/Image source © Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hatshepsut is dressed in the costume of male pharaohs, with a royal headdress and false ceremonial beard. Although she appears topless, her breasts are de-emphasized, and her shoulders are wide. To be displayed as a pharaoh meant to be displayed as male. She followed through with this as she wanted to convey her royal authority.</p>
<p>Today, this sculpture is on display at the Metropolitan Museum in NYC.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of Mortuary Temples</strong></h5>
<p>Temples were places kings worshipped their own patron gods while they are still alive. When the kings died, people would worship them there.</p>
<p>This temple was political propaganda for Hatshepsut. She wanted to  display herself as permanent and strong, while maintaining the traditions established by Narmer and carried on by Menkaure.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Rock-cut tombs were carved into the Valley of the Kings with entrances that were carefully concealed. This important canyon is where for 500 years during the time of the New Kingdom royals and nobles were buried.</p>
<p>The Valley was considered sacred to the principal feminine goddess associated with the funeral world, Nephthys. If Old Kingdom is known for pyramids, then New Kingdom is known for rock-cut tombs.</p>

<p>Tutankhamun’s coffin has always been a showstopping piece of art. The inner most <strong>gold coffin</strong> measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches and weighs 243 pounds</strong>. It has been <strong>carved </strong>using incisions and is <strong>inlaid</strong> with two types of semi precious stones&#8211; <strong>lapis lazuli and turquoise</strong>.</p>
<p>It also contains <strong>enamel work</strong>. Melted and fused glass powder is them mixed with pigment to create colour, then smoothed once cooled.</p>
<h5><strong>The Role of the Sarcophagus</strong></h5>
<p>This sarcophagus was made not only to protect the body, but to house it before unification with ka. The great expense it took to create this work, was a display of status and prestige, as well as the deification of Tut.</p>
<p>The bright colouring indicated a better life in the after world. Special symbols were included to help the body ward off spirits. Holding the crook and flail was a pharaonic symbol of power.</p>
<p>Nut, the sky goddess wrapped her wings around the mummy as protection.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was King Tut?</strong></h5>
<p>King Tut was Akhenaton’s son with his sister. He was a sickly child and died by the age of 18, but not before marrying his sister. His tomb was small, which leaves historians to assume that his death was sudden and unexpected. With his brief life he was a minor figure in Egyptian history.</p>
<p>King Tut did manage to accomplish a few things in his short time frame. He overturned his father’s interest in the Amarna art and worship of Aten. He restored Egyptian religion to polytheism and Egyptian art to traditional styles.</p>
<p>His name, TutankhAMUN, is a reference to restoring power to the old god Amun.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was King Tut and his tomb so famous?</strong></h5>
<p>It was the only royal tomb untouched, until it discovered by British Howard Carter, in 1922. Interestingly, there is <strong>a curse associated</strong> with the tomb, with many stories about people who were in mysterious accidents or died after encountering it.</p>
<p>In January 2015, the funerary mask was damaged in cleaning. The beard was knocked off and a restorationist epoxied it back on in a messy fashion.</p>

<p>This <strong>mud-brick building, with limestone facing</strong> was built as part of the palace for Darius I, in Persepolis, in what is today Iran. There are 72 columns and two monumental stairways, with a wooden roof. Artificial terraces were created so it could be built on higher ground. The building is <strong>65 feet tall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Apadana </strong>(hall) was a <strong>hypostyle</strong>, or roof raised up by multiple columns, created a forest of columns. Some have bull headed capitals. The bulls are one continuous facing. Each are facing outward from each other, with two separate heads. Traces of color at other sites suggest these were brightly colored.</p>

<h5><strong>How was this Building Used?</strong></h5>
<p>The hall was used for receptions, festivals, and banquets by the king. When receiving his visitors here, he was able to display his power and magnificence.</p>
<p>Decoration on the interior matches the activities that would happen in the room. This included thousands of people carved into the walls, representing 23 nations.</p>
<p>It would later be destroyed by Alexander the Great along with the power of Persia.</p>

<p>In Athens, this is where the <strong>Parthenon </strong>is built. This building was created <strong>by architects</strong> <strong>Iktinos and Kallikrates. </strong>It is <strong>1,150 feet long. </strong>Interior décor was provided by <strong>artist Phidias.</strong></p>
<p>The Parthenon was dedicated to the goddess Athena. It glorified Athena Parthenos, the later word meaning virgin, which was highly valued in Athenian society. The goddess was an enforcer of such modesty. The Panathenaic Procession was a celebration of Athena’s birthday.</p>
<p>The north side was the temple of earlier sects and dedicated to earlier gods. The south side contained temples dedicated to Athena. All Athenians citizens were able to take part in the festivals. Only priests were allowed inside.</p>
<p>The building was also a celebration of the Greek victory over the Persians, while showcasing the Athenian wealth and power.</p>
<h5><strong>The Build</strong></h5>
<p>The front and back look the same, which was entirely intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Marble</strong> at the time was cheap and available. The roof was originally made with wood and capped with marble tiles. It would have been brightly painted at the time, so viewers could easily see and interpret the decorations.</p>
<h5><strong>Architectural Terms</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Peripteral</strong> temple is a temple with a <strong>colonnade </strong>on all four sides and based on <strong>peristyle</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Orders</strong> is style represented by <strong>columns and entablature</strong>. The types used in this building are Doric and Ionic. <strong>Doric </strong>was used for is the exterior, with fluted shafts, simple <strong>capitals</strong>, and <strong>entablature</strong> of <strong>triglyphs</strong> and <strong>metopes</strong>. <strong>Ionic </strong>was used is the interior and used fluted shafts, <strong>volute</strong> capitals, with entablature of frieze.</p>
<p>It was very unusual to combine orders. Art historians believe this was to show a united Greece, with the Doric representing the mainland style and the Iconic the preferred style of the Greek islands.</p>
<p>The building’s <strong>pediment, </strong>a trianglar part at the top front of the building that supports the roof was highly carved.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>A Series of Optical Illusions</strong></h5>
<p>Adjustments were made in the architecture to compensate for optical illusions. A <strong>stylobate </strong>or continuous base supporting the row of columns curves upward from center, as does the <strong>entablature</strong>. This acts to deflect the appearance of sagging in the middle.</p>
<p>The columns lean inward slightly. If the lines the were continued they would all meet 1.5 miles above the temple.  These columns are not evenly spaced to prevent the look of them being clustered.</p>
<p><strong>Entasis </strong>is a slight convex curve in the shaft of a column. The columns bulge out in the middle, and this works to give the illusion that they are straight and taper upward.</p>
<p>The columns in the corners were often surrounded by light. This made them look thinner. To remedy this, the columns here were made 2 inches thicker.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>A Visual of Strength</strong></h5>
<p>All decorations are a symbol of strength. The <strong>metopes</strong> or square blocks placed between the channeled triglyphs are carved. The west metopes are depicted with Amazonomachy, a mythical battle between the Amazons and Ancient Greeks. The east metopes illustrate the mythical battle between the gods and giants called Gigantomachy. The northside shows the Trojan war, while the south represents Centauromachy, the battle between the mythical centaurs with the Lapiths.</p>
<p>The pediments too provide stunning visuals. The east shows the birth of Athena, while the west is all about Poseidon versus Athena.</p>
<p>The <strong>cella</strong> or main room housed a massive <strong>chryselephantine </strong>statue of Athena, made from gold and ivory Parthenos, and carved by artist <strong>Phidias. </strong>She was fully armed with a shield, spear, and helmet. In her hand, she held Nike, the winged personification of Victory.</p>
<h5><strong>The Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>The<strong> Parthenon </strong>was converted into a Byzantine church, then a Catholic church, in the Middle Ages. Next, it made into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Greece. In 1678, Venetians attacked the Turks who were using it for storage for ammunition.</p>
<p>Venetian rockets hit Parthenon and the explosion blew out the center of the building. Today car exhaust is damaging the marble which is very porous.</p>

<ul>
<li>The right-hand side shows three goddesses probably Hestia (domesticity), Artemis/Diana (hunt, chastity, nature) and Aphrodite/Venus (love).</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>How Phidias Addresses the Awkward Pediment </strong></h5>
<p>Typically, sculptors ignored the corners since the space was too small to put any full-sized figures in. Phidias, however, uses the bottom line as a horizon line that figures can move through effortlessly. These are extremely life-like in terms of energy and form. The integration of the figures with one another makes them a complicated composition.</p>
<h5><strong>A Sense of Modesty</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Wet Drapery</strong>, is the way a sculpture is made to portray the folds of clothing, aiding to reveal the contours of the body underneath. It also defines the musculature of the body while maintaining propriety for women.</p>
<h5><strong>The Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>The sculpture was damaged when the building was converted into a church.</p>
<p>It was once nicknamed the Elgin Marbles when purchased in 1803 by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to Constantinople. He was accused of “stealing culture” as they are still owned by the British Museum. The work would have almost certainly been destroyed had he not removed them.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Louvre, Paris</p>
<p>This <strong>marble</strong> work is part of the 525 feet long frieze on the inside of the Ionic part of the Parthenon. This section is 96 feet by 2 feet and 7 inches. It is carved in <strong>low relief</strong> All the figures stand in <strong>contrapposto</strong>. The right knee breaks the fall of drapery.</p>
<p>The artist does not use <strong>hierarchy of scale</strong> and shows all on the same ground line through <strong>isocephalism</strong>. The work would have originally been painted, with a background painted blue, and the hair of the figures highlighted in gold.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Does This Work Represent?</strong></h5>
<p>The original theory is that it shows the Panathenaic Procession. Here the citizens of Athens honor Athena, by weaving a <strong>peplos</strong>. Six <strong>Ergastines,</strong> or young aristocratic women in charge of weaving the peplos, are greeted by two priests. They all walk in procession towards the Parthenon.</p>
<p>A new theory suggests it could be the depiction of the legendary Athenian king, <strong>Erechtheus</strong>, who sacrificed one of his daughters to save the city of Athens. An ancient wooden idol of the goddess Athena was said to have fallen from the skies during his reins. The sacrifice was under the guidance of Oracle of Delphi.</p>
<p>With either theory, the mood of the artwork is sombre, as the people wear grave expressions. It shows the religious piety of the upper class, and Athenians at large, and symbolizes the elite community in Athens coming together.</p>

<p><strong>This temple as was dedicated to </strong>Dedicated to Athena Victorious (Athena Nike), not to be confused with the goddess Nike.</p>
<p>This <strong>Amphiprostyle</strong> temple has four Ionic columns on the front and back.  It sits oddly on the edge of the Acropolis and there were concerns about it falling off. Around it is a <strong>parapet</strong> or low protective wall or barrier, 4 feet tall that acted as a guard rail.</p>
<p><strong>Temple of Athena Nike</strong> was built over the ruins of a previous temple to Nike. The Persians had destroyed this in 480 BCE.  It was built to commemorate the Greek victory over the Persians in the Battle of Marathon, in 490 BCE.  Part of the frieze is also dedicated to this battle.</p>
<p>Inside the temple there was a statue of Athena Nike. Nike’s image is repeated dozens of times. She often holds a pomegranate, a symbol of wealth.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 5: Nike Adjusting Her Sandal</strong></h5>

<p>This work depicts an image of Nike, made to be a part of the decorative program of the Temple of Athena Nike. The graceful figure is modeled in <strong>high relief</strong>.</p>
<p>Deeply <strong>incised</strong> drapery lines reveal her body. <strong>Wet drapery</strong> gives a sense of the weight of the cloth and the gathering around parts of the body. In this way, the awkward posture is rendered elegant and graceful.</p>
<p>Nike adjusts her sandal while her dress slips off one shoulder.</p>
<h5><strong>Location Choice</strong></h5>
<p>Why was the <strong>Acropolis</strong> chosen? Temples have been here since Neolithic times. The elevation  is high up, central, and visible. It was the site of Delian League Treasury or collection of money from Athenian city states that was used to combat Persians in Persian War.</p>
<h5><strong>Construction</strong></h5>
<p>It was constructed under the leadership of Pericles after the Persian sack of Athens, in 480 BCE, after they  destroyed the original Acropolis. Pericles used the extra funds from the Delian League in the Persian War treasury to build the Acropolis.</p>

<p><strong>The House of Vetti </strong>was one of the most luxurious private homes, or Roman townhouses known as <strong>domus, in Pompeii, Italy. </strong>The <strong>1, 1000 square meter</strong>,<strong> stone cut </strong>home was named for its owners, two successful brothers, who were former slaves and now freedmen, Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus. They were newly rich, through working as merchants and wanted a way to display their wealth.</p>

<p>Most of Pompeii had private homes with few exterior windows and one entrance from the street. At the House of Vettii the entrance is through a <strong>foyer</strong> into an <strong>atrium, or open-air courtyard </strong>with an<strong> impluvium, </strong>or sunken space to catch the rainwater<strong>.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> Cubiculas, </strong>or private bedrooms surrounded the atrium.  Typically, homes had a second <strong>atrium</strong> which was surrounded by a <strong>peristyle</strong> or rectangle of columns. Atriums/peristyle courtyards are sources of illumination.</p>
<h5><strong>Pentheus Room</strong></h5>
<p>Here, Pompeiian <strong>wall frescoes</strong> are preserved which has allowed historians to study them.</p>
<p>Historians found there were four styles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>First Style</strong> was faux marble blocks.</li>
<li>The <strong>Second Style</strong> was naturalistic scenes, as though looking through a window.</li>
<li>The <strong>Third Style</strong> included slender architectural details, often done in gold or yellow.</li>
<li>The <strong>Fourth Style</strong> was a combination of all three, often with scenes of mythological images.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Roman architect Vitruvius wrote <em>De Architectura (On Architecture) </em>in 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE<em>. </em>He mentioned the Etruscan Temple of Minerva. He also outlined the key elements and proportions of a Roman home.</p>
<p>This home was discovered in the 18<sup>th</sup> century during archaeological excavations that unearthed Pompeii. The city of Pompeii had been buried in volcanic ash, with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Palazzo Torlonia, Rome</p>
<p><strong> </strong>This work, approximately <strong>14 inches high</strong>, is crafted from <strong>marble</strong> and <strong>polychromed</strong> or painted in several different colors. This is a <strong>p</strong><strong>ortrait</strong> in <strong>bust </strong>form from the shoulders up.</p>
<p>The function was to depict a person accurately. The <strong>veristic </strong>style is one that is highly realistic and often exaggerated. The old man looks old indeed. Yet in Roman times age meant wisdom, experience, and respect. This face of a Roman <strong>patrician </strong>aristocrat, nobleman or senator, is also toothless, with a sagging jawline. The name of the individual is unknown.</p>
<h5><strong>Patrons of Roman Art</strong></h5>
<p>Patrons of Roman art were almost all men from old and distinguished families.  They were fiercely proud of their lineage and wanted to preserve likenesses of themselves and ancestors. <strong>Roman Republic art</strong> was not interested in idealization and perfection in form but interested in work ethic and civic service.</p>

<p><strong>Forum of Trajan, </strong>in<strong> Rome, Italy,  </strong>is made of<strong> concrete and brick. </strong>It measures<strong> 980 feet by 607 feet. </strong>Trajan was a great military general who expanded the Roman Empire to its largest borders. Like Julius Caesar he wanted to have his own forum. Yet, there was no space available in Rome at the time.</p>
<p>Trajan asked his best architect <strong>Apollodorus of Damascus</strong> to remove a hill in the city to build the Forum of Trajan.</p>
<p>The Romans did not particularly like <strong>concrete</strong>, but it was cheap, and they always covered it with marble or <strong>brick</strong> as with the <strong>Forum of Trajan</strong>. Concrete also let the Romans build in new ways that were not limited to <strong>post-and-lintel</strong> construction<strong>. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>A Public Space Of Power</strong></h5>
<p>The Forum of Trajan was a civic space, a  hub that became an administrative, commercial, and political center.  It commemorated the Romans’ victory over the Dacians.</p>
<p>Trajan’s Forum was the size of all other imperial forums put together. Here the military general was able to show his power, prestige, merit, and virtue.</p>
<h5><strong>A Quick Tour of the Forum</strong></h5>
<p>At the entryway, there is an over-life size gilded bronze statue of emperor. The Basilica Ulpia with apses, has libraries filled with Greek and Roman literature. Additionally, there is the Column of Trajan and the Temple of Trajan.</p>
<h5><strong>Basilica Ulpia</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-290" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-290" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Basilica-Ulpia.jpg?resize=600%2C426&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-290" class="wp-caption-text">Basilica Ulpia (reconstruction drawing) © Gilbert Gorski and James Packer</figcaption></figure>
<p>The word <strong>Ulpia</strong> comes from Trajan’s family name.</p>
<p><strong>Basilica Ulpia</strong> was a law court and the largest basilica in Rome.  The <strong>apse </strong>was where the judge sat, with space illumination achieved by clerestory windows. The ceilings were <strong>coffered</strong>, a technique allowing spaces of the concrete to be carved to lighten the weight.</p>
<p>The basilica was decorated with niches, carvings, relief sculptures and free-standing sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>Basilica Ulpia </strong>is considered the most important architectural design in Rome. The architect took the design of the Greek Parthenon, hollowed it out and added apses.  The building shape and design came to signify authority.</p>
<p>The basilica can accommodate large numbers of people. There is one single entrance and exit  to control the flow of people and one single vantage point upon entering.</p>
<h5><strong>Trajan Markets</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-291" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-291" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Trajan-Market.png?resize=700%2C470&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="470" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Trajan-Market.png?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Trajan-Market.png?resize=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Trajan-Market.png?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Trajan-Market.png?w=1159&amp;ssl=1 1159w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-291" class="wp-caption-text">Trajan markets<br />© Franz-Marc Frei/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>This was a two-story market with 150 shops and offices. The shops, or <strong>taberna</strong>, varied in size and were rented to shopkeepers. Each shop had a small store-front and storage rooms in the back. These were part of a semi-circular building, with <strong>clerestory</strong> windows or windows along the roofline. It was built using <strong>groin vault</strong> construction.</p>
<h5><strong>Column of Trajan</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-292" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-292" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Column-of-Trajan.jpg?resize=450%2C672&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="450" height="672" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-292" class="wp-caption-text">Trajan markets<br />© Franz-Marc Frei/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>The grounds were made up of 125 feet high Roman Doric columns.  Each were 12 feet in diameter and made up 114 individual themes.</p>
<p><strong>Column of Trajan</strong> is made of stone from Luna, Italy. Eight solid <strong>marble </strong>pieces were quarried for the base, with 20 pieces 10 feet in diameter for the column. Each piece is individually carved to create a continuous spiral frieze.  The composition is crowded with 2500 low relief figures. The work shows the Romans at battle, winning with superior military skills.</p>
<p>This was originally commissioned to be a lookout tower and later was converted to a war memorial.  It commemorated Trajan’s campaigns against the Dacians of modern-day Romania. Trajan’s ashes are now located in the base.</p>
<p>The column could be entered, and once inside a spiral staircase led to a viewing platform.</p>

<h3><strong>3500 BCE- 300 BCE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-220" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=550%2C697&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="550" height="697" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?w=273&amp;ssl=1 273w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>TOPIC 2.2 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Ancient Mediterranean Art</strong></h4>
<p>A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures.  This interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest, and/or colonization. This may also include forms of artistic influences. Works of art illustrate the active exchange of ideas and reception of artistic styles among the Mediterranean cultures and the subsequent influence on the classical world.</p>
<h5><strong>A Recorded History</strong></h5>
<p>The study of artistic innovations and conventions developed in the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt was aided by recorded information from the time. This provides a foundation for comparative understanding of subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond.</p>
<h5><strong>Influencing Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artists and architects were influenced by earlier Mediterranean cultures. Etruscan and Roman artists and architects accumulated and creatively adapted Greek objects and forms. In this way, they were able create buildings and artworks that appealed to their tastes for eclecticism and historicism. Many Hellenistic works are in fact Roman in origin.  This favors presenting these traditions at the same time such as spolia, appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other</p>
<h4><strong>(2) 27. Anavysos Kouros </strong></h4>
<p>Greek. 530 BCE. Archaic Greek.</p>

<p>This <strong>marble statue stands 6 feet 4 inches tall</strong> and is from the archaic period. This sculpture in the round would have been <strong>painted</strong> and there are still traces of paint in the hair.  As was typical of this period, it is a kouros, or young man, represented in the ideal of perfect, male form.</p>
<p>During this period in art, there was increasing interest in a more lifelike rendering of the human figure. The torso and limbs have greater anatomical accuracy. The figures are more rounded and there is swelling in the hips, calves, abdomen, and cheeks.</p>
<h5><strong>Archaic Kouros characteristics</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pose: left leg out with weight evenly split (just like Menkaure)</li>
<li>Sharp shins</li>
<li>Heavily delineated abs</li>
<li>Traditional braiding of the hair with traditional headband</li>
<li>Archaic smile (figure transcends this world; nobility; knowledge of the peace of the afterlife)</li>
<li>Hands are stuck to the sides creating a sense of stability and even rigidity</li>
</ul>
<h5>Offerings and Markets</h5>
<p>These sculptures were used <strong>offering to the gods or grave markings</strong>, as this one was.  It also comes with an inscription:</p>
<p>“Stay and mourn at the monument of the dead Kroises who raging Ares slew as he fought in the front ranks.”</p>
<p>This signifies that the young man Kroises, was killed in war, as Aries was the god of war. This was the most noble way to die and these men were considered heros.</p>
<p>Kouros could also be gods. The most frequently portrayed was Apollo.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> National Archaeological Museum, Athens</p>
<p>This <strong>marble copy, with remnants of paint</strong> is a work after a bronze originally by artist Polykleitos. In the sculpture’s hand there was once spear.</p>
<p>Polykleitos was working in Athens.  in the Golden Age of Athenian history and art. There were three philosophical ideas that affect Polykleitos’ work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Idealism: pursuit of perfection (intellectual and physical)</li>
<li>Rationalism: reason and emotion, with calm stoicism and control over the body.</li>
<li>Humanism: the basis for the canon for an ideal man’s height is seven heads.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Canon of Proportion</strong></h5>
<p>Polykleitos sought to create the perfect human body ideal through mathematical form.<strong> Canon of proportion</strong>: head is one-seventh of entire body.</p>
<h5><strong>Contrapposto</strong></h5>
<p>He used <strong>contrapposto</strong>, an uneven weight distributed to the legs, which causes the hips to dip and the shoulders to counterbalance. This illustrates by the artist in not just idealized body parts, but in how the body of a real figure would stand.</p>
<h5><strong>Harmony of Opposites</strong></h5>
<p>This theory suggested if both symmetry and action were achieved in sculpture, it would take on beauty. To achieve a look of movement, it had to look natural, by using the harmony of opposites. If one leg of the sculpture appeared to be moving , then the rest of the body must respond and act accordingly.</p>
<h5><strong>Alternating twisting</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Head to left</li>
<li>Shoulders/hips to right</li>
<li>Knees to left</li>
<li>Ankles to right</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Alternating angles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Angle of eyes and shoulders go from top right to bottom left</li>
<li>Angle of hips go from top left to bottom right</li>
<li>Angle of knees go from top left to bottom right</li>
<li>Angle of ankles go from top right to bottom left</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>His right side vs his left side</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Right side is straightened limbs</li>
<li>Left side is bent limbs</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Alternating relaxed vs. engaged body parts</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Right arm and Left leg are relaxed</li>
<li>Left arm and Right leg are engaged</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What is the Lost Wax Method?</strong></h5>
<p>The original bronze was made using a process called <strong>lost-wax method.</strong></p>
<p>The first step in the lost wax <strong>method</strong> is to make a clay model. Then, it needs to be covered with wax.  The wax clay model is put inside a clay case. A hold is cut at the bottom. Next, the model is heated.  The wax will drip out and leave a small space between the clay interior and the clay case.</p>
<p>Once complete, the artist tips the entire work upside down so that the hole faces upward and pours in liquid bronze. It will fit into that small space where the wax was originally.</p>
<p>Once dry, the artist tilts it back upward again and cracks of the clay.</p>
<p>This is called the <strong>lost wax method, </strong>as the wax is lost when it drips out of the clay case.</p>
<p>Also, the process was “lost” after the fall of the Roman Empire.  It was not “discovered” again until Donatello in the 15<sup>th</sup> century during the Southern Renaissance.</p>
<h5><strong>Where the Roman Marble Copy was Found</strong></h5>
<p>This sculpture was found in a palestro, an area where athletes worked out, in Pompeii, Italy. In one hand, the sculpture once held a sphere.  It is thought that this idealized male form, standing at 6 feet 11 inches, was an inspiration of fitness to the athletes.</p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Marble</strong></h5>
<p>Romans liked to work in marble because of its sense of permanence. Bronze is easily damage.  However, the hard part of working with marble is that it is heavy, and figures cannot always stay standing upright and unsupported.</p>
<p>To help support these figures, Romans used <strong>struts,</strong> a piece that joins the arm to the hip, and tree trunks acted as kick stands.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Vatican Museum</p>
<p>In <strong>Augustus of Prima Porta, </strong>this <strong>marble</strong> work, standing <strong>six feet and six inches</strong>, Augustus is dressed in his best finery. He is depicted in his ideal youth, as a powerful figure. The work was originally painted.</p>
<h5><strong>In Detail</strong></h5>
<p>Based closely on Doryphoros by Polykleitos, the sculpture stands in <strong>contrapposto. </strong>The relaxed stance of the Primaporta statue also gives it the look of being real and portraying action.</p>
<p>His breast plate, or <strong>cuirass</strong>, is a detailed canvass for the story he wanted to tell. In pictures it depicts battles he won. Sol and Caelus, the sun god and sky god appear.  There are female figures that represent countries he conquered. Apollo, Diana, and the earth god Tellus also are present.</p>
<p>At his feet is Cupid riding a dolphin. Cupid is the son of Venus and this inclusion hinted at that Augustus was descended from the gods. (In fact, it was declared true the day he died!) The dolphin was the symbol of his navel victory at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. Here he overtook Antony and Cleopatra, becoming the sole ruler of the empire.</p>
<h5><strong>Political Propaganda</strong></h5>
<p>The message was clear. Good would come to the Romans. All thanks to Augustus.</p>
<p>Caesar Augustus was the founder of the Roman Empire and the first Emperor of Rome. He was an ambitious man. In his book he wrote:</p>
<p><em>“In my nineteenth year, on my own initiative and at my own expense, I raised an army with which I set free the state, which was oppressed by the domination of a faction.” </em></p>
<p>Augustus was less than 19 when he inherited Julius Caesar’s empire</p>
<p>The work is a piece or political propaganda. Found at Livia’s home, Villa of Livia in Prima Porta, Rome, this is where senators and generals were invited.</p>

<p>The Colosseum (a nickname for the Flavian Amphitheatre) is a work in <strong>stone and concrete</strong> that took 10 years to build. It could accommodate up to 50,000 people and measures <strong>615’ long x 510’ wide.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>What is the Difference Between a Theater and an Amphitheater?</strong></h5>
<p>A theatre is half a circle, while an amphitheatre is a full circle.</p>
<h5><strong>The Details</strong></h5>
<p>Above each ground floor arch is a carved number in Roman numerals: this indicated the seating section for spectators; there were 76 entrances or <strong>vomitoria</strong> that encircled the bottom.</p>
<p>The seating was determined by status. The emperor had his own private box.  On the first level sat senators, magistrates, vestal virgins, and wealthy women. The second level was reserved for knights and generals. The third and fourth level were for the middle class. The fifth level held women and the poor.</p>
<h5><strong>A Concrete Construction</strong></h5>
<p>Built with concrete technology, this led to new shapes, such as curved walls. The concrete was made with lime mortar, volcanic sand, and water that was mixed. It was then placed in wooden frames to dry.</p>
<p>To make sure concrete pieces stay rigidly attached to one another, instead of using mortar, Romans used lead and bronze pins, like a skeleton that held multiple blocks together. Concrete formed the core but the outside was covered with travertine.</p>
<p>Romans believed that concrete was effective and practical but ugly. Concrete was cheaper than importing tufa or Greek marble. Also general labourers, or in this case Roman slaves could work in the construction and not specialists.</p>
<h5><strong>Arches</strong></h5>
<p>The Romans were masters at building arches and the Colosseum masters the arch. The arches were built with a wooden frames underneath that could be removed. Each stone must be wedge-shaped or smaller at bottom than on top. If this was achieved correctly, mortar was not needed.</p>
<p>A<strong> voussoir</strong> is individual stones of an arch. A <strong>keystone </strong>is the topmost, central stone in an arch. Arches can be extended or stretched horizontally into <strong>barrel vaults</strong>. This building shows three circular <strong>barrel vaults</strong> that are layered upon one another.  Two-barrel vaults that intersect are called <strong>groin vaults. </strong>An arch rotated in space is called a <strong>dome.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Columns</strong></h5>
<p>The façade has <strong>engaged columns</strong>, columns that are rounded but attached to a building on the back side. First story is Tuscan or Doric with a base. The second story is Ionic. The third story is Corinthian. Each order or section is lighter, more decorative and complex than the order</p>
<h5><strong>A Moving Floor and Ceiling</strong></h5>

<p>The floor was built with trap doors, and completely covered with sand so that it was pitch black underneath. There were working elevators that were pulled up by rope, to bring props, animals, and people up to the stage.</p>
<p>A velarium or shade, in the form of a retractable roof, was pulled to cover the wide opening at the top of the building.</p>
<h5><strong>The Spectacle</strong></h5>
<p>In the morning, the audience could watch animal hunts. Exotic animals were brought in for these events. There were wolves from Italy, giraffes from Africa, bears from Germany and crocodiles from the Nile. These animals were kept in the dark depths of the building<strong>, </strong>starving for days to encourage aggression.</p>
<p>At lunch time, prisoners were executed. In the afternoon, Gladiators, competed to the death. There were sometimes up to 100 games per day.</p>
<p>Large theatrical events also took place a naval battle was recreated with 3,000 participants and the flooding of the Colosseum.</p>
<h5><strong>In Context</strong></h5>
<p>The building was named Flavian Amphitheater after the new ruling family the Flavians. They followed the Julio-Claudians, who end when Nero commits suicide. Nero was the last Julio-Claudian, His reign was marked by extravagance, corruption, and brutality. He burned Christians and killed his mother and wife, before killing himself.</p>
<p>First Flavian ruler was Vespasian. He chose to claim back public land, in which Nero had taken from the people and built a private palace park, with an artificial lake. Here he built Flavian Amphitheater ( Colosseum) This he used to entertain the masses.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Crusaders caused damage to the Colosseum, by removing lead and bronze pins for their weaponry. To find these pins, they had to dig holes in the Colosseum.</p>

<h3><strong>3500 BCE- 300 BCE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-220" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=750%2C951&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="951" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?w=273&amp;ssl=1 273w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seated-scribe.jpg?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 2.1  Cultural Contexts of Ancient Mediterranean Art</strong></h5>
<p>Art and art making of the Ancient Mediterranean illustrates the active exchange of ideas, reception of artistic styles, and a subsequent influence on the classical world. The study of artistic innovations and conventions developed in the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt provides a foundation for comparative understanding of subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artists and architects were influenced by earlier Mediterranean cultures. This provides the foundation for the exploration of art in Europe and the Americas. Here we can compare developments, consider continuities and changes over time, and build an understanding of how these works fit into a larger artistic tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Art of the Ancient Near East</strong></h5>
<p>The art of the <strong>ancient Near East</strong>, today represents the countries of  <strong>Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Cyprus</strong>. Art from this area from <strong>3500 to 330 BCE</strong> is associated with successive city-states and cultural powers—<strong>Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, NeoBabylonian, and Persian.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Religion </strong>also plays a significant role in the art and architecture of the ancient Near East. <strong>Cosmology</strong> is a force guiding representation of deities and kings who themselves assume divine attributes.</p>
<h5><strong>Art of Dynastic Egypt</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>art of dynastic Egypt</strong>, which in present-day is <strong>Egypt and Sudan</strong>, encompasses art from <strong>3000 to 300 BCE</strong>. It generally includes coverage of predynastic Egypt and <strong>Old, Middle</strong>, and <strong>New Kingdoms.</strong></p>
<p>The Amarna period or New KIngdom was also important because of its cultural reform and stylistic revolution. The art of dynastic Egypt embodies a sense of permanence. It was created for eternity in the service of a culture that focused on preserving a cycle of rebirth.</p>
<p>Egyptian art incorporates <strong>mythological and religious symbolism</strong>, often centered on <strong>the cult of the sun</strong>. Representations of humans make clear distinctions between the deified pharaoh and people in lower classes.  It uses representational and stylistic cues such as hierarchical proportion and idealization versus naturalism.</p>
<p>Approaches to portraiture depend on a figure’s rank in society. The artistic canon of dynastic Egypt, with strict conventions of representation, use of materials, and treatment of forms, was followed for many centuries with only short-lived periods of experimentation and deviation. Innovations in art and architecture tended to occur within the basic and established scheme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>MESOPTAMIAN ART</strong></h5>
<p>The art of the <strong>ancient Near East</strong> (present day <strong>Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan</strong> , <strong>Cyprus</strong>) is associated with the <strong>city-states and cultures of Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Persia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sumerian Art </strong>(3500 -2340 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Akkadian Art</strong> (2340 &#8211; 2180 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Neo-Sumerian Art</strong> (2150-2000 BCE)</p>
<p><strong>Babylonian Art </strong>(1792-1750 BCE)</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Ancient Greek Art</strong></h5>
<p>Ancient Greek art was produced in <strong>Europe and western Asia</strong>, primarily in the region of <strong>present-day Greece, Turkey, and southern Italy</strong>, from <strong>600 BCE to 100 BCE</strong>. Art considered Ancient Greek includes works from the <strong>Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic</strong> periods, as defined according to artistic style, not by political units such as governments or dynasties.</p>

<h5><strong>Etruscan Art</strong></h5>
<p>Etruscan art, from the <strong>region of Eutruria in</strong> <strong>central Italy</strong>, was produced before <strong>700 to 100 BCE</strong>. Etruscan art is typically considered as a single cultural unit even though Etruria was composed of separate city-states.</p>

<h5><strong>Ancient Roman Art</strong></h5>
<p>Ancient Roman art was produced in <strong>Europe and western Asia</strong> from <strong>753 to 337 BCE</strong>.  Roman art includes works from the <strong>republican, early imperial, late imperial, and late antique periods</strong>, as defined using governmental structures and dynasties rather than stylistic characteristics.</p>

<h5><strong>The Art of Story Telling</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Greek, Etruscan, and Roman cultures</strong> shared a rich tradition of epic <strong>storytelling</strong>. This was first shared in voice and later written in text.  It glorified the exploits of gods, goddesses, and heroes. The texts recorded a highly developed rhetorical tradition that prized public oratory and poetry. Religious rituals and prognostications were guided by oral tradition, not texts.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek religious and civic architecture and figural representation are characterized by idealized proportions and spatial relationships, expressing societal values of harmony and order.</p>
<p>Art from the Etruscan and Roman periods is typified by stylistic and iconographical eclecticism and portraiture. Roman architecture is also characterized by borrowing from its immediate predecessors (Greek and Etruscan) and by technical innovation.</p>
<h5><strong>The Development of Ancient Mediterranean Art Forms</strong></h5>
<p>Art and art making take many different forms both within and across cultures. The materials, processes, and techniques employed may also vary by location and culture, with wide-ranging influence on the art that is generated.</p>
<h5><strong>Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>Artists created fully developed, formal types, of art. Sculptures of human figures were made interacting with gods. Stylistic conventions that represented the human form combined <strong>profile and three-quarter view</strong>. In these combinations, important figures are set apart.  Using a <strong>hierarchical scale</strong> or dividing the compositions into horizontal sections or registers, these sculptures provide significant early examples of historical narratives.</p>
<h5><strong>Architectural Construction</strong></h5>
<p>The Egyptian architectural construction of the clerestory is particularly important for the history of architecture. Development of monumental stone architecture culminated with the <strong>pyramids.</strong> These architectural masterpieces, with innovative designs for rock-cut tombs and pylons&#8211;the term for massive, sloped gateway.</p>
<p>Each pyramid was built to demonstrate the importance of the pharaoh. Each god-king had absolute power, descended directly from the <strong>sun god</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>White Temple and its ziggurat</em></strong> was built in <strong>Urek</strong>, which in modern times is <strong>Warka, in Iraq</strong>. It is made of <strong>baked mud brick</strong>, as stone was too expensive, and wood had to be imported.  The base of the ziggurat <strong>measures 40 feet</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>buttress</strong> is spaced across the surface to create a light and shadow pattern. This helps rainwater wash down pre-designed channels. It also helps to strengthen the building.</p>
<p>The <strong>façade </strong>or exterior of the building, was whitewashed, with ground white shells or bone. Its purpose was to attract the sun and provide illumination. Rectangular in structure, it measures 17.5 meters by 22.3 meters.</p>
<p>People would ascend via staircase or ramp as the <strong>ground plan</strong> reveals . This brought people up to the top, but not directly to the entryway (<strong>bent axis</strong>)</p>

<h5><strong>What is a ziggurat?</strong></h5>
<p>A ziggurat is a raised platform. It lifted the White Temple to make it visible.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was this Built?</strong></h5>
<p>The temple functioned as a dedication <strong>to the sky God Anu</strong>.  It was a place for public prayer, worship, and ritual. Priests and royalty had access to temple at the top.</p>
<h5><strong>Into the Darkness</strong></h5>
<p>The Interior of this temple was very dark to symbolize of the presence of the divine.  Darkness was magical, mysterious, and the place where deities and supernatural forces resided.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>This is the earliest ziggurat that still survives.</p>
<p>Neolithic civilizations placed tremendous significance on religious institutions. This temple was the spiritual, literal, economic and political center of a community. There are no burials here.</p>

<p>Considered so valuable, the <strong>Palette of King Narmer</strong>, has never been allowed to leave Egypt. It’s high quality of craftsmanship make it invaluable.</p>
<h5><strong>A Beautiful Form </strong></h5>
<p>The large work is more than two feet in height and beautifully carved, from <strong>greywacke </strong>siltstone in a grey-green color. King Narmer is depicted within the low relief carving, as well as other symbols, with debatable meanings. The work measures <strong>25 by 16 inches.</strong></p>
<p>The elaborate scenes are depicted in <strong>low relief sculpture</strong>, set in registers or horizontal zones. The images offer a <strong>twisted perspective</strong> and a delineation of musculature.</p>
<h5><strong>On the Front</strong></h5>
<p>On the front Narmer wears a cobra crown of Lower Egypt. The Hathor or cow goddess is at the top. Narmer is proceeded by four standard bearers and a priest, followed by a sandal bearer. The serpopards, a cross between a serpent and leopard symbolizes the unification of Egypt.  At the bottom, Narmer is a bull knocking down city fortress.</p>
<h5><strong>On the Back</strong></h5>
<p>On the back, Hathor as a cow is still along the top register. Hawk is the god Horus, holding a rope around a decapitated man’s head. Narmer has symbols of strength, with a bull’s tail at his waist, and wears the white crown of Upper Egypt. This crown is a symbol of dazzling brilliance of midday sun and nocturnal light of stars and moon. Servant holds sandals. Narmer is the king/god who walks barefoot. Defeated are enemies below his feet.</p>

<h5><strong>The Purpose</strong></h5>
<p>The work was <strong>dedicated to Horus</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>In Daily Use</strong></h5>
<p>In general, palettes were part of everyday life. The function was to grind makeup and to mix eyeliner. This black substance was ringed around the eyes to prevent the glare from the sun. A method used long before sunglasses were invented!</p>
<p>The design of a palette could be simple or elaborate depending on who owned it or a <strong>hierarchy of scale.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Historical Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>Discovered at the site of Hierakonpolis, the capital of Egypt during the time, in an early temple of the falcon god Horus, the object was found ivory statues, knife handles, figurines of animals and stone vessels. It was customary to keep objects that had been dedicated to the gods and bury them to make way for new offerings.</p>
<p>This work gives evidence of a sophisticated civilization along the Nile appearing around 3,500 BCE and the unification of Egypt (Upper – southern; Lower – northern) which was critical to future Egyptian success.</p>

<p>Found in <strong>Tell Azmar, Iraq,</strong> <strong><em>Statues of votive figures, from the Square Temple at Eshnunna</em></strong> were crafted from <strong>gypsum, inlaid, </strong>or embedded<strong>, with shell and black limestone</strong>. The tallest stands at <strong>2 feet 6 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Votive Offerings</strong></h5>
<p>The function of votive figures was to replicate the donor, in an act of prayer to the gods. This would represent prayer 24 hours a day, as the gods were temperamental.</p>
<p>These would have been placed in the temple of the god Abu, the god of vegetation, facing a statue or alter of a god. These sculptures were represented on a <strong>hierarchy of scale</strong>, in that a wealthier person would have a much larger sculpture.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The eyes are wide, as if in awe. Men are depicted with bare chest and arms, while woman were fully clothed for modesty.   On the backs of the sculptures are the words “ it offers prayer”.</p>
<h5><strong>What was Animism?</strong></h5>
<p>The religion in Mesotamia was <strong>Animism</strong>, a belief that natural forces were controlled by the gods. There was a god of rain, a god of water and many more.  They also believed these gods were easily angered.</p>

<p>This work was found in <strong>Saqqarra</strong>, an important Old Kingdom, southwest of <strong>Cairo, Egypt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seated Scribe</strong>, a <strong>20-inch tall</strong>, lifelike, sculpture in the round. This representation of a scribe, seated, with legs crossed, is wearing a white kilt. The medium is <strong>limestone</strong> that has been <strong>painted</strong>. Yet, the nipples are made with <strong>wooden dowels</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Details</strong></h5>
<p>The eyes are made to look real, which becomes the focus of the work. Made with <strong>polished crystal,</strong> blue organic matters were added behind to keep the stone in place. It also acts as a colour for the iris. There is an indentation representing the pupil. The eyes are etched with black eyeliner, as was the fashion of the time.</p>
<p>The artists took great care in carving the work, as scribes were considered an essential part of the community. They were the only ones who could write and therefore record history. His hands are beautifully crafted, and each nail is precise. In one hand there is a rolled piece of papyrus. In the other, there would have been a writing instrument that is no longer part of the work.</p>
<p>The focus is on the front of the sculpture, yet that is irrelevant, as it was made as a <strong>funerary sculpture.</strong></p>
<p>The way that the scribe is depicted in a <strong>natural</strong> way, with body fat exposed, is much different than gods were portrayed. Gods were formed in a much more stylistic way.</p>
<h5><strong>The Ka Statue </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ka</strong> is a human soul. Upon death, for the ka to live on, it must imbed itself in something.</p>
<p>Mummification was ideal but prohibitively expensive for most people. The <strong>ka statue</strong> had to be a good likeness, so the ka could find it.  Most Egyptians could not afford ka statues either.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Standard of Ur from the Royal Tombs at Ur</em></strong>, was found in<strong> Tell el-Muqayyar, Iraq</strong>,  in what appeared to be a tomb of a soldier. A <strong>standard </strong>is something brought to war, hence the name.</p>
<p>The <strong>wooden box, measuring 8.5 inches tall by 19.5 inches wide</strong> is decorated with <strong>white shells</strong>, (from the Persian Gulf) <strong>lapis lazuli</strong> (from Afghanistan) and <strong>red limestone</strong> (from India). This is both a symbol of the wealth of Mesopotamian (Sumerian) groups and cross-cultural trade.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the box held. Some historians think it could have been used for a musical instrument or for a coin box.</p>
<p>This double-sided artwork shows three <strong>registers</strong>, depicted three segments of society. It’s a <strong>historical narrative</strong> about war and peace.</p>
<h5><strong>Peace</strong></h5>
<p>At the bottom, the working-class hull heavy loads with the help of animals. In the centre register, the wealthier members of society walk with herds of animals, such sheep, rams, and goats.</p>
<p>At the top are the elite. The king is depicted as the largest figure, seated on a throne. Other members of the king’s group are also seated. All are raising glasses. Servants are depicted as smaller figures. Entertainers are entering to the far right.</p>

<h5><strong>War</strong></h5>
<p>At the top, the Sumerian king has exited his chariot. He inspects his captives who are nude. This was a way of debasing people in Mesopotamia. The middle register illustrates the Sumerian army revealed through a line of soldiers.  At the bottom, rather than seeing many chariots, we are seeing one chariot in continuous narrative. The horse moves from a walk to a canter to a gallop.</p>

<p>The Great Pyramids, <strong>in Giza, Egypt</strong> were built from <strong>cut limestone</strong>, for three rulers. There was Khufa, Khafre and Menkaure. Each pyramid was part of a royal <strong>mortuary temple</strong> complex. Each pyramid was built to reflect the sun’s rays.  The function was to enable the pharaoh to reach the sun in the afterlife. The complex included boats to assist with the journey.</p>
<h5><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-230" style="color: #333333; font-size: 1.0625rem;" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Great-Pyramids-plan.png?resize=500%2C511&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="511" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<p>Great Pyramids plan</p>
<h5><strong>Great Pyramid</strong></h5>
<p>The<strong> Great Pyramid</strong>, the largest of the three was built for Khufu. It took 23 years to build and is <strong>481 feet tall and 750 feet </strong>at base length. It was constructed of 2.3 million blocks that ranged from 2.5 tons to 50 tons each.</p>
<p>The original outer casings were made of <strong>white limestones</strong>, to shine in the bright sunlight. At the top. There once was a <strong>gilded capstone</strong> known as a <strong>pyriamidion</strong>. This reflected light, causing the pyramid to be observed from a great distance.  Today, only the inner stones remain. These were roughly constructed and filled with gypsum.</p>
<p>To enter the Great Pyramid, one must crawl through a tight opening before entering the Grand Gallery.</p>
<h5><strong>Additional Structures</strong></h5>
<p>Smaller pyramids were built for Queens. Additionally, small rectangular structures, with flat roofs and sloping side, known as <strong>mastabas</strong> or benches, in Arabic, were part of the complex. It was an honour to be buried close to the king and therefore there was a hierarchy as to who was buried where.</p>
<h5><strong>Great Sphinx</strong></h5>
<p>Great Sphinx was carved <strong>in situ, meaning on site</strong> from huge rock, set in the original setting. It was brightly painted and is the largest carving in the world from a single stone. Great Sphinx was crafted to protects pyramids behind it, in the manner of Lamassu.</p>
<p><strong>Sphinx</strong> is the Greek word for a lion body, eagle wings, and a woman’s head. This is a  <strong>hybrid </strong>animal with the head of the pharaoh, and the powerful body of lion. The lion is also a royal symbol connected to the pharaohs and the sun.</p>
<h5><strong>A Place of Worship</strong></h5>
<p>Every pyramid had an adjoining <strong>mortuary temple. </strong>It was a cult of deceased kings. The dead kings became pharaohs.  Offerings were made, ceremonies performed, and cloth and food were stored here. Cult statues of pharaohs were placed inside to serve as a focus for worship.</p>

<p>In 1910, a large collection of statuary was <strong>found in Valley Temple</strong>, connected to the Pyramid of Menkaure. This <strong>joint portrait statue </strong>is carved from a smooth grey stone known as <strong>greywacke </strong>and <strong>stands 4 feet 6 inches tall</strong><strong>. </strong>It is<strong> subtractive </strong>or carved out of one block of stone<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Both the king and queen are facing forward, in this <strong>sculpture in the round</strong>. Both have one foot stepping forward, and the king’s head is turned to the right slightly, suggesting movement.  They are lifelike but idealized and not realistic.</p>
<h5><strong>Perfecting Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Canon of proportion</strong> in this time was the ideal proportions of body. It was based on units. One unit was measured by the size of a closed fist. The heel to hairline is 18 units. The knees are five units up. The elbows are 12 up and the neck is 16 up.</p>
<h5><strong>A Woman of Mystery</strong></h5>
<p>The king is portrayed as young and lean, wearing the traditional white kilt and a pharaoh’s headdress called a nemes. Historians have suggested that because the queen is the same height as the king, and that her arms are around him in a protective way, that she is his mother and not one of his wives. Others says this could indicate her prominence or their marital status, and displays a strong, united Egypt.</p>
<p>The statue was not inscribed like others were. The face of King Menkaura is the same as others that were inscribed identifying him. Yet, the queen’s identity remains a mystery.</p>

<p>This temple in its massive form, made from <strong>cut sandstone and brick</strong> was the main religious center of the god Amun-Re, the sun god, located in <strong>Karnark, near Luxor, Egypt</strong>. It  also held a precinct for the God Mut and Montu. One of the largest religious complexes in the world, it has a <strong>main temple of 61 acres</strong>.</p>
<p>The building has a <strong>pylon entrance</strong>, with two towers on a mountain, and the horizon coming up between the two.</p>
<p>The <strong>axial building </strong>has an elongated floor plan and is constructed from sandstone and mud brick. It has an open court or space open to the sky, supported by colonnades.</p>
<p>Early development started in the Middle Kingdom (2055- 1650 BCE) As the city of Thebes became more important, pharaohs began to add new developments. The main part would grow to include 20 temples, a working space for priests, kitchens, and a sacred lake.</p>
<p>Many of the stones used in construction were ripped down in ancient times. There are still notes of interest like the tallest obelisk in Egypt that was made from red granite. It was <strong>dedicated to a female pharaoh Hatshepsut </strong>who ruled during the New Kingdom.</p>
<h5><strong>Hypostyle Hall</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-234" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hypostyle-Hall.jpg?resize=400%2C603&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="603" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Hypostyle Hall<br />© Jochem D. Wijnands/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>
<p>A hypostyle hall is a space with a roof that gains its support through columns. It was the <strong>first hall in history</strong> and has 134 columns made from sandstone. Most of the columns are 22 feet high, except for the  twelve columns in the centre measuring 62 feet tall. This allows for <strong>clerestory lighting</strong> or light to filter in from outside. Illumination before electricity!</p>
<p>Columns had smooth shafts, that were used to decorate and were brightly painted, with two different <strong>capitals, </strong>both bud and flower shaped<strong>.  </strong>Columns in hypostyle hall represent the dense clusters of reeds of the Nile, decorated like lotus, papyrus, and palm plants. Statues of gods and kings stood amongst the hypostyle columns.</p>
<p>The hall has a<strong> corridor axis </strong>or central path that runs downs the temple. A rear sanctuary included a side room and central shrine.</p>
<h5><strong>More Interior Art with a Theme</strong></h5>
<p>Relief carvings occur all over the site. The theme carries the same message.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pharaohs possessed divinely granted power to maintain order on earth.</li>
<li>The pharaohs were pious and dutiful worshippers of gods.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Display of Status</strong></h5>
<p>Ordinary people could only go as far as the interior courtyard. They could not even get to hypostyle hall. Egyptian priests and royalty were the only ones who could go beyond.</p>
<h5><strong>Lightness and Darkness</strong></h5>
<p>The space becomes progressively darker moving from the courtyard, to shadowed hypostyle hall, to a darkened central shrine. This symbolized the belief that the deities reside in darkness. It was known to be both magical and mysterious.</p>
<h5><strong>Egyptian Beliefs</strong></h5>
<p>Egyptians believed that the gods became exhausted each year. This required fresh offerings. An annual festival lasting 27 days replenished the gods.</p>
<p>Temples were the gods’ home on earth. Visiting a temple was the equivalent of being in the home of the divine presence. Since the gods were alive, they were given food, drink, incense, and oils daily.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Egyptian Museum in Berlin</p>
<p><strong><em>Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and three daughters</em></strong> is a sunken relief, <strong>limestone</strong> carving, that is <strong>one foot tall</strong>. This work of art would have been a private alter in a domestic home.</p>
<p>The pharaoh sits holding one of their daughters, with Queen Nefertiti beside him.  Two of their daughters sit with her, with one of her left and the other on her right shoulder. It is a domestic scene of informality.</p>
<p>All have stylized swollen bellies, long thin arms, and elongated heads. A traditional composite view of the bodies show a <strong>twisted perspective</strong>. The children are nude with shaved heads which were the custom of the time.</p>
<h5><strong>Androgyny</strong></h5>
<p>The bodies exhibit an <strong>androgyny</strong> of indeterminate gender. Many historians believe Aton, or the sun, who they worshipped, was believed to be both male and female. If Akhenaton was the son of the sun, then he must be dominated by both genders as well. Hence the look of androgyny!</p>
<p>Thus, this new shift had to reflect the idea that Akhenaton was both genders and wanted to distinguish this new art from Egypt’s past.</p>
<h5><strong>The Chosen Couple</strong></h5>
<p>Above them the rays of God Aton shine down. A cobra is embedded in the sunshine symbolizing that Aton is the one true God.  The sun’s rays end in <strong>ankhs</strong>, that give the king and queen the breath of life. The queen’s throne is decorated with lotus flowers, which symbolizes the unification of Egypt. <strong>Hieroglyphics</strong> on the top and around the figures explain the worship to Aton.</p>
<h5><strong>Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>This work signifies a style break in art, as Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten, who ruled from 1353- 1336 BCE changed the religion and started to worship God Aten.</p>
<p>Pharaoh Amenhotep IV abandoned the worship of the Egyptian gods in favor of Aton, whom he declared to be universal and only god, identified with the sun.  He changed his name to be Akhenaton (“Aton is pleased”). He had the names and images of other gods from temples defaced.</p>
<p>There were no priests  in this new religion. Akhenaton was Aten’s son and his representative on earth.</p>

<p>This work <strong>painted on papyrus scroll</strong> is from the <em>Book of the Dead</em>. It was found inside <strong>Hu-Nefer’s tomb</strong> and measures <strong>11 by 17 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Reading this Work</strong></h5>
<p>It reads from left to right and functioned as a type of witness statement to the character of the deceased. Originally, it was placed only in the tomb of dead kings, but later those of high rank were also included. In this case, it was for a scribe, that because of the profession’s talent in writing, were given a priestly status.</p>
<p>It depicts a scene of judgement complete with text and pictorial images. Only those with good ethics were deemed worthy to go into the afterlife. These images include gods and deities, and symbols of the afterlife such as lotus flowers and anks. There is a formality of stance, with traditional shaped bodies, and a twisted perspective. The text functions around the images and acts as a caption explaining the theme.</p>
<h5><strong>Created for Hu-Nefer</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created especially for the patron <strong>Hu-Neufer, </strong>who was<strong> a royal scribe to Seti</strong>.  He holds the hand of Anubis, the god of embalming, with a jackal’s head, who leads him into a hall where his hands are being weighed against a feather. If his soul is heavier than a feather, he would be sent to the underworld. Here Ammit, the hippo/lion/crocodile eats the soul of the dead.</p>
<p>The god Thoth, with the head of an ibis bird, records who gets to move forward in the book of life.  The god Horus, with the head of a falcon, presents Hu-Nefer to Osiris, the god of the underworld, who is enthroned on the right. At the top, Hu-Nefer pleads his case to 42 judges. This is artistically simplified to 14.</p>

<p>These winged bulls, with heads of men, known as <strong>lamassu</strong>, were <strong>each carved from one alabaster stone</strong>. These massive sculptures, each <strong>10 to 14 feet tall</strong> were guardian figures at the citadel fortress protecting the town, <strong>Dur Sharrukin,</strong> in what is now modern <strong>Khorsabad, Iraq</strong>.</p>
<p>These works were an expression of grandeur by Sargon II, meant to ward off enemies, both real and invisible or <strong>apotropaic</strong>.  The huge palace complex had 200 rooms with 30 different courtyards. Much of the artwork inside showed narrative scenes of Sargon in warfare and hunts.</p>
<h5><strong>Details of the Lamassu</strong></h5>
<p>The highly decorative lamassu were made to be viewed both from the front and from the side.  Parts are carved in <strong>high relief</strong> and parts in <strong>low relief</strong>.</p>
<p>The crown upon the head of each lamassu contains rosettes and double horns, along with a ring of feathers along the top. The human face contains a unibrow. The wavy hair and beard form ringlets and spirals. The only part of the face that is not human are the ears. These are the ears of a bull, with earrings that dangle down.</p>
<p>Under the body and around the legs are inscriptions in <strong>cuneiform</strong>, one of the first forms of writing in the world.  This declares the power of the king and threatens anyone who fails to acknowledge this.</p>
<p>The legs are a trick to the eye. There are five legs per sculpture. Viewed from the front there are only two, as if the creature is standing guard.  There are four when you enter, as if the animal moves to let you in!</p>

<p>The <strong>Athenian Agora</strong>, located in <strong>Athens, Greece</strong>, was a public space, in a flat low area, with a rocky Acropolis nearby. It was traversed by an ancient roadway called <strong>Panathenaic way </strong>and held various purposes making it the most important space, in Athens at that time. It was used for dramatic performances, cultural or religious events. Through evidence of shops and pieces of pottery, bronzeware and sculptor found at the site, it was also used as a market.</p>
<p>There was also a council’s chamber, magistrate’s office, mint, and archive. The Athenian agora where public elections were had and a place of experimentation in Athenian democracy.</p>
<h5><strong>Panathenaic Procession</strong></h5>
<p>Most buildings were “outlined” with <strong>stoas.</strong> This was a covered walkway or portico, typically with Doric order. It helped to define the edges of the building and were used as a framing device.</p>
<p>Agora was the main site of a festival, held every four years, called the <strong>Panathenaic Procession </strong>to honor the goddess, Athena. Processions marched across the Agora at a diagonal and culminated on the Acropolis. The culmination of the ceremony was a new woven <strong>peplos </strong>(robe) that was sewn for Athena’s cult statue, in the Parthenon.</p>
<h5><strong>Persian Destruction of Athens</strong></h5>
<p>In 480 BCE, the Persians destroyed Athens. Building had to be rebuilt or reconstructed.  Many more were added to accommodate the Athenian democracy.</p>

<p>A <strong>peplos</strong> is a Greek costume that is made from a rectangular cloth that is pinned at the shoulders. A <strong>kore </strong>is a clothed female figure. This work is <strong>four feet tall</strong> and <strong>made from marble </strong>that was once <strong>painted.</strong> It was <strong>found at the Acropolis, in Athens, Greece.  </strong></p>
<p>The work has similar characteristics to other archaic kores. There is the archaic smile that signifies well-being and considered transcendent. It is immobile, with arms by the side.</p>
<p>Her clothing is different than other similar figures that were left as offerings to the goddess Athena, at the Acropolis. Under special light, one can detect painting and patterns on her costume. There were patterns of small animals painted vertically down the center of her dress.</p>
<h5><strong>Is Peplos Kore Really Artemis?</strong></h5>
<p>Upon further inspection there has been conjecture that the figure is not a simple woman but the goddess <strong>Artemis</strong>.  The goddess that was later called Diana, by the Romans and was known as the goddess of the hunt.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that she was once carrying a crossbow, as her left arm is bent at the elbow. The right hand is closed in a fist, that may have held an arrow.</p>
<p>This sculpture, goddess or not, is considered one of the best examples of <strong>sculpture from the archaic period. </strong></p>

<p>This masterwork is an anthropoid, or human-shaped <strong>painted terracotta</strong> <strong>sarcophagus found in the ancient Etruscan city of Caere now Cerveteri, Italy</strong>.  It measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches</strong> in length.</p>
<h5><strong>Purpose for Creation</strong></h5>
<p>This was a sarcophagus for a married couple. The ashes were placed inside.  The size of the sarcophagus was a symbol of status.</p>
<h5><strong>Depiction and Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>In the <strong>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</strong> a couple reclines on a dining couch, eating and drinking.  This was how funerals were ritualized in Etruscan society. A funeral banquet, including male and female guests, was the way of sending the deceased off to the afterlife.</p>
<p>Both the man and woman in the artwork hold objects that were related to a banquet.  A pomegranate was the symbol of eternal life or an egg, the symbol of regeneration.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Efforts</strong></h5>
<p>The Caertan sarcophagus took a great deal of time to create this detailed piece. The rounded faces, have archaic smiles, and hairstyles that are Greek in nature. The angular composition of the bodies however was a Estruscan. Looking closely, you will notice the soft cap on the woman’s head, along with the pointed shoes.</p>
<p>The great size meant that it needed to be fired multiple times.</p>
<h5><strong>Women in Society</strong></h5>
<p>This piece reflects the high standing of women in Etruscan society. Women were not allowed to dine with men in Ancient Greece.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>While the work would have originally included the cremated remains of the deceased, the remains of the individuals is unknown. Historians agree that it belonged to members of the elite.</p>

<p>This Etruscan chamber tomb dates to 470 BCE and is in the necropolis of <strong>Tarquinia, Italy</strong> known in ancient times as <em>Tarquinii</em> or <em>Tarch(u)na</em>). The subterranean rock cut tomb, cut out of local <strong>tufa</strong> was made for both the deceased and grave goods.</p>
<p><strong>Tumulus</strong> were large burial mounds in Etruscan architecture that were part of necropolis  Sometimes they reached colossal sizes of over 130 feet across.</p>
<h5><strong>The Fresco</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>fresco</strong> decorated wall have a focus the banquet scene in the center. Figures are reclining on dining couches or klinai. The guests are dressed in colourful robes and being waited on by attendants. There are birds in the artwork and a cat. The left and right walls depict dancing and musicians.  The ceiling is also painted in a checkerboard pattern, depicting the tents that were temporarily erected for these events.</p>
<p>Note the skin colorations which were typical of the time in Etruscan art. The women have white skin, while the men have orange brown.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>The Etruscans did not leave written records, so most of our knowledge comes from tombs and depictions of their lives. Funerals were seen as a transition from one realm to the next.  These were not sorrowful affairs, but festive.</p>

<p>The<strong> Niobides Krater, </strong>is by the artist known only as the <strong>Niobid Painter.</strong> This is a <strong>clay </strong>work. Using <strong>red- figure technique with white highlights</strong>. It stands <strong>two feet tall</strong> and was found in necropolis <strong>Crucfissio Del Tufo in Orvieto, Italy</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Calyx-krater? </strong></h5>
<p>A<strong> Calyx-krater</strong> is a punch bowl, with two handles on the side. It was used to mix the overly strong wine with water. It is classified within the <strong>decorative arts</strong>, meaning it is both beautiful and functional. Greek vases are described using human anatomical parts. You will hear phrases to describe vases such as <strong>wide mouth</strong>, handles on the base of the <strong>body</strong>, or <strong>wide foot</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the Images</strong></h5>
<p>On one side of the Greek vase, directly in the centre of the krater is the god Hercules, who is identifiable by the club and lion skin he carries. Around him are warriors, looking for his blessing before leaving for battle. (Image shown above)</p>
<p>On the back on the krater is the story of the mortal Niobe. She bragged that her seven daughters and seven sons were more beautiful than the those of the goddess Letos. The goddess’ two children, Apollo, the god of arts and music, as well as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt extract revenge on the children by shooting and killing them with bows and arrows.</p>

<p>Although the artist may have been aiming for a sense of depth by depicting the figures at various height, but all are the same size. The figures are also very stiff and unnatural, as was the style of the time.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Niobides Krater </strong> was found in an Etruscan tomb. The Etruscans were Grecophiles. Greek vases were tremendously popular, with many designs and functions available. The more decorative, the greater the expense.</p>

<p>This <strong>marble and paint </strong>stele, at <strong>5 feet tall</strong>,  was crafted to represent the life of a wealthy woman named Hegeso. She is seated on a chair, as her servant presents her with an opened box of jewelry. What the piece was is unclear, as it was painted into Hegeso’s hands and not carved. The image has long since disappeared.</p>
<p>The gown she is wearing is tight against her figure, as the fabric, swirls, and drapes intricately, given the artist the ability to show a mastery of skills. Gentle scenes such as this one were often selected to show the refinery of the woman who had passed away.</p>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>During the Greek Archaic period, <strong>kouros</strong> and <strong>kore</strong> were used as grave markers. Later all efforts were put into great public buildings like the Pantheon. During the fifth century BCE a <strong>grave stele</strong> or marker started to gain popularity.</p>
<p>This is a good example of private sculpture and not part of a state commission like Parthenon. It illustrates the greater statue of free-born women, with a servants and jewelry. Yet, this was still a restrictive life. Women’s sphere was in the home, hence the domestic setting.</p>
<p>Women were not considered citizens and were defined by their relationships to men. Who they were the daughter of or wife of was of great importance.</p>

<p>This<strong> marble </strong>work was built on the <strong>Pergamon</strong> <strong>acropolis</strong>, 800 feet above the city below and about 20 miles from the coast. It was once part of Greece, but today is Turkey.  A panorama of nature was a dramatic background to the action in the altar that measures <strong>117 by 109 feet.</strong></p>
<p>Pergamon was the capital of Attalid Kingdom (Asia Minor). This was one of the four breakup kingdoms from Alexander the Great’s large empire. Today, it is part of Turkey.</p>
<h5><strong>The Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>The temple was an enclosed courtyard with two sides extending out into arms, with an iconic <strong>colonnade.</strong> It also has <strong>acroteria</strong> or sculptures in the round placed on a roof. A <strong>frieze</strong> measuring 7 and a half feet high over 400 feet long wraps around the entire monument.  The temple was on a massive podium with a large flight of stairs, verticality toward the heavens.</p>
<p>Surrounding it was a great library, a garrison for soldiers and a royal palace for the king.  Of course, a fire would have been lit in the centre for the gods.</p>

<p>The gods drag them, literally, up the actual physical stairs to show that they will be made to worship to Zeus. Sculptural elements protract outward and use each stair as resting places.</p>
<h5><strong>In Detail</strong></h5>
<p>Hellenistic art began after the death of Alexander the Great. The Hellenistic qualities of this work includes energy; dynamism; movement; emotion; height of the narrative.  Hellenistic sculpture rejects the rationalism of the Classical era, but retains the idealism of the Classical era, characterized by exaggerated forms, dynamic poses, emotional drama.  This is a <strong>high relief</strong> frieze, with deeply carved figures, that creates shadows and bursts of light.  There are over 100 figures, all of which would have been vividly painted.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work built by Eumenes II, commemorating the defeat of invading Gauls, led by King Attalos in 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE. It is dedicated to and honors Zeus.</p>
<p>It also has parelells to Pergamon victories over the Barbarians (Gauls) in 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE, as well as Alexander the Great’s defeat of the Persians.</p>
<p>This made a clear statement about Greek victories not only against other culture, but of the unknown. It also established a patriarchal culture with Zeus winning over Gaia.</p>
<p>Animals were sacrificed inside the main temple complex on feast days/festivals.</p>
<h5><strong>Today</strong></h5>
<p>Altar was removed from Pergamon in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by a German archaeologist. It was then reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum, in Berlin</p>

<p>This <strong>mosaic</strong> made from over a million and a half tiny pieces of glass and stone, known as <strong>tesserae</strong> . The work measures <strong>8 feet 11 inches by 16 feet 9 inches </strong>exhibits a naturalistic style. It exhibits radical <strong>foreshortening</strong>, or extension perpendicular to the picture plane, into the deep, painted space. Figures are not stacked but turned into picture plane.   The <strong>tesserae</strong> show <strong>modeling</strong>, or use of light and dark to create shadow, which conveys a roundness of form.</p>
<h5><strong>Made for Home</strong></h5>
<p>The work was found between two courtyards in the most extravagant mansion, called House of Faun, in Pompei. It was preserved in the ash of the Eruption of Mount Vesuvious.</p>
<p>This floor was the first thing a visitor would see upon entering the foyer of the home.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting the Scene</strong></h5>
<p>In the Alexander mosaic a fearful Darius on the left has just told his soldier to flee. He has spun his chariot around, well his soldiers have yet to lower their spears to the Greeks. Many Persians are wounded. One on the ground sees his own reflection in his armour before he starts to die.</p>

<p>On the right Alexander remains triumphant. In his time, the great leader managed not only to unify Greece, but also moved into parts of Egypt, east into Persia and into Induus Valley.</p>
<h5><strong>Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>It depicts the battle between the Greek and Alexander the Great and the Persians and Darius III. Literature from that time claims the work is a replica of a Greek painting, yet paintings from this time have never been found.</p>
<p>It displays the Romans love for Greek works, but also an interest in Alexander. Although he died at the age of 32, he was considered a great leader.</p>

<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Athlete<br />
Ideal male<br />
Psychological</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> National Museum, Rome</p>
<p>This work is a <strong>bronze sculpture</strong> which measures four feet six inches.  In this work <strong>the artist added copper</strong> to show the red wounds of the boxer. While his body is still muscular, years of abuse in the sport show a broken nose, wounds, and a swollen ear.</p>
<p>The artist wants the viewer to be captured by the emotion of the sculpture. The man is exhausted, his posture is stooped.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Perspective</strong></h5>
<p>This work was originally placed in Baths of Diocletian and may have been part of a larger group of works. It is from Hellenistic period, after Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Sculptures of this time frame differed from classical works. The subjects moved from young, perfect images of the ideal and the heroic to more realistic images. After this period, the Romans conquered Greece and expensive bronze was melted down. Sculptures were then made with marble. This is a rare piece of art.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pantheon in Rome, Italy,</strong> is an impressive structure measuring  <strong>142 feet high by  142’ feet wide.</strong></p>
<p>Originally set in a rectangular courtyard, it the <strong>concrete with stone facing</strong> structure was framed by a colonnade. Only the front of the building would have been visible, with its impressive columns. These massive columns are made from <strong>marble</strong> imported from Egypt and formed form one piece. At the top are gigantic fragments that were once made of marble Corinthian capitals.</p>
<h5><strong>Architectural Terms</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-259" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Inside.jpg?resize=500%2C710&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="710" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Inside.jpg?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Inside.jpg?w=229&amp;ssl=1 229w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259" class="wp-caption-text">Pantheon<br />© Vanni Archive/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The structure of the entire building relies on something the Romans were masters of. That is <strong>concrete</strong>. Here thick barrels of concrete are used. The walls concrete mixed with basalt, a hard stone. These walls are 20 feet thick at the base. The dome or <strong>cupola</strong> was concrete with pumice for a lighter ceiling. A <strong>coffered</strong> ceiling helps to make the dome lighter.</p>
<p>The building interior is a <strong>radial</strong> style. This means the focus is on a central point which radiate out. A shape of a sphere would fill the interior. In fact, the interior is comprised with an obsession toward perfect geometry like circles, rectangles, and squares.  Decorative marble, imported from the far reaches of the Roman Empire adds colour in purple, orange, and blue.</p>
<p>There is on <strong>oculus</strong>, or circle cut into the ceiling that measures 27 feet across. This acts like a sundial. As the sun shines in it illuminates various parts of the building. No, the window does not contain glass. when it rains the floor gets wet.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dedication to the Gods</strong></h5>
<p>Hadrian’s temple was dedicated to all the gods but particularly, twelve main gods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zeus (sky)</li>
<li>Hera (marriage, mothers, families)</li>
<li>Poseidon (sea)</li>
<li>Demeter (agriculture)</li>
<li>Athena (wisdom and war)</li>
<li>Hephaestus (blacksmiths, fire)</li>
<li>Ares (war)</li>
<li>Aphrodite (love and beauty),</li>
<li>Apollo (music, poetry, medicine, sun),</li>
<li>Artemis (moon, hunt, maidens),</li>
<li>Hermes (roadways, travelers),</li>
<li>Dionysus (wine)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>The first monument on the site, was built by Marcus Agrippa to show Rome’s power over Antony and Cleopatra. After a fire, it was destroyed.  Then, the pantheon was built for Roman emperor Hadrian. Some say, it was a copy of the original. Others say the second building was not built by Hadrian, but that he inherited the construction near the end and took credit.</p>
<p>What started out as a temple of the gods, held statures of gods, goddesses, and emperors. Later it was turned into a church. Today it is a popular tourist attraction.</p>
<p>Today it is one of the most copied architecture ever created. It is also one of the best preserved ancient Roman Monuments.</p>
<h5><strong>A New Theory </strong></h5>
<p>Today, historians think that Hadrian might have not used the Pantheon as temple at all, but rather a kind of monument to Roman emperors and political power. Many think it was his statement of humility to previous emperors.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Museo Nazionale Romano – Palazzo Altemps, Rome</p>
<p>This <strong>marble</strong> sarcophagus is a highly intricate work carved in <strong>deep relief</strong>, using a hand drill. The work stands <strong>5 feet tall</strong>.</p>
<p>The Romans are depicted in classic style, which attractive features, while the Barbarians appear gargoyle like.  The work itself is not classical, but highly chaotic. People, armour, and horses are piles deeply on top of one another. There is not a single clean space. The images at the bottom are smaller as if crushed down by the weight of the others.</p>
<p>The hero is in the center with arms outreached welcoming victory.</p>
<p>It is unclear who was buried in this sarcophagus. Judging by the amount of work that would have taken for the artist to create the work, historians assume the diseased was a member of the elite classes.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This sarcophagus was discovered in 1621 in a tomb near the Porta Tiburtina, in Rome, and purchased by Cardinal Ludovisi, hence the name.</p>
<p>Christians were still being persecuted in the Roman Empire. They were not accepted until the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE. Constantine’s Edict of Milan where Christianity was officially a tolerated religion.</p>
<p>Burials occurred in underground chambers called <strong>catacombs. </strong>Openings called <strong>loculi</strong> were cut into walls to hold the dead and to hold <strong>sarcophagi</strong>.</p>
<p>Christians found cremation repugnant and preferred burials. They felt they needed their bodies during the end times, when Christ would raise the good and the dead to fight the devil.</p>
<p>Many wealthy Romans began to adopt the practice of saving the body rather than using cremation.</p>
