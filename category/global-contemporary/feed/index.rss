<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at Global Contemporary Art in this two part gallery.</p>
<h3>PART ONE</h3>
<h5><strong>Contemplative Gateways</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>advancement of technology</strong> has impacted the construction, display, documentation, and cross-cultural transmission of art and architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Site-specific artworks</strong> allow viewers to interact with the art while their impermanence creates a time-specific accessibility, prompting the contemplation of the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Digital media</strong> allows viewers to access to the art after it is destroyed or no longer displayed, but the experience of and participation in the work is limited to the time it is displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude</strong>, a husband-and-wife team, began creating <strong>site-specific works</strong> in the 1960s. Their intention was to make the viewer aware of spaces and their aesthetic impact by concealing or reframing familiar environments. Not permanent, their works were installed for three to four weeks and live on only through documentation. Refusing government funding, Christo and Jeanne-Claude financed their projects through advance sales of photographs and preliminary drawings. A repeated aesthetic argument about their work is if the site being visited or the later images of it constitute their art.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2454" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=612%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="612" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Christo and Jeanne-Claude developed their concept for <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> in 1979 and were inspired by the human scale, the flow of people walking through the streets of New York, and the tradition of Japanese torii gates. The proposal was initially denied in 1981, but permission was later granted in 2003.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2451" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-1.jpg?w=413&amp;ssl=1 413w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2453" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Exhibited from February 12 to February 27, 2005, <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> consisted of 7,503 gates that were 16 feet tall with 6-foot, free-hanging saffron-colored fabric. The artists intended the gates to appear like a golden river becoming visible through the bare branches of the trees in Central Park, emphasizing the organic and serpentine design of the walkways while the rectangular poles reminded the viewer of the grid pattern of the city blocks around the park.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2455" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-one-legged-tori-at-the-Sanno-Shrine.-Nagasaki-Japan..jpg?resize=422%2C668&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="422" height="668" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-one-legged-tori-at-the-Sanno-Shrine.-Nagasaki-Japan..jpg?w=278&amp;ssl=1 278w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-one-legged-tori-at-the-Sanno-Shrine.-Nagasaki-Japan..jpg?resize=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1 190w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The one-legged tori at the Sann</em><em>ō Shrine</em>. Nagasaki, Japan</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> took a form similar to and were <strong>inspired by Japanese torii gates</strong>, which are found at the entrance of Shinto shrines, like the Sannō Shrine, marking the transition from the unsacred to the sacred. In comparison to the <strong><em>Spiral Jetty</em></strong>, whose presentation changed but is still available in some form for viewers to participate in and experience, the presentation of <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> can be seen only through photographs since the exhibition concluded.</p>
<h5><strong>Contemplative Remembrance</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Monuments of remembrance</strong> often took the form of heroic images of the fallen or large, imposing obelisks or columns inspired by triumphal works. Rejecting the precedent of these earlier monuments, <strong>Maya Lin’s design</strong> for the <strong>Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C</strong>., was of a <strong>Minimalist</strong> monument, where the names of the fallen take precedence over representative imagery. This lack of excess embellishment concentrates on remembering rather than representing those who died.</p>
<p>Lin drew on the language of Minimalism to create the memorial, constructing two simple walls of reflective black gabbro stone that meet to make an obtuse angle. Lin cut into the earth to allow visitors to descend along a walkway which, in Minimalist fashion, enables viewers to interact with the work and the terrain. Viewers engage with the names of the deceased, which are inscribed on the wall that rises alongside the walkway.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em>. Washington, D.C., U.S. Maya Lin. 1982 C.E. Granite.</strong></p>
<p>Lin&#8217;s representation is of an open healing wound, symbolizing the continual healing process of the individual and the country.</p>
<p><strong>To create a narrative</strong>, the names of the fallen are recorded in the order in which they died. The act of finding a name and taking in the position of a deceased loved one’s name while seeing one’s own face reflected was intended as an opportunity for viewers to personalize the experience. Here they can reflect on the war and its costs and see themselves within the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2457" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial.-2.jpg?resize=704%2C464&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="704" height="464" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial.-2.jpg?w=704&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial.-2.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em>. Washington, D.C., U.S. Maya Lin. 1982 C.E. Granite.</strong></p>
<p>Lin’s untraditional design was controversial, in a similar fashion to Rodin’s <strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong> in placement and figural representation. This controversy was compounded after it was revealed that Lin was Asian American. This is ironic, as the monument was intended to remember soldiers who died in the war in Vietnam, a country in Asia. The memorial lacks the figurative ornamentation normally expected in memorials and is submerged in the ground instead of rising vertically.</p>
<h5><strong>Writing on the Wall</strong></h5>
<p>Artworks like Rivera’s <strong><em>Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Park</em></strong> challenge societal restrictions and are commentaries on social injustice. These themes are continued in the <strong>Neo-Expressionist</strong> movement.</p>
<p>Like the German Expressionists of the early 20th century, <strong>Neo-Expressionists portrayed recognizable objects, especially the human figure, in a violent and emotional</strong> way using vivid colors that had been rejected by previous art movements.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong> was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Haitian father and a Puerto Rican mother. His teenage years were marked by trouble, including his parents’ divorce and a car accident that resulted in several injuries.</p>
<p>He ran away from home at the age of 15 and dropped out of high school. His father disinherited him as a result, and he spent the rest of his teen years living on the streets of New York. His earliest involvement with the art world was as a street artist, but he soon moved from graffiti and subway art into a Neo-Expressionist style that sought to translate the images and experiences of black America to a high-art setting and audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2458" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/226-Horn-Players.jpg?resize=510%2C651&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="510" height="651" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em>. Jean-Michel Basquiat. 1983 C.E. Acrylic and oil paintstick on three canvas panels.</strong></p>
<p>Basquiat’s work <strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> celebrates legendary jazz musicians Charlie “Bird” Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Basquiat represents the musicians with fractured figures and boldly colored graffiti-like words on a black background. This is suggestive of the rhythms of jazz music and the excitement of New York City. Horn Players challenged societal restrictions and the definition of art. Using jazz, which originated in African American communities, Basquiat connects societal symbols of black America for high-art audiences, underscoring the significant contributions of African American communities.</p>
<h4><strong>Revival</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The prefix “neo” at the beginning of a word indicates a revival</strong> of or a new form of the word it precedes. In this case, it is both. <strong>Graffiti in Neo-Expressionism</strong> and Basquiat’s work is a revival of Expressionism. It took the social commentary and expressed it with vivid colors in new ways and using graffiti as a platform. This then <strong>elevated graffiti as an art form</strong> and made it more accessible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Untitled</em></strong> is a powerful pictographic landscape in which Basquiat creates a mythical landscape composed of stick-like figures amid mystical symbols and mysterious marks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2460" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?resize=719%2C482&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="719" height="482" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The black male figures wear crowns, a component of his tag as a street artist, representative of their dignity and power.</p>
<p>He arms them with weapons, signifying that dignity and violence are complementary, a suggestion also made in the pictographic works of African tribal artists. Basquiat met Andy Warhol in 1982 and collaborated with him for several years after, resulting in a reciprocal boost to both careers, especially Warhol’s.</p>
<h5><strong>Graffiti</strong></h5>
<p>The use of <strong>graffiti has had a long and symbiotic relationship with degenerative, lowbrow art</strong>. The idea of painting or otherwise altering public property in the way street artists do is problematic in that it is technically illegal and is looked down on. However, the <strong>public and subversive nature of street art is part of its character</strong> and appeals to artists.</p>
<p>Banksy, pseudonym of an anonymous British street artist, exemplifies the degree of public showmanship necessary in the graffiti-art tradition pioneered by Basquiat. Banksy has even been caught on security cameras hanging his own work in the Louvre, which people then believed was supposed to be there.</p>

<p><strong><em>Urban Art</em>. Banksy (pseudonym). Lower 9th Ward, New Orleans, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>In locations throughout the globe, he has created images that express wry political or social commentary; his pseudonym is indicative of his anonymity, despite his fame.</p>
<p>A significant commentary on the high-art view and illegal nature of graffiti—would cave paintings have been considered graffiti?</p>
<p>Banksy did a series of works in New Orleans in 2008 to commemorate the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. He created works on still-abandoned locations, like this filling station, where a flag-waving occupant of a rocking chair has been painted insouciantly below a spray-painted “NO LOITERING” notice. The New Orleans resident, an older man biding his time in his rocking chair, displays the U.S. flag, ironically commenting on the feeling that the federal government forsook New Orleans after Katrina.</p>
<h5><strong>Feminine Identity in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Questions of identity and broader cultural inclusion</strong> led artistic progression, prompting reflection on how artists reappropriate the past in new and innovative works. <strong>Gender roles and female identity in art</strong> characterized these artists’ searches for identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Ana Mendieta</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cuban-born Ana Mendieta labeled</strong> herself an <strong>Earth-Body sculptor</strong>, a type of Environmental artist. <strong><em>Arbol de la Vida (Mud,)</em></strong> part of the Silueta series, involves her body, or a silhouette of her body, photographed with mud, implying a physical and spiritual connection with the land, and expounding the female figure as an aspect of nature.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>impermanent but is documented in photography</strong>. Photographs of her work are displayed in galleries and sold as art.</p>
<p>Mendieta, who was sent to American foster homes as a 13-year-old to escape Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba, said of her Silueta series, &#8220;[I] carried on a dialogue between the landscape and the female body (based on my own silhouette). I believe this has been a direct result of my having been torn from my homeland during my adolescence.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2465" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arbol-de-la-Vida-Mud.jpg?resize=600%2C818&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="818" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Arbol de la Vida (Mud), from the Silueta series. Ana Mendieta. 1973–1977 C.E.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Her work is considered highly feminist by some and autobiographical by others. Violence against women is a common theme in her early works and was expanded to include violence against nature. The earth is compared to a nurturing female figure, like a mother, and the manipulation of the earth is interpreted as violence toward women.</p>
<h5><strong>Miriam Schapiro</strong></h5>
<p>Miriam Schapiro supported the legacy of female artists of the past and incorporated details from their art to reclaim the <strong>traditional “feminine craft” of textile and elevate it to “high art”.</strong></p>
<p>To call attention to the <strong>similarity between quilting and collage</strong>, Schapiro coined the term femmage to describe the fabric collages she created and establish textiles as a legitimate art form.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Conservatory: Portrait of Frida Kahlo</em></strong>, Schapiro inserts her features into an image of Kahlo, signifying Kahlo as a representative of herself and all female artists. She surrounds the figure with images of pots, flowers, and other objects traditionally related to the female form and role around her fictional depiction of Frida Kahlo, who is seated as a goddess in a painting that vaguely resembles one of Kahlo’s own works. Again this underscores Kahlo’s representation of all female artists.</p>

<p><strong>Conservatory: Portrait of Frida Kahlo. Miriam Schapiro. 1988 C.E. Acrylic, collage on canvas.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Faith Ringgold</strong></h5>
<p>A Harlem native, <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> produced many works that provided sharp <strong>commentary on racial prejudice and gender roles.</strong> Her series <strong><em>The French Collection</em></strong> uses fabric as the predominant material, enabling Ringgold to single out the domestic range primarily associated with women. <strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre </em></strong>is part of a fictional story about an African American artist struggling in 1920s Paris and highlights the bias in treatment of race and gender.</p>
<p>The main character, Willia Marie, is modeled after Ringgold’s mother. The specific moment of <strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre</em></strong> is inspired about an experience Ringgold had with her children when she took them to Paris to see the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>The paintings on the wall in the Louvre are all mothers and children, no men. This is significant as Ringgold is exerting her independence and power as an artist—she can represent who she wants.</p>
<p>Although she is painting a white, European location, she can portray African American females. It is the same idea with the characters dancing. There are no rules against dancing at the Louvre. Ringgold feels that the dancing occurred because the characters could dance, while other characters did not dance because they did not know how. It is not a matter of societal restrictions or boundaries, but of choice.</p>

<p><strong>The Guerrilla Girls </strong>take a far more sardonic approach to the situation of women in the modern world—specifically how it mirrors their treatment in the past, with little progress. The Guerrilla Girls, formed in New York in 1984, are <strong>a group of anonymous women</strong> who use the names of deceased women artists as pseudonyms and wear gorilla masks as they engage in “guerrilla” war tactics to call attention to inequalities in the art world related to race and sex. This reflects the attack on women resulting in them feeling as if they are at war with oppression.</p>
<p>Very little is known about them. They are <strong>careful to maintain their anonymity</strong>, not disclosing their membership or location due to fear of retaliation from the art world they are part of and attacking their own context to promote change within it. In addition to <strong>promoting equality in art</strong>, the Guerrilla Girls tackle a number of <strong>feminist issues—gender-based discrimination in the workplace, sexual abuse, and human rights.</strong></p>
<p>The group, which is still active, has published five books since 1995. Their actions include performance, public lectures, and the use of fliers and posters, such as the ironic poster, The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist. The propagandistic poster sarcastically lists the advantages women artists have, including “working without the pressure of success,” “seeing your ideas live on in the work of others,” and “not having to undergo the embarrassment of being called a genius.”</p>

<p>Another poster, <strong><em>Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?</em></strong> challenges the high number of nude women as the subjects of art in the Metropolitan Museum, while the number of actual female artists is low. This brings out the issues of the female form as solely a source for male pleasure.</p>

<h5><strong>Not-So-Feminine Identity in Art</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1775" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/236-En-la-Barberia-no-Llora-No-Crying-Allowed-in-the-Barbershop.jpg?resize=640%2C978&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="978" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop).</em> Pepon Osorio. 1994 C.E. Mixed media installation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pepon Osorio’s</strong> installation <em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop)</em> addresses the <strong>role of the barbershop in Latino culture</strong> and how it functioned as a rite of passage into Latino Masculinity.</p>
<p>Osorio explores the construction of Latino masculinity, or machismo.</p>
<p>This is especially significant as it brings out the expectations of men, both young and old. Young male volunteers posed in various masculine poses and were videoed, while older men were videoed discussing how machismo had shaped their lives. This emphasizes the lineage and generational connection that are brought out through the barbershop.</p>
<p>A building was <strong>painted to resemble a Puerto Rican barbershop</strong>, and inside, video monitors with no sound presented the Latino male body engaged in physical displays of masculinity like lifting weights or specific walks, while monitors in the windows played continuous videos of men crying. The walls and chair were <strong>decorated in symbols of masculinity</strong> like Latino athletes and entertainers, pushing the viewer to address the cultural expectations of Latino men, where young boys are told not to cry, in a space where the female is not allowed.</p>
<h5><strong>Organic Portrayals</strong></h5>
<p>A Polish sculptor and fiber artist, <strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz</strong> explores the expressive powers of weaving techniques, a mostly feminine art form, in large-scale artworks. Abakanowicz’s sculptures reflect her early life experiences under Nazi rule.</p>
<p>The change, dislocation, devastation, and poverty she experienced is conveyed in a large-scale, anonymous way so that anyone can see himself or herself in the work.</p>
<p>The use of <strong>fiber materials is symbolic for Abakanowicz</strong>—she views fiber as the basic element and building block of the organic world. Her work, Androgyne III, represents the torso, arms, and upper legs of a human body sitting on a wooden, ladder-like bench. It appears as a hollow shell and incomplete from the front, expressing the physical and spiritual condition of humanity and suggesting meditation, submission, and anticipation. The back is fully formed, representing the truth. The use of fiber shows the androgynous nature of the cellular makeup of the human body along with its connection to the earth.</p>
<p>In contrast with Abakanowicz’s <strong><em>Androgyne III</em></strong>, Wangechi Mutu’s <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong>, as seen in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description, portrays the human form camouflaged by nature. The title alludes to the praying mantis, a predator insect that is typically green or brown and utilizes camouflage to allow it to ambush its prey. The adult female praying mantis will often eat her mate just after or during mating. The African female body is portrayed with machine-like features, including a cyborg-like eye and un-humanlike skin that appears to reflect the environment, giving an illusion of oneness with nature portrayed not as connection, but as subversion.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross-Cultural Reaction</strong></h5>
<p>Artists in regions that have been colonized and exploited by Euro-ethnic powers for economic gains are impacted by the resulting cross-cultural fertilization. The resulting <strong>artworks incorporate found objects and comment on the human and environmental costs of the exploitation.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Indigenous Americas</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith</strong> uses visual language to represent her investigation of the experience and assumptions related to Native American culture. <strong><em>Indian, Indio, Indigenous</em></strong> is a collaged work that evokes the mistreatment of both Native Americans and their land. The work is a symbolic landscape full of images that include George Catlin’s images of American Indians, a U.S. map, and pictographs of a bear, coyote, and deer.</p>
<p>These images, which are meant to both educate viewers and be perceived by them through their own experiences, coexist with patches of black and white paint and fabric, slashed and punctuated with red marks and the title phrase in blood-red. The canvas includes phrases &#8220;it takes hard work to keep racism alive&#8221; and &#8220;money is green: it takes precedence over nature”, linking racial discrimination and injustice with misuse of the environment.</p>
<p>Smith’s <strong><em>Trade (Gifts for Trading Land with White People)</em></strong> is a complex multimedia work that combines clippings from Native American newspapers, images chronicling the conquest of Native America by Europeans, and objects like Native American artifacts and contemporary sports memorabilia from teams with American Indian-derived names, including a hat from the Atlanta Braves and Red Man chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>Smith uses paint to comment on the implications of colonization of the Americans by European countries by having the canvas transition to red as the work progresses to the right, symbolizing the deaths of Native Americans in the conquest of the Americas and Mexico.</p>

<h5><strong>The Pacific</strong></h5>
<p>New Zealand artist <strong>Michel Tuffery</strong> comments on how imported product has replaced local Pacific Island foods used in feasts and gift giving in his artwork <strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000).</em></strong> The term<strong> pisupo</strong> is used for canned food items in the Pacific, derived from pea-soup-o.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, pisupo has been a demanded food item eaten and gifted at feasts, weddings, funerals, and other special occasions in Samoan society. Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000), a sculpture of a bull made from flattened corned beef tins joined together with rivets, is a comment on how the imported item has become a staple and an integral part of Polynesian customs.</p>

<h5><strong>Africa</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>artist El Anatsui</strong> found the emphasis on Western traditions irrelevant, and Ghana’s own work ignored as he studied art in Kumasi. El Anatsui began to create a large body of work inspired by uli, an Igbo surface design system.</p>
<p>While very concerned with the survival and transmission of inherited traditions, Anatsui began to appropriate cast-off objects found in and around where he lives and using them to create immense wall sculptures that fold and wave like textiles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> is constructed from flattened liquor bottle labels fastened together with copper wire and alludes to the alcohol used as trade for slaves, exemplifying the connection between Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>El Anatsui discusses this: &#8220;Drinks played an important role in the relation between Europe and Africa. While engaging in trade, drinks were among items brought. This is like working with history in a sense. This was a point of contact between two countries.&#8221;</p>

<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Global Contemporary art</strong> is used as social commentary and explores cultural, political, racial, and gender roles, along with exploring cross-cultural impact. Environmental installations and site-specific art enable viewers to interact with artworks, but only for a limited time. Art not only records and represents historical events, but it is used as propaganda to comment on social and cultural injustice to change the current cultural climate.</p>

<h3>GLOBAL CONTEMPORARY ART GALLERY</h3>
<h3>PART TWO</h3>
<h5><strong>Man, Machine, and Global Culture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Digital and video technology media</strong> serve as new vehicles for installation pieces within Contemporary art.</p>
<p><strong>Nam June Paik’s</strong> family immigrated to the United States in 1950 due to the Korean War. His immigration coincided with events causing significant transformation of American culture: the construction of interstate highways, the popularization of television in homes, and the development of the first portable video camera. <strong>Paik pioneered the use of video as a primary medium the 1960s</strong>. Paik’s use of video makes a statement about the importance of television in our culture.</p>
<p>Paik employed <strong>music, performance, and video in many of his early works</strong>, arguing new technology would supersede painting and sculpture.</p>
<p>Paik’s sculptures’ incorporation of television sets playing video images&#8211;as both a modus operandi for his preferred medium and a representation of television’s place in popular culture&#8211; has continued in his body of work. <strong><em>Phiber Optik</em></strong> exemplifies a common theme in Paik’s work, the melding of humanity and technology. A robot-like figure composed of television sets sits astride a motorcycle, combining traditional art with the new art that Paik pioneers. Unifying man and machine, <strong><em>Phiber Optik</em></strong> is a visual representation of one of the first teenage hackers, Mark Abene. <strong><em>Phiber Optik</em></strong> was Abene’s handle and represented his online identity, and the work functions as a symbol of the blending of personas, one real and one digital.</p>
<p>Paik’s site-specific sculpture <strong><em>Electronic Superhighway</em></strong> can be seen in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description. It is a statement about the prevalence and power of the mixed messages transmitted by television in our society and the cultural connection formed by highways.</p>
<p>The work is a neon outline map of the United States set against a wall of several computer-controlled video monitors. This neon references highway scenery and motel signs. Each monitor displays rapidly changing soundtracked images that reflect each state’s culture and history, and in the case of New York, includes viewers in the work by showing their video image as they are viewing it. While Paik dismissed painting as passé, his intention of involving the viewer in the work harks back to da Vinci’s the <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong> and di Bondone’s <strong><em>Lamentation.</em></strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2579" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Phiber-Optik.-Nam-June-Paik.-1995-C.E.-Mixed-media..jpg?resize=467%2C770&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="467" height="770" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Phiber-Optik.-Nam-June-Paik.-1995-C.E.-Mixed-media..jpg?w=273&amp;ssl=1 273w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Phiber-Optik.-Nam-June-Paik.-1995-C.E.-Mixed-media..jpg?resize=182%2C300&amp;ssl=1 182w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Phiber Optik. Nam June Paik. 1995 C.E. Mixed media.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Digital Spirituality</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Bill Viola</em></strong> manipulates video installation and water to explore themes such as birth, death, and spiritual experience through heightened sensory perception and awareness.</p>
<blockquote><p>His use of water can be traced back to a childhood incident where he nearly drowned in a lake, which he described as “the most beautiful world I’ve ever seen in my life… without fear and peaceful.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The Messenger</em></strong> is composed of a large video projection produced for the interior of Durham Cathedral in England, a setting that amplifies the implicit spirituality of the work. A nude male figure slowly emerges from the watery depths, breaks the water&#8217;s surface to draw a deep breath, and sinks back into the dark void. Each time he rises, his breath becomes a forceful primal sound of life that resonates in the space of the cathedral.</p>
<p>Viola’s use of nudity in his works symbolizes the pure state of the soul. Images of submersion and drowning, symbolic of baptism, draw on his own spiritual experience when nearly drowning. The piece is a slow and cyclical meditation on the elemental act of drawing breath, representing the cycle of life and death.</p>
<p>The emergence of the figure from the water resembles rituals of spiritual rebirth found in many religious traditions. While Nam June Paik’s work explores and celebrates the interconnectivity between man and machine, <strong>Viola’s installations use technology to draw the viewer into a rhythmic, trancelike state of transcendence.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>The Messenger</strong></em></p>
<p>Viola uses similar elemental symbolism in <strong><em>The Crossing</em></strong>, a double projection of two videos on opposite sides of a 16-foot screen. One side is a video loop of a man slowly emerging from the background as water starts to fall on him, until it washes him away. This water symbolizes spiritual experience and rebirth. The other side shows that same man appearing and being engulfed in flames. The flames symbolize hell and spiritual experience. Both are set to a soundtrack that challenges perceptions and vision’s impact on them.</p>
<p>While viewers think they hear contrasting sounds of fire and rain, the sound is actually one soundtrack that they perceive differently according to the image they are watching. This emphasizes the concept of perception versus reality, causing a sensory and meditative experience and emphasizing the fine line of redemption in world religions.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Appropriations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cindy Sherman</strong> explores gender, and <strong>the way Western art presents the female body through the “male gaze”.</strong></p>
<p>Her black-and-white photographs, called <strong><em>Untitled Film Stills</em></strong> examine the stereotypical ways women are depicted in film. Taking control of her own image and constructing her own identity, Sherman is the designer, actor, director, and photographer of the series.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Untitled Film Still #15</em></strong>, the subject is a sexy female lead in bobby socks and high heels. She looks wistfully out of the window. Sherman takes the concept of representing women in art and popular culture and interprets it through the film still to show how women adapt and are expected to assume many different roles depending on their circumstances.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2585" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Film-Still-15.-Cindy-Sherman.-1978-C.E.-Gelatin-silver-print..jpg?resize=624%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Film-Still-15.-Cindy-Sherman.-1978-C.E.-Gelatin-silver-print..jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Film-Still-15.-Cindy-Sherman.-1978-C.E.-Gelatin-silver-print..jpg?resize=234%2C300&amp;ssl=1 234w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Untitled Film Still #15</em>. </strong>Cindy Sherman. 1978 C.E. Gelatin silver print.</p>
<p>Sherman exemplifies both the relationship of male and female and that of contemporary and historical perspectives in her <strong><em>Untitled (#228)</em></strong>, from the History Portraits series, which can be viewed in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description. Here, Sherman portrays Judith from the Apocrypha, a portion of the Catholic Old Testament. Judith was an attractive Jewish widow who devised a strategy to save the city of Bethulia, her home, which was threatened by King Nebuchadnezzar’s Assyrian army under the command of Holofernes. Judith seduced Holofernes while he was drunk and then decapitated him. When the Assyrian soldiers came to storm Bethulia, they retreated when they saw Holofernes’s head.</p>
<p>Sherman worked from the representations in paintings done in the style of Italian, French, and Northern European painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. The story of Judith returning with Holofernes’s head has been represented in works by Sandro Botticellli and Cristofani Allori. Sherman’s Judith has rich tapestries hung behind her, symbolizing the domestic expectations of women. She is clothed in a red robe with a black sash, reminiscent of the clothing represented in Botticelli’s work.</p>
<p>In contrast to the traditional representations of Judith, the graphic nature of the beheading is represented in Sherman’s by the knife and the blood-stained left hand. The head of Holofernes is in her right, represented by a wrinkled, grey, balding mask.</p>
<p><strong>Sherman’s representation of Judith is significant</strong> as she is a historical figure who used her feminine nature and seduction to achieve a goal, exploiting herself. This is a departure from previous representations: The grotesque is representative of female interpretation of the subject as opposed to the male, sexualized version.</p>
<h5><strong>Off With Her Head</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yinka Shonibare</strong> is a British-Nigerian artist who considers himself biracial, being from both England and Nigeria. The artist expresses his frustration with the continual cultural push to classify a person as one race. His works, including <strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong>, exemplify this duality and comment on the superficiality of race. Influenced by <strong><em>The Swing</em></strong> by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Shonibare’s representation is a headless mannequin clothed in batik fabrics with African-inspired prints. This portrayal raises both political and cultural questions for the viewer.</p>

<p><strong>The Swing. Jean-Honoré Fragonard. 1767 C.E. Oil on canvas</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Why Headless?</strong></h5>
<p>The headless mannequin is a direct reference to the <strong>French Revolution and use of the guillotine</strong>. The extravagant lifestyle of the monarchy before the Revolution is reflected in Fragonard’s <strong><em>The Swing</em></strong>.  Shonibare is bringing to light the irony of the Rococo style, the extravagant and promiscuous lifestyles of the monarchy, and the consequences thereof.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Why African-inspired Prints?</strong></h5>
<p>The use of batik fabric in the European-inspired dress is symbolic of colonialism and the relationship between Europe and Africa. <strong>Batik fabrics</strong> have inspired international fashion and are associated with West African nations. Worn by millions of Africans today, the brightly colored and patterned fabrics <strong>originally came from Indonesia and were imported by Dutch colonists to Africa</strong>. They are now made by African women and are symbolic of their identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Dreamings in Action</strong></h5>
<p>Artists portray their cultural influence and tradition within their artworks. <strong>Indigenous Australian artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye </strong>was born around 1910 but did not start working artistically until 1977, when <strong>she started working with batik</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1988, she began painting in acrylics on canvas. Her painting <strong><em>Earth’s Creation</em></strong> portrays a traditional narrative of the creation myth and the time of the <strong>Dreamings,</strong> inspired by her cultural life as an Anmatyerre elder.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dreamings were spirit beings who created ceremonies and sacred objects</strong>, or Aboriginal Laws, so they would be remembered and are important in all portions of indigenous life. Native Australian art symbolically links Indigenous Australians with these ancestral spirits. Those who practice this traditional religion believe that they are descended from the spirit beings and associate themselves with specific places related to the ancestors&#8217; stories and transformations.</p>
<p>The elders were responsible for the hierarchal system of training and initiation in which the knowledge of the sacred Dreaming stories are presented to individuals in stages over a lifetime. Kngwarreye was a lifelong custodian of the women&#8217;s Dreaming sites in her clan Country, Alhalkere. Kngwarreye believed her Dreaming was the source of the creative power and her knowledge. The dynamic and contrasting qualities of her brushstrokes and colors exemplify the ancestral power of the Dreamings in nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kngwarreye&#8217;s response when asked the meaning of her works, “whole lot, that’s whole lot”, representing her impression of existence through her experience in the Dreamings.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Bark painting depicting three spirit figures, super-natural beings of the Dreamtime</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Chaos and Harmony</strong></h5>
<p>In contrast to the culture and tradition portrayed in Kngwarrey’s work, African artist <strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> is entirely removed from African stylistic influences and <strong>seeks to express the search for a new African identity </strong>and its movement, accommodation, and change and represent its convergence with other cultures on the canvas.</p>
<p>Mehretu was born in Ethiopia in 1970 but moved to the U.S. and traveled extensively. The themes of displacement and relocation recurs in much of Mehretu&#8217;s work and not only exemplify her experiences in change and identity, but those of others who were displaced by choice or by force.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1236" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/246-Stadia-II.jpg?resize=717%2C547&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="717" height="547" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/246-Stadia-II.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/246-Stadia-II.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Stadia II</em>. Julie Mehretu. 2004 C.E. Ink and acrylic on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>Many of Mehretu’s works represent places where people congregate and pass through during their lives, symbolizing community. <strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> is a portrayal of a round stadium with tall walls like the <strong>Colosseum</strong> and overlaid with international emblems, flags, and corporate logos. The drifting background implies a sense of fluctuation and dislocation found in the chaos of the composition. By evoking multiple layers of time, places, and space, Mehretu conveys a sports metaphor in one image that explores competition, advertising, power, war, fanaticism, and media.</p>
<p>By paralleling her image with the <strong>Colosseum</strong>, the place where Roman warriors fought to the death for the entertainment of the people, Mehretu causes the viewer to reflect on nationalism, commercialization, and politics while using duality to represent change and evolution. This solidifies her exemplification of the new African identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Mass-Production</strong></h5>
<p>Not only can art be influenced by tradition and culture, but it can reflect the absurdity of culture.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Koons</strong> was raised in York, Pennsylvania, and studied painting in both Chicago and Maryland. In his <strong><em>Banality</em></strong> series, which shows evidence of the influence of Duchamp and Warhol, <strong>Koons uses kitsch</strong> and elevates the anonymous, cheaply produced objects to a high-art level to combine high art, craftsmanship, and massive scale.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1772" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1772" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1772" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230-Pink-Panther.jpg?resize=459%2C599&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="459" height="599" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230-Pink-Panther.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230-Pink-Panther.jpg?resize=230%2C300&amp;ssl=1 230w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Pink Panther. Jeff Koons. 1988 C.E. Glazed porcelain.</strong></figcaption></figure>
<p>In <strong><em>Pink Panther</em></strong>, Koons portrays a popular cartoon character in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s in a sexualized position with Jayne Mansfield, an actress, performer, and centerfold model of the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>The sculpture is pastel colored and made of porcelain, giving it a glossy appearance. Koons’s sculpture functions as a commentary on middle-class values, exemplifying the commercialization that begins in childhood with cartoons and materialism of kitsch and continues with sex symbols in film and popular culture.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Koons, simply put, is Duchamp with lots of ostentatious trimmings. This is not a pretty sight. Duchamp’s ready-mades have an almost monastic austerity. Koons has bulked them up, transforming the ultimate insider’s art into the art that will not shut up. For Koons’s supporters, and they are legion, this is an anti-tradition that has become an honorable tradition, with all that implies about the risks and rewards of legitimacy. The art historians, with their addiction to neat chronologies, will tell you that Duchamp begat Rauschenberg and Johns, who begat Warhol, who begat Koons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jed Pearl (American art critic and author)</p></blockquote>
<p>While Koons’s work exemplifies the influence of pop culture, the manipulation of mass production within the artwork of Chinese artist <strong>Ai Weiwei</strong> exemplifies his political activism and philosophies.</p>
<p>Ai Wewei is an outspoken critic of the Communist Party. In January of 2011, the Chinese government razed his studio. His work represents contemporary Chinese engagement both with the art world at large and with the continuing issue of government censorship of the arts in China.</p>
<p><strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds)</em></strong> consists of millions of unique, hand-crafted, porcelain sunflower seeds. Each seed was individually sculpted and painted by specialists working in small-scale workshops in the city of Jingdezhen, China. This is significant as they were mass-produced but unique, which conflicts with the idea of mass production.</p>
<p>The seeds also carry personal associations for Weiwei—they were a common street snack shared by friends and related to Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. During this time, propaganda images depicted Chairman Mao as the sun and the mass of people as sunflowers turning toward him, and individuals were stripped of personal freedom. But for Weiwei, the sharing of sunflower seeds was a gesture of human compassion in a time of uncertainty, poverty, and repression.</p>

<p><strong>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds).</strong></p>
<p>In comparison to Koons’s use of porcelain as kitsch, Weiwei ‘s use of porcelain is significant as it is one of China’s prized exports. The seeds were displayed in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Museum from 2010 to 2011. Each separate seed challenges the readymade concept of the works of Duchamp, Warhol, and Koons and is a commentary on the human condition.</p>
<p>The individual seed is part of artwork and is an artwork to itself.</p>
<p>The works parallels human existence where each is an individual and important, each is also part of something bigger. This also exemplifies Weiwei’s political philosophies as an observation on the reduction of the individual in Communism.</p>
<h5><strong>Nature, Sexual Identity, and Spirituality</strong></h5>
<p>Some artists reflect the influence of culture and tradition, other represent relationships with nature, spiritual yearning, and sexual identity.</p>
<p><strong>Kiki Smith</strong> was trained as an emergency medical technician and draws on her EMT experiences to present the human body not as a poetic expression of the soul but as a fragmented container of organs, flesh, bone, and fluid.</p>
<p>Smith also explores the subjugation of the female body and its erotic interpretation by male artists by using the female’s inner biological systems to represent gender in her art. Her work breaks down the barrier of skin to expose these parts that are usually kept hidden from view and from our own recognition of our real nature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ribs </em></strong>is a rib cage constructed out of terracotta, a delicate material that reiterates the concept of fragility, evoking a shudder from the viewer because it deals so coldly with carnal realities.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Lying with the Wolf</em></strong>, Smith strays from her previous portrayals of the female body and depicts a female nude reclining beside a wolf. The work is one in a series that explores women’s relationships with animals using representations found in visual, literary, and oral histories. The woman is based on the fairy tale character Little Red Riding Hood and Saint Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris who was believed to have had a close relationship with animals and was able to domesticate wolves.</p>
<p>The woman and wolf are depicted as at peace rather than as predator and prey, in an almost sexualized pose. This reflects oneness and union with nature along with a yearning to connect the earthly with the spiritual and embodies the complex relationship of humans with animals.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Racial Divide</strong></h5>
<p>Artists intentionally explore the impact of European colonization and its influences. The art of <strong>Doris Salcedo</strong>, a Columbian-born sculptor, is influenced by her life in Columbia and the impact of European cultures there. <strong><em>Shibboleth</em></strong> is Salcedo’s statement about racism and represents the gap between white Europeans and everyone else.</p>
<p>The word shibboleth is Hebrew in origin and is derived from a story in Judges 12:6 of the Old Testament and Torah. The Gileadites used the pronunciation of the word as a test to identify members of the tribe of Ephraim who were trying to secretly return to their home territory. If they couldn’t say it correctly, they were revealed as Ephraimites and killed. It is now used to mean a custom, principle, or belief that distinguishes a group of people. It is used as a division, a way to exclude those deemed unsuitable.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shibboleth </em></strong>was installed in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Museum. It is a wound-like crack in the floor that extends through the building, starting as a thin line and expanding to almost a foot wide at its widest point. The work is as much about the crack as it is its emphasis on the negative space, the area around the crack. The crack is filled with a steel mesh fence that is symbolic of the barriers used to define boundaries and divisions.</p>
<p>Salcedo said that “it represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. The space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.”</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><em>Shibboleth</em></strong></p>
<h5>What Happens After Postmodern Architecture?</h5>
<p>The fluctuation in architectural styles in modern art is exemplified in the International Style of Villa Savoye, the connection and unity with nature in Fallingwater, the Postmodern complexity of the House in New Castle County, and the innovation of modern skyscrapers like the Seagram Building. Architecture in the 20th century provided interpenetration of the interior and exterior spaces and incorporated new materials and technologies.</p>
<h5><strong>Guggenheim Bilbao Museo</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Guggenheim Bilbao Museo</strong> is notable for its innovative postmodern architectural design<strong>. Frank Gehry, the architect</strong>, designed the Guggenheim to be a collapsing collection of units that is harmonious with the landscape. A combination of irregular asymmetrical and imbalanced forms covered in limestone and titanium gives the building a Space Age character.</p>
<p>At the top is a flower-shaped projection, and a glass-walled atrium in the center allows the infusion of natural light and open views of the landscape. The Guggenheim is an <strong>example of Deconstructivism</strong> in its imbalance, asymmetry, and irregularity, which is reflected in both the exterior and the interior. The organic, sculptural structure also demonstrates the abilities of computer-assisted design with interconnecting, flowing spaces and dynamic curves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1755" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?resize=767%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="767" height="576" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts</strong> was also a result of computer-assisted design. The architect, <strong>Zaha Hadid</strong>, champions the use of pure colors and abstract geometric shapes to express feeling in creative art and harmony with the environment. Her goal is to evince an emotional effect from the viewer through unadorned planes in dynamic arrangements.</p>
<p>The MAXXI is a composition of bending oblong tubes that overlap and intersect, and Hadid paid specific attention to the natural lighting by using thin concrete beams on the ceiling together with glass covering. Many facets of the exterior are reflective due to the glass covering used. Another example of <strong>Deconstructivism</strong>, the building was designed to provide a fluid interior without redundant wall divisions or interruptions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1760" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?resize=831%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="831" height="329" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?w=422&amp;ssl=1 422w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?resize=300%2C119&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Artists like Nam June Paik and Bill Viola manipulated technology, like television and video, to create artworks that exemplify cultural and spiritual connections. Other artists appropriate and re-appropriate artworks to explore and reflect cultural, historical, and gender relationships or as a reaction to cultural influence. Architecture in the 20th century provided interpenetration of the interior and exterior spaces and incorporated new materials and technologies.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1753" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/234-Earths-Creation.jpg?resize=990%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="429" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/234-Earths-Creation.jpg?w=321&amp;ssl=1 321w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/234-Earths-Creation.jpg?resize=300%2C130&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>Theme: Rejection of Mainstream</strong></h4>
<p>In <strong>Post-Modernism</strong>, multiple styles existed at once, many artists defy categorization, and many artists are not white or male.  Traditional modes of representation are rejected in favor of (re)discovering and critiquing previous cultural practices. In essence, Post-Modernism is an expansion of the art world, of what it means to be an artist, and of what the definition of art is.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1980-present)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>TV, computer, digital media and the internet changed people’s social interactions, and information about the world around them.</li>
<li>Globalization has threatened non-Western narratives and practices.</li>

Revival of tradition</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> British Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Summer Trees</em></strong> by <strong>Song Su-nam</strong> is an <strong>ink on paper</strong> artwork that measures <strong>2 feet tall</strong>. It uses broad, vertical, and elongated parallel brush strokes of ink. The strokes blend, overlapping and bleeding with one another using a monochromatic palette of velvety blacks and grays.</p>
<p>Blurry, feathery edges reveal pale washes applied to wet paper. The crisper lines are ones that were applied to dry paper. Formal simplicity and abstraction of <strong>Abstract Expressionists</strong> combined with <strong>subtle tonal variation of Asian ink paintings</strong> are combined in this work.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Song felt that materials and styles of the West, though popular in Korea, did not express his identity.</p>
<p>So, he blended the two together.</p>
<p><strong>Korean</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>medium of ink</li>
<li>paper</li>
<li>subject</li>
<li>symbolism</li>
<li>blacks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>West</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>style</li>
<li>abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>This was part of a movement called <strong>Sumukwha</strong> to recover a national identity through art. This work has allusions to scholars and friendship. It could be Song’s statement of optimism in the rediscovery of traditional values through this group.</p>
<p>It references the tradition of <strong>literati (scholar-artist)</strong>. Song was considered a <strong>modern literati</strong>. Even though we spoke of literati with <em>Travels Among Mountains and Streams</em>, remember <strong>sinification</strong> brought Chinese culture to Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The title <strong><em>Summer Trees</em></strong> refers to the natural world and the highly stylized trees with thick foliage and trunks. In Korean and Chinese tradition, <strong>a group of pine trees</strong> can symbolize a gathering of honorable friends, or friends who are wise and intellectual.</p>
<p>Mountainous landscapes and plants serve as metaphors for the ideal qualities of literati:</p>
<ul>
<li>loyalty</li>
<li>intelligence</li>
<li>strength</li>
<li>honor</li>
</ul>
<p>Literati lived lives connected to nature and away from the chaos of urban life.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Song Su-nam</strong> was a leader of the <strong>Sumukhwa movement</strong> of the 1980s. Sumukhwa was a movement to recover national identity through reviving traditional Korean art as Western modernism/abstraction was becoming increasingly popular across Korea. It is a Korean term for ink wash painting aka literati painting.</p>
<p><strong>Why was Westernization growing? </strong>After the Korean War, a growing American presence in South Korea brought with it an increase of Westernization. Many were concerned that traditional Korean culture was disappearing.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong>  This is art in a global context, and an expansion of art object/artist. It is a social critique.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>audience is united</strong> by their illiteracy. We end up searching for what does not exist – an understanding of this text and history.</p>
<p>The work <strong>upholds the ancient Daoist belief</strong> that the deepest truths can never be captured by words alone. <strong>This is a critique</strong> of the meaninglessness of contemporary political language and as a commentary on the illegibility of the past.</p>
<p><strong>It draws attention</strong> to the erasing of history under Mao’s Communist regime. In this way, people cannot learn about the history of China, as we cannot read these texts. It represents a loss of meaning and culture.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>In ancient Chinese art, <strong>squares symbolized earth</strong>. Look at how the books are arranged on the ground, and long swoops and curves indicate Heaven. Look how the scrolls are arranged overhead.</p>
<p><strong>“Sky book”</strong> in Chinese means something that is incomprehensible. It’s an inspiration from the title.</p>
<p>Also, it is an allusion to the texts suspended overhead.</p>
<p>There are 4,000 characters created to appear to be real but are unreadable and meaningless. They are meant to mimic traditional Chinese fonts and lettering. Even the way he arranged the texts looks like they are real. Volume 2 is organized like Chinese medical texts, while Volume 3 is like literary texts.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Xu Bing </strong>Grew up surrounded by books in Beijing. His father was a historian, and his mother was a librarian.</p>
<p>During <strong>Mao’s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)</strong>, millions of students/professors were sent to rural villages and work camps. Mao also destroyed Chinese text, art, and histories through the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>In 1975, Xu Bing is separated from his family and forced into agricultural labor at a commune. In 1977, he was able to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing for his bachelors in Printmaking. He trained in social realism and propaganda art. He made his name as a “radical” and “avant-garde” artist.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pink Panther</em> </strong>by American artist<strong> Jeff Koons </strong>is a work using<strong> glazed porcelain </strong>that stands<strong> 3 feet by 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>The work was made in triplicate commercial production. It is highly polished and gleaming. The glossy texture makes it look factory-made, associated with cheap figurines. <strong>Kitsch,</strong> a word of German origin, refers to mass-produced imagery designed to please everyone.</p>
<p>The colors are garish and bright. Think toothpaste minty colors with yellow hair and bubblegum pink. Deliberately gaudy colors were common in kitsch/knickknacks/souvenirs. These were Inspired by German figurines.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pink Panther</em> </strong>From a series called “<strong>Banality”</strong> created with the condition of being unoriginal, dull, stale, boring. The series consisted of 20 sculptures in porcelain and polychromed wood. There appeared to be nothing serious about any of them.</p>

<p>Koons was doing what Duchamp did. How far could he take the definition of art?</p>
<p>This gave viewers several challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenged taste (high class/fine art) (tacky vs. classy).</li>
<li>Challenged originality (stole another’s image).</li>
<li>Challenged uniqueness of the individual art object (made 3 of them).</li>
<li>Challenged construction (didn’t make it himself).</li>
<li>Drew from pop culture to create a sculpture that comments on art and beauty as commodities.</li>
<li>Is a simple (or even tacky) appropriation of other people’s images made by other people art?
<ul>
<li>He is a critic of mass culture, and he reveals this by utilizing mass culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Capitalize on the recognizable to sell art.</li>
<li>“Marriage of pop culture and art-world elitism”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pink Panther</strong> is a cartoon character from film/TV series in the 1960s/70s. The woman in the sculpture is</p>
<p><strong>Jayne Mansfield</strong> a 1960s B-list Hollywood star (and real-life mother of actress Mariska Hargitay who plays Olivia on Law &amp; Order: SVU!) Mansfield was a buxom platinum blond, known for wardrobe malfunctions.</p>
<p>Pink Panther is in an erotic pose with Mansfield, who is smiling, bare-breasted, and tilting her head back as if to smile at a crowd of onlookers. Her right hand covers her exposed breast. Pink Panther’s tail is tucking into the back of her dress.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This work was sold in 2014 to MOMA for $16,800,000. Koons was Gauguin-like in his intentional self-promotion. He took out ads in major art magazines and employed a PR/image consultant.</p>
<p>Accused of breaking copyright laws, Koons claimed fair use by parody. He was sued for copyright infringement and settled out of court.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong>  The expansion of art object/artist that challenges tradition. Appropriation is key.</p>

<p><strong><em>Untitled (#228)</em></strong> from the History Portraits series by American artist <strong>Cindy Sherman</strong> is a work of <strong>photography </strong>that measures <strong>6 feet eight inches by 4 feet.</strong></p>
<p>The artwork is <strong>based on a Botticelli painting. </strong>The figure is pushed forward on the picture plane, and it is well-lit. The colors of <strong>red, blue, yellowish gold are prominent</strong>. The upper body is in a triangular composition. The size, lighting, color, and composition are all supposed to be similar to Old Master paintings. The size is equal to a Grand Manner/history painting.</p>

<p>Sandro Botticelli. <i>Judith Holding the Head of Holofernes.</i></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>From the <strong>“History Portraits”</strong> series – the artist draws inspiration from the history of art. Each work is <strong>based on an Old Master</strong> masterpiece showing her in it. She portrays a feminist hero. Many of her photographs show stereotypes of women or traditionally strong women.</p>
<p>Judith has traditionally been viewed as strong, but alternatively dangerous and sexual.</p>
<p>She <strong>blends aspects of painting with photography</strong>. By creating a photograph modeled after a painting, she becomes a prop even though we assume photography is truthful. We are supposed to realize photography is as much a construct as painting was.</p>
<p>When critiquing the photography, we cannot avoid the fact it can be heavily manipulated. But it also argues for the legitimacy of photography as artistic. If photography can replicate a painting, then photography must have some merits and must be like painting.</p>
<p>This work depicts as reality something that was originally a painting. It presents painting via photography.  Photography cannot be inherently trusted even though this is generally our attitude. (Think magazines and social media).</p>
<p>What Cindy Sherman is really doing is what Daguerre tried to do. That is to illustrate that photography can replicate painting.</p>
<h5><strong>What We See</strong></h5>
<p>This replicates <strong>the story of Judith and Holofernes</strong>. Judith was a heroine in the bible who slayed the Assyrian general, Holofernes. She got him drunk, seduced him, and then beheaded him.</p>

<p>The artist depicts herself in costume, standing in front of textiles in the background This was typical of Baroque art. <strong>Sherman</strong> wears Renaissance-era fashion, consisting of a red-satin dress, with an empire waistline, cinched by a dark blue sash. In her hand is the head (mask) of Holofernes, who is old and wrinkled. In the other hand, she holds a bloody knife.</p>
<p>She stares forward with a blank expression, with a heavily made-up face. Her eyebrows are thin, and her lips are painted red.</p>
<p>Her bare feet point outward and are out of proportion. This might be a reference to early Renaissance difficulties with foreshortening.</p>
<h5><strong>Feminist Art</strong></h5>
<p>Feminist art aims to look back through the canon of art history and draws attention to women through women’s stories, female subjects, and female artists. Popular subjects are the same as during the Renaissance and Baroque period, which were popular stories of strong Biblical women.</p>
<h5><strong>The Book of Judith</strong></h5>
<p>The book of Judith from the Old Testament recounts the story of Judith. To save her people from the Assyrian king, she seduced her way into the tent of the general Holofernes. She then got him drunk and beheaded him. She triumphantly returned with the head to show her people.</p>
<p>The story symbolized triumph over tyranny (much like David and Goliath), and the dangers of femininity.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> private collection</p>
<p><strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre, </em>from the series <em>The French Collection, Part I; #1</em>.,</strong> is a work by artist <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> that uses <strong>acrylic on canvas, with a tie-dyed, pieced fabric border</strong>. The artwork measures 6 feet 3 inches by 6 feet and 9 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> calls this work a <strong>story-quilt</strong>. She creates <strong>a central image using acrylic paint on canvas</strong>, then surrounds it with a patchwork cloth border that includes her <strong>handwritten text</strong>. In this way, she <strong>utilizes text and image together</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, she sandwiches a layer of batting underneath the canvas and on top of another piece of cloth. The figures are simple, flat, and stiff with a space that is shallow.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Through her art, she can rewrite the past through weaving together the history of African Americans and women. This is an alternative to the white masculine narratives that are prevalent in art history. This highlights the ways in which African-Americans and their experiences have been left out. Through most of history they have not been the subjects or the intended audiences of Western painting.</p>
<p><strong>Ringgold’s</strong> technique challenges the definition of painting and <strong>fine art</strong>. She HAS used acrylic on canvas but has mixed in the prominent <strong>folk art</strong>/craft tradition of quilting. Folk art is often defined in part by being produced by untrained artists.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is the first in Ringgold’s series of twelve “story quilts” called <strong><em>The French Collection. </em></strong>The story tells the fictional narrative of Willa Marie Simone, a young black woman who moves to Paris in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Willa Marie’s adventures in Paris in the 1920s lead her to meet celebrities: Picasso, Matisse, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Josephine Baker.</p>
<p>The <strong>three paintings</strong> that the work shows as a backdrop at the Louvre are <strong>all by DaVinci</strong>: <em>Madonna and Child and St. Anne; Mona Lisa; Virgin of the Rocks</em>. Note all the paintings are of woman and girls.</p>
<p>The girls dancing in front of the art become the show – instead of the historical white version on the walls!</p>
<h5><strong>Text</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p><strong>Text on this image</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Marcia and her three little girls took me dancing at the Louvre. I thought I was taking them to see the Mona Lisa, but you’ve never seen anything like this. Well, the French hadn’t either. Nevermind Leonardo da Vinci and Mona Lisa, Marcia and her three girls were the show</em>.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Art Expansion</strong></h5>
<p>This work is an expansion of the art world and the art object. <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> is an African American woman, and the Art object is now a folk art/fine art hybrid. This reflects shifts into post-Modernism.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism</strong> rejects Modernism’s emphasis on universal meaning and abstraction.</p>
<h5><strong>Why the Story Quilts were Made</strong></h5>
<p>Ringgold’s story-quilting technique is important. <strong>Her mother was a fashion designer and seamstress</strong>. When her mother died in 1981, Ringgold started making these quilts.</p>
<p>Quilts have been associated with <strong>women’s domestic work</strong> and <strong>women’s connections with one another. </strong></p>
<p>Quilting is often done collectively. Young girls watch and participate to learn family stories, cultural backgrounds, and technical skills.</p>
<p>Quilts were of particular importance to the history of African Americans. On the Underground Railroad, codes and hidden messages were sewn onto quilts in safe houses that could help slaves find more secret routes and safe houses to the North.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trade (Gifts for Trading Land with White People) </em></strong>by artist<strong> Jaune Quick-to-See Smith </strong>is an artwork of<strong> oil and mixed media on canvas </strong>that measures<strong> 5 by 14 feet.   It is </strong>divided into three panels or a <strong>triptych</strong>.</p>
<p>Is this a painting? A collage? An installation? Is it all three?</p>
<p>This is what is known as an <strong>assemblage</strong>. This means bringing together a variety of media to make something 3D. It was inspired by AbEx painters with their energetic application of abstract brushstrokes.</p>
<p>This work uses white, yellow, green, and red paint.</p>

<li>Her middle name <strong>Quick-to-see</strong> was given by her grandmother, who commented on her perception.</li>
<li>Received a BA in art education instead of studio because her instructors told her no woman could have a career as an artist, even though they acknowledged she had been better than all the men in the classes.</li>

<li>References the role of trade goods in stories like the acquisition of Manhattan by Dutch colonists in 1626 for $24. Although the story is probably not true, it speaks to the idea that Native Americans were commonly lured off their land by what were in fact inexpensive trade goods.  They did not have the same understanding of private property as Europeans did.

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> National Museum of Australia</p>
<p><strong><em>Earth’s Creation</em></strong> by Australian Aboriginal artist<strong> Emily Kame Kngwarreye </strong>is a work of<strong> synthetic polymer paint on canvas </strong>that measures<strong> 20 by 9 feet. </strong></p>
<p>What makes this postmodern?  This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object/artist.</p>
<p>The work is purely abstract and nonrepresentational. There are gestural marks, and each swatch traces the movement of her own hands or brush. She laid the canvas on the ground and sat on it or beside it while she painted.</p>
<p>The work has often been compared to AbEx though she knew nothing about it. It is similar in canvas size, gestural strokes and is an action painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the study of the landscape with the inspiration of colors, seasons, and sensations. The work depicts stories and elements of her cultural heritage. It captures the ways she was influenced by the environment.</p>
<p>The work promotes <strong>sand-painting or dot-painting</strong>, which is an indigenous technique.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Uses the traditional dot-work pattern typical in traditional Aboriginal Australian artwork</li>
<li>All works are influenced by landscapes</li>
<li>This one represents the lushness of “green time” after periods of heavy rain by using tropical blues, yellows, greens, vibrant reds.</li>

<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Kngwarreye (Ung-WAAR-ay) was an aboriginal artist completely untrained who did not paint until she was 80 years old. It is estimated that she produced over 3,000 paintings during her short eight-year painting career.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1994" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/234-Artists.jpg?resize=475%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="475" height="663" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/234-Artists.jpg?resize=215%2C300&amp;ssl=1 215w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/234-Artists.jpg?w=284&amp;ssl=1 284w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>She was the first Aboriginal artist whose work broke the million-dollar mark at auction when this was sold in 2007.</p>
<p>Born in 1910, she spent 66 years as a forced laborer on European pastoral estates. When she was “freed,” she began to learn about ceremonial paintings and began working in batiks (dyed cloths) first, as well as ceremonial sand paintings.</p>
<p>One of her works was selected for the cover of an exhibition catalog. Critics lauded the piece and virtually overnight, she achieved acclaim.</p>
<h5><strong>The Culture</strong></h5>
<p>Aboriginal culture is intimately connected to the landscape of Australia such as deserts and grasslands. Landscape is a common subject in Aboriginal art.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rebellious Silence</em></strong><strong>, from the Women of Allah series </strong>by<strong> Shirin Neshat (artist) </strong>and<strong> photo by Cynthia Preston </strong>is a work of<strong> ink on paper. </strong>The work is formally striking with hard edges of black color against a bright white background.</p>
<p>The portrait is bisected along a vertical seam created by the barrel of the rifle. The woman’s eyes stare at us from both sides of the divide.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>honors female revolutionaries</strong> on both sides in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It examines the complexities of <strong>women’s identities</strong> in the Middle East. <strong><em>Women of Allah series</em></strong> has allowed for a more complicated image of Middle Eastern women and challenges the simplistic and stereotypical Islamic woman that the media has shown us.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The artwork portrays female warriors of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in series called “Women of Allah”. It addresses <strong>four symbols that Westerners associate with the Muslim world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text </strong>covers part of her face that is usually covered by a niqab (traditional Muslim face scarf). The poetry is written by Iranian women about the revolution (Tahereh Saffarzadeh’s poem called <em>Allegiance with Wakefulness</em>).</p>
<p>Persian poetry is a rich tradition in Islam – Westerners do not know this history. Western viewers who do not read it will still understand the importance of Islamic script.</p>
<p>Post-1979 Iranian Revolution, all Muslim women were required to wear a <strong>veil</strong> in public.  Many Muslims found the practice empowering and affirmative of their religious identities, even though in the West we interpret this as oppressive.</p>
<p>The <strong>gun</strong> represents control and violence, but also religious martyrdom. We assume gun must mean violence right away. Westerners associate violence with jihad, although this is not the case. The rifle references the deliberate arming of Muslim women during the revolution.</p>
<p>Look at the <strong>woman’s gaze</strong>. Notice that in this image she STARES BACK.  Westerners assume she would/should be modest  and that she has been conditioned to be this way. Here she is retaking her body and freeing it from objectification</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Iran in Context</strong></h5>
<p>Iran had been ruled by Shah (king) Pahlavi from 1941 – 1979. He was known for violent repression of Islamic religious freedom. Yet he FAVORED westernization. Iran was ally of both Britain and the US.  Women’s rights were promoted.</p>
<p>The 1979 Iranian Revolution was led by Ayatollah Khomeini. A very strict and conservative religious government dismantled Westernization.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Shirin Neshat </strong>was born in Iran in 1957 and raised in Westernization. She attended Catholic school to learn Western and Islamic history. Later, in the mid-1970s, she left Iran, moving to California, as attitudes towards the West grew increasingly hostile. She could not show her work in modern Iran as it was too dangerous.</p>

<p><strong><em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop)</em></strong> by artist<strong> Pepon Osorio</strong> is a mixed-media installation. This large-scale work is immersive and visually opulent. It has been dubbed Nuyorican Baroque in reference to the opulence of New Spanish Baroque. It is meant to be entered and experienced by the viewer.</p>
<p>This work re-creates the artist’s memory of his first haircut at age 5, where he was told not to cry like a girl. He wanted to capture the limiting gender expectations of being male. There were only two options&#8211;being macho or being gay. The work challenge to the strong sense of machismo and homophobia in Latino communities. This is also a celebration of Nuyorican culture while at the same time offering a critique of it.</p>

<p>“Shop” <strong>contains images of Latino men</strong>, some crying and being bullied, and some men acting strong. There are powders that enhance male sexual performance and products for penile enhancement.</p>
<p>It is packed with <strong>masculine symbols</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>barber chairs</li>
<li>sports paraphernalia</li>
<li>depictions of sperm and circumcision</li>
<li>phallic symbols</li>

<li>male action heroes</li>
<li>Puerto Rican flags</li>
<li>Baseballs</li>
<li>Framed portraits of famous Latino men.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also included videos playing interviews of Latino elder men from a retirement home nearby being asked about the idea of machismo and pro-traditionally defined masculinity.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pepon Osorio</strong> is a Puerto Rican born artist who was a social worker in the Bronx. He was not trained as an artist. He had a first-hand view of youth culture and the social expectations of his community. He lived in the Nuyorican Community (Puerto Ricans living in New York City) who have a distinct sense of cultural pride. Machoism is a central tenet of gender identity in this community.</p>

<p>The work was created in collaboration with local residents. They even <strong>offered haircuts to viewers in the opening art show.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000)</em></strong> by Samoan artist<strong> Michel Tuffery, </strong>from New Zealand<strong>. </strong>It is a<strong> mixed media work </strong>made with<strong> found objects</strong> assembled and <strong>appropriated</strong> into <strong>sculpture in the round. </strong>It is made from flattened corned-beef tins joined by rivets. Notice how the coloration of the tins affects where it is placed, such as hooves, bodies or faces to provide contrast.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The work argues that foreign intervention and imperialism creates dependency. It teaches us about the impact of colonial economies in Pacific Island culture.</p>
<p>Imported commodities became integral parts of Polynesian customs of feasting and gift-giving. This replaced the tradition of tapa cloth. Due to the presence of Europeans harvesting and slaughtering techniques, also changed.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000)</em></strong> was named for the local Samoan term for canned goods. The term is derived from the Samoan version of “pea soup” which is <strong>pisupo. </strong>Pea soup was one of the first canned foods to be introduced by Europeans. Pisupo later meant “canned food” as a broad term.</p>
<p>A life-size bull is made from flattened cans of corned beef <strong>symbolizing that animals are just products to be sold</strong>. Using the title with 2000 in it makes us think about a modern, mass-produced commodity like a vacuum.</p>

<h5><strong>Changes Through Western Influence</strong></h5>
<p>The presence of Europeans/Westerners changed two things:</p>
<p><strong>Gift -giving</strong> typically included tapa cloth and Fijian mats, like in the Processional for Queen Elizabeth II.  Later Canned foods quickly became prestigious items used as ceremonial gifts in Samoa. Pisupo (canned foods) quickly replaced traditional indigenous foods and caused native practices to die out.</p>
<p><strong>Farming</strong> (harvesting/slaughtering) practices changed completely to be replaced by imported canned food.</p>
<h5><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>This is art in a global context with  and expansion of art object/artist, along with a social critique.</p>

Revival of tradition</p>
<p><strong><em>Pure Land</em></strong> by artist <strong>Mariko Mori</strong> is a <strong>color photograph on glass</strong> measuring <strong>10 by 20 feet.</strong></p>
<p>Because it is printed on glass, the work has a shiny, reflective quality. The image was created using digital imagery and computer graphics. The huge scale uses the old art historical mentality that the size of the work indicates grandness, and significance.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This piece merges consumerism, entertainment, and traditional Japanese imagery together. It creates a modern space for and approach to Enlightenment. It shows we too can achieve Enlightenment in the modern age. This is a fusion of Japanese pop culture and traditional Japanese Buddhism.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>A female figure floats above a golden landscape above a lotus blossom. Six aliens play instruments and whirl. The artist depicted herself as <strong>Kichijoten, </strong>the <strong>Japanese goddess</strong> of happiness, fertility, beauty. Originally this was an Indian goddess incorporated into Buddhism. The pink and peach clothing mirrors the orange, yellow, and rose gold of the landscape.</p>
<p>The Dead Sea landscape, in which the image is set, is the lowest point on earth. Its high salinity does not support fish or plant life. In Shinto tradition, salt is used as purification in ceremonies.</p>
<p>The <strong>empty landscape</strong> is a reference to the Buddhist idea of emptiness that creates a calm state. <strong>Lotus blossom</strong> is a symbol of purity and rebirth. It is also a reference to Buddhism. <strong>Futuristic spacecraft</strong> may be a variation on a stupa the sacred Buddhist monument originally used as a reliquary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pure Land</em></strong> is the title, as well as the place where Buddhist devotees go after death. This is a common artistic subject in Japan. In these images, Buddha rested on a lotus blossom, surrounded by Bodhisattvas, the enlightened beings who do not pass on to nirvana. Pastel-colored aliens act as the Bodhisattva while Mori acts as Buddha. The figures are a reference to Japanese manga (graphic novels) and anime (films and TV).</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mariko Mori</strong> was born in Tokyo in 1967. She studied fashion and design and worked as a fashion model. Mori began to stage elaborate photo shoots, where she acted as director, producer, set designer, costume designer, and model.</p>
<p>The major question in post-WWII Japan is&#8211; how do we retain tradition and legacy, but modernize?</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object and artists.  Appropriation is key. There is a social critique as well as a revival of tradition.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Centre Pompidou</p>
<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf</em></strong> by <strong>Kiki Smith </strong>is a work of<strong> ink and pencil on paper. The paper on this large-scale work </strong>does not have a nice finish and is left wrinkled. This is really just a sketch!</p>
<p>The negative space is great and undefined. There is no horizon line. The reclining nude contains little to no modelling.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work is <strong>a feminist approach and retelling of popular folktales</strong>. The associations with Woman and Nature mean that the woman is not the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Why are women in fairy tales always in danger or near death?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Snow White</li>
<li>Sleeping Beauty</li>
<li>Ariel</li>
<li>Cinderella</li>
<li>Little Red Riding Hood</li>
<li>Belle</li>
</ul>
<p>Women have been associated with nature. Why does this imply women wouldn’t understand it? A deeper connection?</p>
<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf </em></strong> references the tradition of the reclining female nude but transforms it. The work is  not sexualized. She doesn’t stare out but reclines with animal. The audience doesn’t matter, she pays them no mind.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>A reclining female nude lays intimately with a wolf. This is not about bestiality, however, but it is an act of bonding between humans (especially women) and nature. The wolf nuzzles her affectionately, much like she cuddles with a dog. She strokes his fur.</p>
<p>The woman has tamed the wolf’s wildness. Neither is a victim any longer. This is symbiotic.</p>
<p>Both figures seem to nurture one another. They are not stereotypically predator and prey. It’s hard to pick who would have been the prey anyway. Is it the woman because she is vulnerable? Is it the animal to show man’s power over nature?</p>

<p><strong><em>Darkytown Rebellion</em></strong> by artist <strong>Kara Walker</strong> is a <strong>cut paper and projection on wall</strong> measuring <strong>37 feet wide</strong>. It occupies a 37-foot-wide corner of a gallery. Colors are projected on a wall full of black silhouettes made of paper. These were deliberately made to be reminiscent of the Victorian era, which was the era of slavery.</p>
<p>Silhouettes were an inexpensive alternative to painted photographic portraits. Traditionally, they were a bust profile, cut out, affixed to a non-black background, and framed.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The viewer is forced to become a part of the scene. As we walk in front of it, we cast our own shadows.</p>
<p>It is impossible for us to ignore the history of slavery and we must choose what kind of player we will be</p>
<p>The use of black paper is not just a reference to old Victorian silhouettes. These stories of slaves have been forgotten with no identifying information. The figures have become types. We will never know all of their stories.</p>
<p>Notice how quickly we recognize our stereotypes. We cannot see what race these figures actually are, and yet based upon their stereotypical features, we project information upon them. This work uses stereotypes to challenge how comfortable and recognizable they are.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This work depicts a scene from the pre-Civil War South. It shows slaves engaged in various acts of rebellion. At first glance, the colors and active figures make us think it is a parade or circus. Upon closer inspection, we realize this is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>There are 13 characters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flag bearers</li>
<li>Master taunting starving slave children</li>
<li>Nursing mother</li>
<li>Woman in hoop skirt attacking smaller slave</li>
<li>Various mutilated body parts</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject is a mix of fact and fantasy meant to evoke an emotional response. This is based on historical accounts of slave rebellions. Except for the outline of the bodies, all the subjects’ facial details are lost. The sitters are reduced to a few characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Kara Walker</strong> is a famous multi-media artist who works with paper and black stereotypes. She is highly controversial for her role in drawing attention and perpetuating stereotypes. She argues that</p>
<p>we are so familiar with African American stereotypes such as Uncle Tom, Mammie, and Aunt Jemima.</p>
<p>Inspired by an anonymous 19<sup>th</sup> century landscape painting with African American caricatures painted into it entitled <strong><em>Darkytown</em></strong>, she began to read about slave rebellions and accounts. Responding to continued contemporary racial violence in the US, our role in racism is important and still relevant.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong> is a<strong> mixed-media installation </strong>work by artist<strong> Yinka Shonibare </strong>measuring<strong> 10 feet tall. </strong>This is a 3D sculpture/ installation of a life-size headless female mannequin, installed in a corner of the gallery with foliage.  It is based on the iconic Rococo 1767 painting by Fragonard, <strong><em>The Swing. </em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a sculpture that is both familiar and strange to us. It <strong>draws our attention</strong> to the prominence of <strong>racism.</strong></p>
<p>It is jarring at first to see a black woman replace one of the most coquettish, erotic, and delicate women in the history of art. Why? We are not used to seeing black women in art as the main subject and especially in a glamorized and eroticized way.</p>
<p>As we participate in the voyeurism, we become like the man in the bush in <strong><em>The Swing.</em> </strong></p>
<p>This <strong>shows the multi-cultural, multi-racial world that we live in</strong>. The Identity is not singular, rather it is cross-cultural or multi-cultural. In this work we have a European painting and a black woman wearing Dutch wax (African fabric).</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2010" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/244-Close-UP.jpg?resize=821%2C583&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="821" height="583" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/244-Close-UP.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/244-Close-UP.jpg?resize=768%2C545&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/244-Close-UP.jpg?w=1014&amp;ssl=1 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Like Fragonard’s, <em>The Swing</em>, <strong>this work </strong><strong>retains a woman on swing, a shoe mid-flight, and the foliage. </strong>What has been <strong>excluded are the men, much of the garden, the race of woman, the head and identical clothing.</strong></p>
<p>The woman is <strong>dressed in a traditional French Rococo style, but it is made with African fabric (called Dutch wax)</strong>. This is different from the decorative and frilly opulence in the original.</p>
<p><strong>The woman has no head</strong>. This may refer to the fate that awaited many Rococo aristocrats in the French Revolution&#8212; the guillotine!  <em>The Swing</em> was seen as the epitome of excess and extravagance in the Rococo.</p>
<p>The woman is black rather than white. There is a <strong>juxtaposition</strong> of something that is European with what is African.</p>
<h5><strong>What Makes this Postmodern? </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong> allows us to understand art in a global context. It has an expansion of art object/artist, as well as a social critique. Appropriations are common to show challenges to tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Not Originally African</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dutch Wax</strong> fabrics were made in the Southeast Asian Dutch/English colonies. These quickly became even cheaper to produce in African colonies. Production was moved there. Eventually, the bright patterning became distinctive and integrated into African clothing and used in African nationalist movements.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2011" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/244-Artist.jpg?resize=440%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="440" height="720" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Yinka Shonibare </strong>is a British-born Nigerian who is sensitive to nationalism, identity, and race. Paralyzed on half of his body, he directs his artwork production to his studio.</p>
<p>The artist referred to himself as a hybrid. As an art student in London, his teacher told him to make work that expressed his African identity. This prompted him to think about stereotypes and the difficulties that exist for those who are multiracial.</p>

<p><strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> by artist<strong> El Anatsui </strong>is an art object made with<strong> aluminum and copper wire </strong>standing<strong> 16 feet tall. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it? </strong></p>
<p>A sculpture in 3D?  A painting to hang on the wall?  An installation?  Is it fine art or craft? Fabric? Post-Modernism purposefully disregards the limited categories imposed by Western art history.</p>
<p>This work is <strong>made from old liquor metal bottle caps</strong> and labels (<strong>modular)</strong>. ALL were found in  the Ghana bush (<strong>found object</strong>). The artist was careful to create <strong>bands of black, silver, gold, and red</strong>. These were fastened together with <strong>copper wire.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Construction</strong></h5>
<p>El Anatsui works in a warehouse. His assistants piece it together under his direction.</p>
<p>The artist <strong>never gives museums any hanging instructions</strong>.  The piece is always different when it is hung. <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> catches the light from every angle and creates a reflective surface.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bottle caps</strong> signify a fraught <strong>history of trade between Europe and Africa. </strong>European liquor was a major element of the transatlantic slave trade/Triangle Trade.</p>
<p><strong>Alcoholism</strong> is a significant problem in African communities. Just like <strong>Corned Beef 2000</strong>, globalization, and an introduction of Western goods into non-western regions has created both an imbalance and a dependency.</p>
<p>Anatsui’s cloths cause us to examine our conceptions of waste – appropriation/recycling of waste.</p>
<p>The title, <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> refers to the significance of textiles in African societies.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Part of a series called <strong>Gawu</strong> (the Ghanian word for metal cloth)</li>
<li>Pattern is based on <strong>kente cloth</strong> – traditional fabric in Ghana</li>
<li><strong>Gold colors</strong> also recall the colonial past of Ghana (previously called the Gold Coast by the British) until its independence in 1957.</li>
<li>The fluid movement of the work reminds  the viewer of the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, which carried slave ships and trade ships from Africa to the New World.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>El Anatsui</strong> was born in Ghana in 1944. He trained in an academic European-style academy. In 1964, when he was beginning art school, many parts of Africa were pushing for independence and decolonization. He joined the <strong>Sankofa</strong> movement which worked to unearth and reclaim Africa’s rich artistic tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Men in Ghana weave fabrics</strong>. This is highly unusual because globally, this tends to be a women’s tradition.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> Expansion of artist/art object, the revival of tradition and social critique.</p>
<p>The Met owns two of Anatsui’s metal wall hangings, but two separate departments purchased them: Arts of Africa and Modern/Contemporary Art. Which one is more appropriate and why?</p>

<p><strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> a work by artist <strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> was created using <strong>ink and acrylic on canvas</strong> and measures <strong>9 by 12 feet.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Total abstraction</li>
<li>Black lines create centrifugal structure</li>
<li>Various shards of color float over the work’s black skeleton</li>
<li>Notice gray painterly marks that rise from the lower registers to the upper registers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visually, the work looks like Kandinsky! </strong>How does Mehretu do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Overlaps architectural plans, urban plans, diagrams, photos, graffiti, maps, abstract shapes, etc. on top of one another to create an illusion of depth and movement</li>
<li>Built up in layers and layers of drawing, and then many applications of paint</li>
<li>Mixture of drawing and painting</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>portrays chaos in the modern world. </strong>It invokes our experiences of being in busy, in collective spaces. It captures the speed, energy, and chaos of a globalized, hectic world.</p>
<p>What are the results of our interconnectedness, our globalization?</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumerism (corporate logos)</li>
<li>National identities and propaganda</li>
<li>Religious symbols</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference to Kandinsky is important. Remember, Kandinsky and Mondrian believed pure abstraction could bring us together. Mehretu’s work is abstraction speaking about universalism and collectivity!</p>
<p>Title of the work, <strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> refers to arenas and stadiums</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Places where national identities, power, commerce, entertainment, sport, and conflict merge.</li>
<li>Should remind us of the circular spaces of a sports arena or amphitheater.</li>
<li>Imagine the energy of spectators, the matching colors, signs, and banners held overhead.</li>
<li>Visualization of the energy, sound, enthusiasm of a group of people</li>
<li>Colors allude to the French, Russian, American, Chinese, and Japanese flags, as well as there being crosses and corporate logos</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> is Ethiopian born and works in NYC with her partner who is also an artist.</p>
<p>Stadiums in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century are increasingly important spaces.  They are places for Olympics, nationalist fervor, other sports, religious gatherings, political rallies, and concerts.</p>
<p>In today’s world they are also places for <strong>terrorist attacks</strong> that focus on large numbers of people.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Brooklyn Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong> by Kenyan artist<strong> Wangechi Mutu </strong>is an artwork created by using<strong> mixed media on mylar.  </strong>Here she used collage incorporating fragments from fashion magazines, specially colored paper and more.  This was applied to mylar, which is a soft reflective piece of plastic. (Balloons are made of mylar.)</p>
<p>The work has drips of white ink on top of colors. This is reminiscent of stars and constellations, with the connection of human form to the universe.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This takes the attitudes of gender, sexuality, and the female nude and complicates them. We are used to docile, sexual, attractive white women. This woman seems powerful, engaged, confident, and not white.</p>
<p>There is a twist on the tradition of female nudes. It takes a woman who is passive and makes her active.  She is now preying on and ensnaring men.</p>
<p>When we view her, we assume she is not white. Why? How can we tell what race she is at all ? If we assume she isn’t white, we subject her to not only sexism but racism as well.</p>
<h5><strong>What’s in a Title?</strong></h5>
<p>The title <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong> reminds the viewer of a praying mantis, when looking at the female’s bent legs.  <strong>Praying mantises</strong> camouflage themselves, then snare prey with their enormous legs. During mating, a female praying mantis becomes a sexual cannibal.</p>

<p>Is the subject our prey? We prey on her by gazing on her, but she seems powerful, strong,  and confident. Is this a message about men falling prey to sexual women? She ensnares men, like her insect counterpart.</p>
<h5><strong>Juxtapositions</strong></h5>
<p>The woman is full of <strong>juxtapositions,</strong> and a hybrid-like figure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexualized yet legs tightly crossed</li>
<li>Human yet not human-like (more of a creature)</li>
<li>Relaxed yet exposed</li>
<li>Physical yet flayed</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Skinless</strong></h5>
<p>The inner flesh is on the outside of her body. Removing her skin removes the idea of race. Then, the viewer can just focus on the woman, regardless of race or identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>blanket</strong> represents <strong>kuba cloth</strong>, a Kenyan style of cloth.</p>
<p>The <strong>tree</strong> reminds us of creation myths. It also connects women to nature. Her left hand holds a <strong>small green serpent</strong> which links this woman with Eve. It joins her to Western tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Artist Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p>Artist <strong>Wangechi Mutu</strong> was born in Nairobi, Kenya but educated in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/247-artists.jpg?resize=247%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="247" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>She spoke about how one of the effects of colonialism in Africa was to introduce European or white narratives to African history and visual arts. This had the negative effect of Africans viewing their own art through a European lens.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is this Postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em> </strong>there is appropriation, change of tradition and an expansion of  the artist.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shibboleth</em></strong> by <strong>Doris Salcedo</strong> is an installation work of art measuring <strong>548 feet</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>temporary 548-foot-long series of fissures and cracks</strong> of varying width was in the floor of the gallery. This made viewers question it. Is it sculpture? Is it installation? Is it architecture?</p>
<p>Can you make art by breaking it? This is so different from the “art is constructed/made” mentality.  Particularly with buildings, we associate cracks with structural cracks and danger. The crack was filled in but is still visible.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Produced for the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall (main hall).</li>
<li>Salcedo says this represents the immigrant experience and visibly shows separations, cracks, lack of unity.</li>
<li>Calls attention to divisions in ethnicity, politics, class, and culture.</li>
<li>Immigration marks people as “broken,” not “wholly a part of the group”.</li>
<li>Scars are a symbol of damage but also of the possibility of healing. Figurative and literal wounds, but also figurative and literal closure. That scar will always be there, always acting as a reminder.  We can cross over the divide to enact healing.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Shibboleth</strong> was the word used to distinguish people who belong from those who do not</p>
<p>Among the US military, the word lollapalooza was used during WWII since its tricky pronunciation could identify Asian speakers very clearly.</p>

<p>Salcedo was a Columbian immigrant living in the US and Europe</p>
<p>This work shows the fear of vulnerability, fear of being seen as different, as other, as an outcast, or as an immigrant. Sometimes there is a real danger to being seen as a foreigner and to being exposed. This speaks to the immigrant/refugee crises in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, but really since WWII.</p>
<p>Why is this post-modernism?  There is an enlarge definition of art object/artist, globalization and social critique.</p>

Revival of tradition</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> was in the Tate Modern Turbine Hall</p>
<p><strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds)</em></strong> by Chinese artist <strong>Ai Weiwei</strong> is a work that consists of <strong>100 million sunflower seeds</strong> made from <strong>sculpted and painted porcelain. </strong>Each was handcrafted and hand painted. Each one is essentially individual and unique.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2020" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/250-Seeds.jpg?resize=820%2C469&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="820" height="469" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/250-Seeds.jpg?w=820&amp;ssl=1 820w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/250-Seeds.jpg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/250-Seeds.jpg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/250-Seeds.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The artist worked with 1600 artisans in Jingdzhen, the city known as the “Porcelain Capital” where Chinese artists produced pottery for 2,000 years. <strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds) </em></strong>provided employment for people in this city, while Ai Weiwei oversaw the production.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this work Post-Modern?</strong> This is a global artist, with a new art object, representing social critique, with a revival of tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The work is a critique on political and economic injustice. There is a sense of the small, tiny parts that make up the whole. Though each is incredibly small, they create a feeling of vastness.</p>
<p>Here there is a comparison between the individual vs. the group. The individual seed is lost among the millions. The critique of conformity and censorship is inherent in modern China. People who are unique must be the ones to cause change.</p>
<p>The artists used traditions of the past (traditional ceramic art) to critique Mao and communist history.</p>
<p>Mao tried to destroy traditional Chinese traditions and art. He failed.</p>
<p>People could touch, lay, walk on, and interact with the work. The viewer became a part of the experience. Initially, this was allowed but about a week into the exhibition, they realized this was crushing the seeds and the ceramic dust was toxic.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>100 million individual sunflower seeds weighing 150 tons</li>
<li>Each sunflower seed is porcelain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why sunflower seeds?</strong> Sunflower seeds evoke Mao’s Communist propaganda (Mao was rendered as the sun and the citizens were sunflowers, turning their faces to Mao. Seeds show the promise of something that can grow and become. Seeds make plants self-perpetuating, but these seeds cannot grow anything.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a symbol of imperial culture in China. It was an important way that the West began to be exposed to Chinese art. The use of porcelain also comments on the long history of this prized material while also cleverly still being “Made in China”.</p>
<p>In the Cultural Revolution, Mao tried to destroy these traditions by destroying Chinese art. In 2011, Ai Weiwei was arrested for three months. He was released due to pressure from the art world. On his blog, he investigated the cover-ups and corruption in the government’s handling of a 2008 earthquake in China, as well as the country’s hosting of the Olympics.</p>

<p>The Chinese Cultural Revolution led to Ai Weiwei’s father, an esteemed poet in China, being sent to a communist labor camp. Before he died, Ai Weiwei’s father gave his son permission to speak out about Mao’s injustices and conformity in China. Ai Weiwei is following a Confucian tenet&#8211;respect for elders.</p>

<h5><strong>Theme: “Pluralism”</strong></h5>
<p>Multiple styles existed at once, and many artists participated in more than one style.  Most artists do not fit neatly into any given “category” or “style.” Experimentation and social statements are key.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Context (1940-1990)</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">WWII and its devastation were powerful catalysts that drove artists to pursue abstraction.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Later, TV, computer, and digital media changed people’s social interactions, and information about the world around them.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The center of the art world moved from Paris to New York after WWII. New York was the financial and cultural capital of the world.</li>
<li>Many artists moved to New York to embark upon their careers.</li>
<li>Artists pursued abstraction in both painting and sculpture.</li>
<li>Modern architecture was radically altered by the introduction of the computer and 3D imaging.</li>
<li>Modern sculpture had abandoned marble as artists used more industrial materials.</li>
</ul>

<p>Critics had declared the figure obsolete in painting.  Instead of abandoning the subject, <strong>de Kooning</strong> readdressed this subject in a series of six paintings. This is the first.</p>
<ul>
<li> “Female painted through the ages” – timelessness</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Repeats tradition in showing us a female nude!</li>
<li>Aggressive, hulking, menacing, vengeful, wild-eyed figure of a sexualized woman

</li>
<li>An amalgam of female archetypes, from Paleolithic fertility goddesses to 1950s pinup girls (smile influenced by ad of women selling Camel cigarettes)</li>

<h5><strong>About Abstract Expressionism </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Abstract Expressionism </strong>started in NYC in late 40s and early 50s. It focused on total <strong>abstraction with no reference to representation</strong>, but applied paint to the canvas in a rough, physical manner a la Expressionism.</p>
<p>The theory was this nonrepresentational manner of painting would allow the artist to draw out greater truths and inner ideas. The image was <strong>not preconceived</strong>. It was the result of the creative process and the artist’s impulse.</p>
<p>This was the reaction to WWII and American regionalism. There was a feeling of despair.</p>
<h5><strong>Willem De Kooning</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Willem de Kooning (1904-1997) </strong>was born in the Netherlands. In 1926, he arrived in America, penniless and unable to speak English. He joined AbEx painters but differed in that he applies the Expressionist technique to figures.</p>
<p>The female figure was the subject he was most interested in and has caused much debate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I never was interested in how to make a good painting…,” he once said. “I didn’t work on it with the idea of perfection, but to see how far one could go…” Willem de Kooning</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>The Bay</em></strong> a work of <strong>acrylic on canvas</strong> by <strong>Helen Frankenthaler</strong> measures <strong>six feet eight inches by six feet and nine inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Color Field</strong> is a classification of painting which is achieved through “fields” of color.  The only subject is the color and it is in a non-representational form.</p>
<p><strong>Acrylic</strong> is a fast-drying paint. It is water-soluble, so it can be kept rich and thick, or loosened to have a watercolor look.</p>
<p>To <strong>soak stain</strong> the artist uses diluted acrylic paint, thinned with turpentine so it will run. Here, <strong>Frankenthaler </strong>poured paint onto the canvas. Then, the canvass was lifted and tilted at various angles so the paint would flow across the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Action painting</strong> is the physical manner of applying paint, then picking up the canvas and letting the paint drip across the surface. It is a combination of the unpredictability of gravity and the artist’s control.</p>

<h5><strong>What is our physical response to color?</strong></h5>
<p>We respond to colour in this painting in the same way we might respond to a sunset stained-glass window. These examples illustrate that colors do not have to represent something in particular, but they can instead have an ambiguous quality.</p>
<p>The goal is for the viewer to focus purely on the colors and shapes in the work.</p>
<h5><strong>Colours Chosen by the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>The painting includes different shades of blue, grey, green, and brown.</p>
<h5><strong>In Frankenthaler’s Own Words</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>In a 1965 interview for <em>Artforum Magazine</em> <strong>Helen Frankenthaler</strong> said, “<em>When you first saw an Impressionist painting, there was a whole way of instructing the eye. Dabs of color were understood to stand in for real things. It was a guitar or a hillside. The opposite is going on now. If you have bands of blue, green, and pink, the mind doesn’t first think sky, grass, and flesh. These are colors and now the question is what are they doing with themselves and with others.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Historical Notes </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frankenthaler</strong> was one of the handful of women among the traditional all boys’ club of the <strong>Abstract Expressionists</strong></li>
<li>Clement Greenberg (art critic) believed that if art made after WWII was going to have any real impact on the world, it would have to radically change and truly move towards the abstract.</li>
<li>Post WWII despair led to an interest in abstraction (remember this same thing happens after WWI).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pop Art </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> began in Britain in the mid-1950s. The term was coined by British critic, Lawrence Alloway, in referred to popular mass culture and imagery of the contemporary urban environment.</p>

<p><em><strong>Balloon Dog (Magenta)</strong></em> created between 1994 and 2000 C.E. <strong>by Jeff Koons, </strong>emphasizes the influence of pop culture.</p>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> illustrates everyday objects and transforms them into art objects in a disarming way. This raises the question of what defines an “acceptable art object”. Abstract art was accused of losing touch with reality. A dog made of stainless steel and resembling a child&#8217;s party toy crafted from balloons has maybe too much “reality” in it.</p>

The Balloon Dog(Magenta) of Koon is not just any “reality” it is an American one. In no other culture the children parties are not celebrated in such an elaborate manner and with such a multitude of glamorous, yet cheap mass-produced objects. Just like pop-art, children parties use mass produced objects and are designed to appeal to the largest possible audience. The glossy texture of the dog and its strange bright magenta color both suggest the mass-production and are reminiscent of the kitsch souvenirs. Balloon-animals and party favors in general are part of any American childhood. Thus, the sculpture combines two other characteristics of the pop-art the immense capital of something that it is recogniz- able has on selling art and the questionable taste of such a kitsch object." data-userid="928984894598709248" data-orgid="928984895668256768"><em><strong>Balloon Dog (Magenta)</strong></em> by <strong>Koons</strong> is <strong>not just any “reality” it is an American one.</strong>  Only in American culture are parties for children celebrated in such an elaborate manner.

<p><strong><em>Marilyn Diptych </em></strong>by <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> is an artwork created with <strong>oil, acrylic, and silk-screen enamel on canvas</strong>. It measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches by 8 feet 8 inches. </strong></p>
<p>A<strong> diptych</strong>: two panels meant to be viewed together.</p>
<p><strong>Enamel</strong> is an opaque shiny colored glass powder that begins as a liquid and hardens.</p>
<p><strong>Warhol </strong>developed the technique of projecting photographic images to <strong>silk screen. </strong>It enabled him to produce repetitive patterns using a stencil.</p>

<p>To create art like this, mesh cloth is stretched over a heavy wooden frame. The design is printed using a <strong>squeegee </strong>to force color through the pores of the material. The canvas sits underneath and the ink squeezes through to make the image. Any mistakes are a result of the process, rather than with the artist. Ultimately, the artist becomes a machine, removed from the process of intimate artmaking.</p>
<p>It was inspired by Abstract Expressionists in terms of scale only and announces that the subject is grandiose. The all over composition, allows the viewer’s eye to wander.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was this Work Made?</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Commemoration of movie star Marilyn Monroe after her death.</li>
<li>It takes an image that ALREADY existed and which the artist did not create.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1905" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147.-Marilyn.jpg?resize=572%2C236&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="572" height="236" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147.-Marilyn.jpg?w=572&amp;ssl=1 572w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147.-Marilyn.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Profitability</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Warhol</strong> showed he could profit off a celebrity’s image. The silkscreen medium allowed for multiple works and therefore multiple profits. Additionally, he had assistants make the silkscreens for him!</p>
<h5><strong>Ruminate on the Notion of Duality</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Satisfaction vs. Desensitization/Boredom</li>
<li>We want images of celebrities but after we get them, we are indifferent</li>
<li>Our lives really don’t change in any meaningful way</li>
<li>He captures our indifference to her image. Does it really matter that there are 50 instead of 1?</li>
<li>American life is depersonalized and repetitive</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1907" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147.-Viewed.jpg?resize=600%2C431&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="431" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147.-Viewed.jpg?w=571&amp;ssl=1 571w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147.-Viewed.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Obsession and Religion</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Obsession with celebrity vs. obsession with religion. Warhol struggled with his Catholic faith.</li>
<li>Our obsession with celebrity borders on the religious. That is why he uses a diptych, commonly reserved for religious imagery.</li>
<li>Use of <strong>gold is deliberately reminiscent of Byzantine icons</strong></li>
<li>Invites us to <strong>worship</strong> Marilyn as we would Mary</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1906" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147-Movie-Poster.jpg?resize=397%2C529&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="397" height="529" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147-Movie-Poster.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147-Movie-Poster.jpg?resize=768%2C1026&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/147-Movie-Poster.jpg?w=976&amp;ssl=1 976w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Celebrity Persona vs Death</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Contrast of vivid color with black and white and the fading in the right panel are suggestive of her mortality (Marilyn had in fact just died of suicide)</li>
<li>She is right in front of us (celebrities live on in images) but disappearing (her body does not exist anymore)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Details </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>50 images</strong> (25 color, 25 black and white) of Marilyn’s publicity photograph from the 1953 film <em>Niagara.</em></li>
<li><strong>Her image: </strong>seductive, heavy-lidded eyes, parted plump lips</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Rest of the Story</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> argued that <strong>our obsessions and culture</strong> are exalted enough that they can be ennobled into art. This way, Pop Art shows us what matters to us.</p>
<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> died in August, 1962 of apparent suicide. Warhol’s artwork was made just a few months later.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Before becoming a leading artist in the Pop Art movement of the 1960s, American-born <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> <strong>(1928-1987)</strong> was an illustrator for both print magazines, as well as advertising.</p>

<p><strong>Warhol</strong> was noted for using everyday objects in his work. Examples includes the pieces like <em>Campbell’s Soup Cans</em>. As noted above, his works often include celebrities such as movie star Elizabeth Taylor, Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones, and rock legend Elvis Presley.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks </em></strong>by <strong>Claes Oldenburg</strong> is made from<strong> Cor-Ten steel, steel, aluminium, and cast resin. </strong>It is<strong> painted with polyurethane enamel </strong>and stands<strong> 24 feet tall. </strong></p>
<p>The original version was made of inexpensive materials including plywood tracks. It was not initially intended to be permanent and was damaged buy both deterioration and vandalism.</p>
<p>The new construction began with stronger materials. <strong>Cor-Ten steel</strong> rusts and eliminates the need for paint as the rust becomes the color.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this Art was Made </strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks </em></strong>was originally commissioned by students from the Yale School of Architecture to disrupt a public space, create a political statement, and to be used as a platform for public speakers, while making anti-war speeches.</p>
<p>It was placed in <strong>Beinecke Plaza on the Yale Campus</strong> and overlooked the office of Yale’s president and a WWI memorial on campus. The red lipstick was originally meant to be deflated when the platform was not in use and inflated to get students’ attention.</p>

<p>The work was a satirical comment on the Vietnam War with hawkish, hyper-masculine rhetoric of the military verses a feminine tube of lipstick. It was <strong>a comment on masculinity and femininity</strong> with the traditional masculinity of war (hard, gritty, violent) verses traditional femininity of lipstick (sensual, soft, alluring).</p>
<p>The inclusion of lipstick in this work also took on an additional meaning in <strong>commemoration of Yale becoming a coeducational university</strong>. It allowed female students into the undergrad programs for the first time <strong>in 1969</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Backgrounder </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> was a growing trend in <strong>American artwork</strong> in the 1950s and 1960s. It <strong>elevated the everyday</strong> and made these subjects appropriate for fine art.</p>
<p><strong>The Vietnam War</strong> was escalating at the time the work was created. There were many protests on college campuses against the war. Yale was one of those places.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>Swedish-born conceptual/pop artist <strong>Claes Oldenburg </strong>was born in 1929. He began proposing large-scale sculptures of everyday objects as a tribute to American consumer culture.  He is known for his ingenious, oversized renditions of ordinary objects elevated to a grand size (art historical tradition tells us if the artwork is large, it must be significant).</p>

<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> by artist <strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was made entirely of reflective <strong>mirror balls</strong> of highly polished stainless steel. Each mirror ball measured eight inches across. There was a total of 1500 balls in the original <strong>installation</strong>. Later, she would recreate the installation around the globe in a multitude of versions and settings.</p>

<p>This work is considered <strong>performance art</strong>. This means artwork that is a performance, time sensitive, and only preserved in photographs. In this case, viewers could see themselves and their surroundings in the work. It expressed the idea of illusion and infinity.</p>
<h5>Based on Mythology</h5>
<p>The title of this work has a reference to the classics. <strong>Narcissus</strong> the mythological hunter, fell in love with his reflection in a pool. <strong>Narcissism</strong> is the egotistical admiration of one’s own self.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1914" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/148-Original-Story.jpg?resize=750%2C457&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="457" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/148-Original-Story.jpg?w=463&amp;ssl=1 463w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/148-Original-Story.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Message</strong></h5>
<p>The work was a critique of the narcissism of art world and commercialization. Monetary exchange between Kusama and her customers underscored the economic system in art production and exhibition.</p>
<p>It also spoke of the pressure on artists to sell artwork, an experience, their brand, and the need for self-promotion. They must market and promote themselves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> became more and more popular. The balls became collector’s items.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> was first installed in the <strong>Venice Biennale</strong>, a major contemporary art show in 1966. Yet, the artists had not officially been invited to exhibit!</p>
<p>This work of<strong> performance art </strong>was originally on a grass lawn on which <strong>Kusama</strong> set 1,500 mirror balls on. She was dressed in a gold kimono. Each ball was sold for 1,200 lira ($2). There was a sign that said, “Your narcissism for sale!”</p>

<p>Venetian authorities reprimanded her and fined her.</p>
<p>A<strong> happening is a term</strong> coined in late 1950s to describe performance art that is initially planned but <strong>involves spontaneity, improvisation, and audience participation</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was born in 1929. She is a self-taught artist who has now chosen to live in a Tokyo mental facility.</p>
<p>She had difficulty finding acceptance in the art world as both a woman and foreigner. She also lived in a society recovering from WWII prejudice against Japan.</p>
<p>Mirrors and repetition are a theme in her artwork, as she says it helps her to process her insanity. She reminds the viewer that <strong>Pop Art didn’t just focus on consumer culture (celebrities, soup cans) but also on our own vanity and ego</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Spiral Jetty</em></strong> by artist<strong> Robert Smithson </strong>is an<strong> Earthwork </strong>made from <strong>mud, precipitated salt crystals, rocks, and water coil, </strong>located in<strong> Great Salt Lake, Utah, US. </strong>It measures<strong> 1,500 feet long.</strong></p>
<p>An<strong> Earthwork</strong> is a site-specific piece, set outdoors in the West made of natural materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiral Jetty </em></strong><strong>is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Located at Rozel Point peninsula on the Northeast shore of the Great Salt Lake</li>
<li>All materials are from this site</li>
<li>Over 6,000 tons of black basalt rock</li>
<li>Coil is 1,500 feet long and 15 feet wide that winds counterclockwise off the shore into the water</li>
<li>Dump trucks and tractors took six days</li>
<li>The <strong>artist was insistent</strong> about switching rocks around to create the look he wanted</li>
<li><strong>Water level varies</strong> with precipitation in the mountains
<ul>
<li><strong>Jetty is revealed in times of drought and submerged in times of normal precipitation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lake is naturally pink or red</strong> due to bacteria and algae that thrive in the saline water</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Who was this Work Made For?</strong></h5>
<p>This is a question that many people ask. The <strong>location is remote</strong> (100 miles NW of Salt Lake City) and <strong>difficult to get to</strong> (a 15-mile dirt road from highway with potholes so big VW beetles get stuck in them).</p>
<p>This work <strong>challenges traditional notions about art in a gallery space</strong>. It also expands the definition of the art object.</p>
<p><strong>Spiral Jetty </strong>requires the viewer’s engagement to walk out along it and experience it.</p>
<h5><strong>A Disappearing Medium</strong></h5>
<p>Also, this work does not have the power of longevity. <strong>Entropy</strong> is the decline into disorder, inevitability of time and the disintegration of all objects in nature. It is the power of natural forces over man-made forces. The jetty will naturally disappear over time.</p>
<p>Originally the work was almost all black basalt, but salt encrustation has turned it a pinkish white.</p>
<p>Not only will nature erode its own work, but human experience (viewers walking) will erode it too.</p>
<p>This draws attention to <strong>environmental issues</strong>. What is our human effect on the environment? How can we preserve it?</p>
<h5><strong> C</strong><strong>ontent</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Spiral Jetty </strong>is a three-part artwork:</p>
<ol>
<li>sculpture</li>
<li>essay by Smithson</li>
<li>film documenting the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>coil shape</strong>, Smithson believed, was a shape that was natural and organic. Unlike Modernist squares and circles and more geometric forms, <strong>coils suggest growth and decay</strong>, a perpetual cycle</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>Smithson <strong>leased the site</strong> for a small annual fee and <strong>contracted the construction</strong> with money given to him by a New York gallery. He was interested in this site because it was where an abandoned industrial site had left machinery on the coast to decay. This made him think about decay and man versus nature. Also, the American Southwest had vast open spaces, seen as quintessential in unspoiled nature.</p>
<p>The sculpture is now owned by the state of Utah.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Artist Robert Smithson started out creating paintings and collages before moving to sculpture, which he assembled using scattered materials. Soon, he moved his works out of galleries and into landscapes.</p>
<p>He was best known for his <strong>Earthwork</strong> or <strong>Land art.</strong></p>
<p>Smithson died in a plane crash in 1973. He was 35.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> by<strong> Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>was a<strong> mixed-media installation </strong>that was placed in<strong> New York City, US and spanned 23 miles long </strong>as a work of<strong> site-specific art. </strong></p>
<p>The installation was comprised of<strong> 7,503 gates across footpaths in Central Park</strong>. Each <strong>16-foot-tall gate</strong> had a piece of <strong>saffron colored fabric</strong> hanging to 7 feet above ground level. The widths of the gates matched the widths of the walkways. Gates were set down to avoid drilling.  The structures formed an oval path that intersected. There was no start or ending points.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> introduced eye-catching color into the landscape and infused light into a winter scene. Orange contrasted with brown and gave off the “spring is coming” vibe.</p>
<p>The work was temporary with all materials intended for recycling or sale.</p>

<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The installation was free to the public. The artists wanted to alter the experience of walking in the park to be an original, temporary experience. A golden ceiling creating warm shadows for visitors, as well as a refuge from city life. It encouraged people to go outdoors. It made people look and drew attention to the landscape.</p>
<p>In aerial view. <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> looked like a golden river that appeared and disappeared among the trees in the park.</p>
<p>How does art respond to and impact our relationship with the built environment? What is natural? What is “constructed”?</p>
<p>This work helped to move visitors from being unaware of their surroundings to aware and engaged.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Gates</strong> was only exhibited from February 12<sup>th</sup> – February 27<sup>th</sup>, 2005, in Central Park.</p>

<p>The fabric moved organically with the wind. Light moved through it mirroring the visitors’ movement underneath it.</p>
<p>The installation was inspired by Japanese Shinto tradition of torii (gates) that mark the transition at shrines from the secular to the sacred.</p>

<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>The husband-and-wife artist team of  <strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>developed the concept for the art installation in 1979. It was not produced until 2005. For this reason, we can consider it as linked to environmental/site-specific art of the 1970s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1941" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1941" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1941" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=635%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="635" height="424" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?w=1787&amp;ssl=1 1787w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1941" class="wp-caption-text">Christo and Jeanne-Claude</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> cost $21 million. The artist financed the project themselves. There were no sponsors, instead they self-fund every project and sold merchandise related to the exhibition. Part of the costs of the work were wages for 600 workers to install it. The team also paid for security guards at night.</p>
<p>The artists had to submit proposals, attend meetings, and make presentations to  both the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy administration. In 1982, they received a 251-page rejection.</p>
<p>The election of Michael Bloomberg, in 2001, who was a fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, was the turning point.</p>
<p>Central Park was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was meant as a city refuge. It recalled ideas of the Victorian pastoral and picturesque.</p>
<p>People criticized <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> for interfering with man’s relationship with nature. But the irony is that Central Park itself was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as a city refuge.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Neo-Expressionism?</strong></h4>

Portrait</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> The Broad in LA</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players </em></strong>by artist <strong>Jean-Michel </strong>Basquiat is an <strong>acrylic and oil paintstick on three canvas panels</strong> measuring <strong>18 feet by 6 feet 3 inches.  Paintstick</strong> is a “crayon” with various oils/pigments mixed in. This allows the artist to draw oil paint.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> is a<strong> triptych</strong> with a flat, dark background color uniting all three panels. Each canvas has flat patches of color and dense thick lines.</p>
<p>This <strong>Neo-Expressionism</strong> work retains rough handling, jagged forms and jarring color, but now has a focus on the body. Pride of place has made an exit as the important figures are off to the sides. Large sections of white paint seem to obscure what was underneath.</p>
<p>There is no sense of scale or balance. The artist relies heavily on juxtaposition and contrast to make the painting dynamic and expressive. The traditional approach to 3D space is gone.</p>
<h5><strong>What is the Function of <em>Horn Players</em>?</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This work connects <strong>graffiti with jazz and fine art. </strong>Through this it elevates the practice of graffiti itself to a fine art. It also connects <strong>jazz to African American culture</strong> thereby honoring African American history and contributions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Player</em></strong>s was inspired by the scatting and improvisational work performed in jazz. <strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> replicates that technique here.</p>

<h5><strong>Up Close </strong></h5>
<p>On the <strong>left panel</strong> Charlie Parker (saxophonist) plays his instrument and emits hot pink notes and sounds. On the <strong>central panel</strong> an abstracted head floats in space.</p>
<p>On the <strong>right panel</strong> Dizzy Gillespie (trumpeter) holds his trumpet along his side. The words DOH SHOO DE OBEE floats to the left. This reminds the viewer of Gillespie’s scat as a wordless improvisation.</p>
<h5><strong>Wordplay </strong></h5>
<p>A number of words appear on the canvases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dizzy</li>
<li>Ornithology (study of birds, as well as the title of a famous composition by Charlie Parker in reference to his own nickname Bird)</li>
<li>Pree (Parker’s daughter)</li>
<li>Teeth</li>
<li>Alchemy</li>
<li>Feet</li>
<li>Soap</li>
<li>Larynx misspelled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wordplay</strong> is a characteristic of <strong>Basquiat’s </strong>work, yet not all fully understood.</p>
<h5><strong>Common Subject Matter</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Musicians </strong>were a common subject for <strong>Basquiat</strong>. He had briefly played in a band. <strong>Anatomical terms</strong> were also common. His mother bought him a <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> textbook as a child for fun.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity to Picasso’s <em>Horn Players</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on <strong>Basquiat</strong> being called the black Picasso</li>
<li>We must draw upon our knowledge of traditional painting to understand this work</li>
<li>Triptych format echoes the trio of figures</li>
<li>Parker is in the same position as the standing figure with the clarinet in Picasso’s work</li>
<li>Central figure in Basquiat’s work is likened to the distorted face of the middle figure in Picasso’s</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Emergence of Urban Graffiti</strong></h5>
<p>Urban graffiti was an emerging artform in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Basquiat was one of the leaders.</p>
<h5><strong>About Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong></h5>
<p>Basquiat was a homeless NYC queer man of color. He was a <strong>graffiti artist, sex worker and poet</strong>. Discovered in 1981 at age 20, he became dazzlingly successful at a quick speed.</p>
<p>He was known for his tag SAMO (Same Old Shit) written in marker and spray paint on subway trains, sidewalks, and gallery walls. This attracted the attention of gallery owners and the art world.</p>
<p>Based on his success, critics referred to him as the “black Picasso”. While this likened him to Picasso, Basquiat felt conflicted about this term, because the word black was added.</p>
<p>He once said, “If you wanna talk about influence, man, then you’ve got to realize that influence is not influence. It’s simply someone’s idea going through my new mind.”</p>
<p>Some of his paintings have sold for $20 million. The artist died at the age of 27 from a heroin overdose.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Art News Update!</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Andy Warhol’s portrait of Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong> was up for auction at Christie’s in November 2021.  The pre-estimate was US$20 million.</p>
<p>“From Brooklyn to China, Basquiat symbolizes a new generation, and Warhol recognized this earlier than anyone. His unmatched ability to capture celebrity, fame, glory, and tragedy culminates in this portrait,” Alex Rotter, Christie’s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art, said in a statement. “Just as much about Basquiat as it is about Warhol, it is one of the most exciting paintings to come to the auction market.”</p>
<p>How much did it sell for? <strong>$40,091,500!</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Androgyne III</em></strong> by artist<strong> Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>is a work comprised of<strong> burlap, resin, wood, nails, and string </strong>measuring<strong> 4 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> burlap</strong> is manipulated into a figurative composition. It is meant to appear rough and course. This is  an abstracted, simplified, dramatically reduced figure that is hollow with no head, forearms, or shins. A mold process was used to make the form out of burlap, with resin to stiffen it.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round</strong> and should also be viewed from the back.</p>

<h5><strong>Why is this Neo-Expressionism? </strong></h5>
<p>This work is a return to the body and the expressive capabilities of the bodies. This was believed to have had been lost in Pop Art and Site-Specific Art. It is a rejection of the modernist attitude that the body is dead. Additionally, the style is a revival of Expressionism, with rough, jagged handling, and sharp forms.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This work examines the <strong>relationship between individual and community</strong> (isolation and loss). It notes <strong>dehumanization and lack of identity</strong> are the result of strife, war, anguish, derision.</p>
<p>It <strong>depicts isolation and loss</strong> in a universal way. We cannot identify this figure specifically. So much of this figure has been lost, destroyed, and hurt. Our own identities become lost and are vulnerable in our modern, violent worlds.</p>
<p><strong>We identify and recognize this figure</strong> even though we see SO little of it. Destruction leaves us as shells of who we once were.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>androgynous figure</strong> focuses on humanity, rather than gender. Notice the body language. The shoulders are pulled forward, with a slumping back.</p>
<p>The figure in deep despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>wrinkled skin</li>
<li>backbone</li>
<li>musculature</li>
<li>veins</li>
<li>missing limbs and head</li>
</ul>
<p>It is elevated from the floor by a wood structure as base. Does this fill in for the legs?  Is this a wheelchair? Gurney?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Androgyne III</em> Comparison</strong></p>
<p>Human condition is a constant preoccupation of post-modern art. Once the artists started questioning the constraints the society imposes on humans, they never stopped attacking its pre-constructed judgements.</p></blockquote>
<p>To the Polish artist <strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz</strong> it is important to reflect on dehumanization and the loss of individuality in the modern society. The artwork <strong><em>Androgyne II</em></strong> was created in 1985, during widespread food shortages. Numerous hunger demonstrations were sweeping Poland and people could not even buy even rationed foods. The demonstrations were silent and comprised of men, women, and children.</p>
<p>As a reaction to the Communist propaganda which depicted happy smiling workers, she created a series of <strong>neo-expressionist sculptures</strong> based on fibers. <strong><em>Androgyne II</em></strong> was molded in burlap, simplified, hollowed and rendered headless and armless. The figure is carried on symbolic stretchers.</p>
<p>We are still able to identify and recognize the destructed body as a human, but we cannot identify the figure specifically. The focus is on the humanity of the figure, on the suffering to which the androgyne is subjected and makes his/her shoulders be pulled forward.</p>
<p>The wrinkled skin and backbone lead us to see the person as the result of a destruction process. We are invited to think of the living process that tore apart our identities to the point of being lost and extremely vulnerable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, El Anatsui the artist behind the post-modernist artwork <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth (2003)</em></strong> provokes a discussion on the continued impact of European slave trade, exploitation of the people of Ghana and Africa in general. <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> is not a fiber work, even though it preserves a lot of the qualities of Kente traditional textiles that inspired it. It is made from bottle caps found in the Ghana bush to emphasize the alcohol consumption problem created by the introduction of European alcohol as part of the slave trade.</p>
<p>It is gold like, just like the gold that the British extracted from Ghana until its post WWII independence. It is not precious. It is only an illusion. This illusory and precarious aspect is also suggested by the fact the “cloth” comes with no hanging indications and thus each exhibit curator can find her/his own patterns. Nevertheless, the carefulness of the assembly suggests that the spirit of the nation is not broken and it can be rekindled.</p>
<p>The revival of the tradition is the artist’s deep hopes. He joined the Sankofa movement that re- claimed Africa’s rich traditional culture.</p>
<p>By trying to find meaning and hope in ugliness or discarded debris the artists expand the materials that can be used to create art and repudiate the categories of beautiful and ugly. By avoiding a clear finished state of their artworks, these artists fit into what is called “brut art”. They try to provoke raw emotions and challenge the definition of acceptable human life in the viewer.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>was considered <strong>a pioneer of fiber-based sculpture. </strong>Her art was affected by her experiences in Poland, under Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II.</p>
<p>Born in 1930, she lived on a large estate in Poland. Here she often played in the woods. She said this later inspired her to use natural materials in her works.</p>
<p>In WWII, German tanks entered her family’s estate. Later a drunk German soldier burst into the house and shot off her mother’s arm in front of her. In 1944, the family fled, as the Soviet army arrived and moved into Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>Abakanowicz</strong> worked as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded. This would later affect her art.</p>
<p>When the war was over, she attended art school at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Warsaw. Poland was a part of the Soviet Bloc. Social Realism was the style taught in art schools with smiling workers and images of a perfect society. She tried to avoid learning this style by choosing to work with textiles. Yet,  she had to adopt it to obtain a degree and enter the Polish Artist Union.</p>

<p><strong><em>Electronic Superhighway</em></strong> by artist <strong>Nam June Paik</strong> is a <strong>mixed-media installation (49-channel closed-circuit video installation, neon, steel, and electric components)</strong> measuring 15 by 40 feet.</p>
<p>This huge, towering stack of TVs simultaneously shows multiple clips from a variety of sources. His studio was small, so he had to squish Texas and Florida. In total there are 336 TVs: 3,750 feet of cable and 575 feet of colored tubing.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist used video to show the speed of our increasingly <strong>electronic modern lives</strong>. It also celebrates an <strong>America influenced by film and television</strong>.</p>
<p>How have these things shaped who we think we are? How are we connected to each other via media? Is the effect of technology always a good thing? Can we have information overload?</p>
<p>This is <strong>a contrast between</strong> actual road trips, with a trip across the US in the gallery, with virtual travel on the Internet.</p>
<p>Notice the size and energy. All this plays into the American identity Paik was captivated by.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An <strong>enormous scale</strong> suggests the huge size of the nation. There is a map of the US with <strong>neon</strong> outlining the states. Neon reminded him of the signs for motels and restaurants that dot the highways. Different colors remind us that states have different identities.</p>
<p><strong>Images</strong> are flashing and rapidly changing. This is reminiscent of billboards being seen from passing cars.</p>
<p>Within each state, the screen displays video clips that resonate with each state’s own identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kansas: <em>Wizard of Oz </em>(film)</li>
<li>Oklahoma: <em>Oklahoma </em>(film)</li>
<li>Iowa: footage of presidential candidates</li>
<li>Idaho: potatoes</li>
<li>Missouri: <em>Meet Me in St. Louis </em>(film)</li>
<li>Texas: cowgirls, cactus</li>
<li>New York: Empire State Building</li>
<li>Maine: clips of a friend</li>
<li>California: hallucinogens, Golden Gate Bridge, OJ Simpson</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p>Nam June Paik was born in Seoul, in 1932. He was considered <strong>the father of video art</strong>, with his first video art exhibit in 1963.</p>
<p>When Paik came to the US In 1964, the interstate highway system was only 9 years old. Highways offered everyone the freedom to see the USA. Highways were new and heavily advertised, as a way for Americans to see the country on a limited budget.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Crossing</em></strong> by<strong> Bill Viola </strong>is a<strong> video/sound </strong>installation that uses a double-sided screen on a freestanding piece of clear acrylic. It was shot using high-speed film that achieved 300 frames per second in great detail. Viola reduced the speed of the playback to extremely slow motion. This enhances the drama. Sound amplifies the experience.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist wanted to create an immersive sound and video environment to dwell on transformation and change as well as growth and decay. These are inevitable processes.</p>
<p>Slow-motion is not just a technological choice. It is meant to invite a meditative and contemplative response. One that requires the viewer to concentrate for longer and slows us down. This increases our awareness of movement, detail, and change. This creates a connection between the artistic and spiritual experience. We could interpret it in a religious way, even though the work makes no direct iconographic or religious overtones.</p>

<p>There are two different video sequences that are simultaneously shown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Water + fire = duality</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>water video </strong>the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A trickle of water overhead appears until he disappears in a deluge. As the water ceases, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>In the <strong>fire video</strong> the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A flame starts at his feet and spreads over his legs and torso until he disappears in flames. As the fire dies down, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>This draws on universal truths about life and death from Eastern/Western traditions. Fire/water is a barrier between this world and the next. Humans struggle to survive both of these in disasters.</p>

<li>Describes a childhood experience of almost drowning as “beautiful” and “without fear”.</li>
<li>Viola is a devoted Zen Buddhist.</li>
<li>In college, he majored in religious studies, psychology, and electrical engineering&#8211; all clearly visible here.</li>
<li>Inspired by Nam June Paik, an early innovator in the field of video art.</li>
<li>Even though the art object has greatly changed, the themes of life, death, religion, redemption continue.</li>

<p><strong><em>Seagram Building </em></strong>in <strong>New York City </strong>was designed by <strong>architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, with interior furnishings by Philip Johnson</strong>. Constructed from <strong>steel with a glass curtain wall and bronze </strong>the building measures 515 feet tall with 38 stories. When it was constructed, the cost was astronomical an $36 million dollars.</p>
<p><em> </em><strong>Mies</strong> believed that “<strong>Less is More</strong>”</p>
<ul>
<li>Evokes the simplicity of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye and International Style</li>
<li>Symmetrical, sense of balanced proportion</li>
<li>Clean, simple, geometry</li>
<li>Vertical mullions rise without interruption (these are only decorative and part of the curtain-wall architecture)</li>
<li>Elegance of construction</li>
<li>Bronze mullions were rubbed with oil at least once a year, so they do not oxidize and become patina in color.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though we might think this was not classical because of its different color and lack of ornamentation, it invokes the classical precedent. These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bronze: common in Greek sculpture</li>
<li>Pillars in front of building are fluted</li>
<li>Building is set atop a base similar to a stylobate</li>
<li>There is a sense of symmetry and proportion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technological innovations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used glass and metal, not stone and brick</li>
<li><strong>Curtain-wall architecture</strong>: outermost walls are non-structural</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Office building for Seagram Liquor company (this was their headquarters)</li>
<li>Ushered in a new era of skyscrapers (minimalist geometries without ornament/detail)</li>
<li>Testament to just how influential the Seagram Building was that it now seems commonplace</li>
<li>Created standard for modern skyscraper</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This office building with an empty space in front was innovative and radical at the time. The open, urban plaza set the building back from Park Avenue and created a <strong>pedestrian space.  Inside</strong>, the building is luxurious in its use of <strong>bronze, travertine</strong>, and <strong>marble</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Office spaces were furnished by Philip Johnson</strong> who was the director of architecture at MOMA.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Notes</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Seagram,</strong> a large Canadian liquor company was the largest at that time. It flourished during prohibition because they were based in Canada, and not the United States.</p>
<p>The initial building pan was rejected by Phyllis Lambert, daughter of a Seagram owner. She was a Harvard architecture student and said the original design was the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She gave her father three choices of architects to employ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frank Lloyd Wright was rejected because at the age of 90 he was considered too old.</li>
<li>Le Corbusier was discovered to be too difficult to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</strong> was given the gig!</p>

<h5><strong>About the Architect</strong></h5>
<p>German-born architect<strong> Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</strong> was a director of a German architecture school called the Bauhaus. Nazis eventually shut down for being too modernist!</p>
<p>He came to the US in the late 1930s. His love of classical architecture and sculpture were his inspiration</p>

<p><strong><em>House in New Castle County</em></strong> by architects <strong>Robert Venturi, John Rauch, and Denise Scott Brown</strong> is a <strong>wood frame and stucco</strong> building in <strong>Delaware, US</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>“front” façade</strong> incorporates a floating arched screen in front of the home. This was done because the owners liked bird watching, and it camouflaged them. The <strong>“rear” façade</strong> was dominated by a <strong>pointed arch porch</strong> similar to a pediment and supported by four stubby flat “columns” that evoke the Doric order</p>
<p>The is no internal or external symmetry. It is unique and eclectic. Venturi said “<strong>Less is a Bore</strong>” in reaction to modernism and its simplicity.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>House in New Castle County</em></strong> was built as a private residence for a family of three who loved bird watching and music.</p>
<p>For Venturi, this is his summary of his Less is a Bore mentality. Rather than copy a specific style, he borrowed freely, juxtaposing, and reinterpreting different forms from other periods and styles</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Playfully eclectic</li>
<li>Mismatched architectural features</li>
<li><strong>Exterior:</strong> Like many traditional <strong>American farmhouses</strong> and barns, the siding is white and gabled roofs have unstained wooden shingles; <strong>Greek temple</strong> elements (columns, portico)</li>
<li><strong>Interior</strong>: shows a music room; vaulted ceiling; wood decorations like ribs in a <strong>Gothic</strong> church; quirky wooden chandelier; you can see windows, with patio and wooden arched screen; colors that are typical for <strong>Southwestern</strong> styles (peach, turquoise)</li>

<li>Venturi studied architecture at Princeton and the American Academy in Rome
<ul>
<li>Developed a preference for Mannerism and Baroque architecture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1966: published a book, <em>Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture</em> (very successful!)
<ul>
<li>Wanted to reject what Le Corbusier (house is a machine for living in) and van der Rohe (less is more) had done</li>
<li>Believed structures should have:
<ul>
<li>Contradictions (pieces that don’t traditionally go together)</li>
<li>Messy vitality &gt;  obvious unity</li>
<li>Embrace elements purely for their decorative elements/aesthetic purposes</li>
<li>Inspired by styles of the past (opposite of form follows function)</li>

<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em></strong><em> by </em><strong>Maya Lin</strong> is comprised of <strong>granite</strong> and stands in <strong>Washington D.C., US</strong>. <strong>Each arm is 246 feet by 9 inches long. </strong></p>
<p>This work is a highly reflective <strong>black granite</strong> formed into a <strong>V-shaped wall</strong>.  It is <strong>sunk into the land</strong> rather than set on top of it. The two walls point towards either the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument. Where the walls meet, they are 10.1 feet high. Each wall slopes at the ends to less than a foot and is covered with <strong>text only</strong>. There are <strong>no images</strong>.</p>
<p>The work was inspired by <strong>Minimalism</strong>. This art movement that begins in the 1960s in the US, aims to eliminate all non-essentials in an artwork by reducing it to its most simple geometric elements. It goes further than Cubism.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Lin had to create a way to <strong>commemorate loss</strong> without designing a memorial that would tell people what to think about Vietnam. It needed to be approachable and apolitical, with a focus on work being a place of mourning and healing.</p>
<p>The design does not aim to resolve conflicting emotions about the validity of the war. Instead, it is meant to be a space for catharsis, mourning and contemplation.</p>
<p>The viewer must engage with the work close up to interact with it. The reflection of the loved one’s name is a powerful reminder of their sacrifice for the country.</p>

<p>The <strong>sunken placement</strong> was meant to evoke <strong>a spiritual journey</strong> for the viewer. They enter and sink deeper to reflect on the death of the soldiers. The living are carrying on the memory.  It also signifies a deep cut in the earth that will heal over time, but <strong>there will always be a scar.</strong></p>
<p>The wall was intentionally made reflective and shiny. The names of the dead literally comprise our bodies’ reflection. The message is we are here because of their sacrifice.  While we see reflections, they are not as clear as a mirror.  It is as if we are gazing into a ghostly realm.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The single memorial device used is <strong>text not imagery.</strong> Visitors read the names of those lost, engraved in chronological order.</p>
<p><em>Thus, the war’s beginning and end meet; the war is ‘complete,’ coming full circle yet broken by the earth that bounds the angle’s open side and continued with the earth itself.</em></p>
<p>The work was intentionally shaped like a book. Visitors read names from left to right. <strong>There are 72 panels containing 58,286 names.</strong> These names are listed in order of when the men and women died or were declared missing. There have been periodic additions.</p>
<p>The growth of the structure <strong>perfectly parallels the number of deaths</strong>, almost like a timeline. The lowest number of deaths are shown at the beginning and end, with the greatest number in the middle.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial </em></strong><em>was </em>designed by a 21-year-old Yale University junior named <strong>Maya Lin</strong>, in 1981. She was still a student at Yale’s School of Architecture. The work was made for a public design competition. Her professor had assigned this as a project for his students. (Meanwhile, she only received a B+ grade on it from the professor!)</p>
<p>Her design was one of over 2,573 submissions, in response to a call for entries by the US government.</p>
<p>The idea came from the Yale Memorial Rotunda. Alumni who had been killed in war have their names inscribed on the walls. She used to touch the names and feel contemplative.</p>
<p>She did not do any specific research on the war because she felt politics had eclipsed the veterans. She wanted the focus to remain on the deceased.</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was a disaster on all counts. Most Americans believed the war was a moral tragedy. All of America knew it had been lost. Most opposed to the war did not blame the soldiers but the government, although some did attack soldiers or disrespect them upon their return. The vets were angry with the lack of respect and distraught about the great loss.</p>
<p>The average age of names on the wall is 19.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for a US soldier upon putting their boots on the ground in Vietnam was 1 month.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Vast Criticism</strong></h5>
<p>Lin was resoundingly criticized for this work.</p>
<p>The <strong>black color </strong>was said to not match with the rest of the US Mall. It was called “black gash on Mall”.</p>
<p>People interpreted the color black as a symbol of shame and dishonor over the war. Lin meant it as a sign of mourning. Additionally, black was seen as a color in Asian art, and was not typical in American, Western, or classical art&#8211;that color would have been white.</p>
<p>The work was considered <strong>nonrepresentational and not traditional</strong>.  It lacked ornamentation and did not follow traditional funerary sculpture. Many thought the design was too simple and did not depict honor and sacrifice in a traditional way.</p>
<p><strong>War veterans wanted a traditional and realistic sculpture</strong>. One is added off to the side to assuage concerns.</p>

<p>People wondered why a young Asian American woman from an Ivy League college who did not know the realities of war was the artist. Why would she be picked to design a monument about deaths in an Asian war?</p>
<p>Building permits were refused. It took a 4 Star Brigadier General to testify before subcommittee hearings and defend the color before the project moved forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maya Lin</strong><em> said, “It took me 9 months to ask the VVMF, in charge of building the memorial, if my race was an issue. It had never occurred to me that it would be, and I think they had taken all the measures they could to shield me from comments about a “gook” designing the memorial. I remember reading the article that appeared in The Washington Post referring to “An Asian Memorial for an Asian War” and I knew we were in trouble.”</em></p>
<p>She continued by saying<em>, “The controversy exploded in Washington after that. Ironically, one side attacked the design for being “too Asian,” while others saw its simplicity and understatement, not as an intention to create a more Eastern, meditative space, but as a minimalist statement which they interpreted as being non-referential and disconnected from human experience. This left the opinion in many that the piece emanated from a series of intellectualized aesthetic decisions, which automatically pitted artist against veterans. The fact that I was from an Ivy League college and had hair down to my knees further fueled this distrust of the design and suspicions of a hippie college liberal or aesthetic elitist forcing her art and commentary upon them.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> by American architect <strong>Frank Gehry</strong> was constructed using <strong>titanium, glass, and limestone</strong>. This example of Post-Modern architecture stands in <strong>Bilbao, Spain.</strong></p>
<p>Post-Modernism used organic, rounded forms with asymmetrical designs rather than Modernist crisp, clean, long, straight lines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1756" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1756" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1756" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-C.jpg?resize=750%2C582&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="582" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-C.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-C.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1756" class="wp-caption-text">Guggenheim Museum Bilbao site plan<br />© FMGB Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa</figcaption></figure>
<p>This style is called <strong>deconstructivism</strong>. There is a bending and twisting of traditional styles to create a new aesthetic. This creates an unstable environment with unusual spatial arrangements. It looks bulging, warped, curling, tumbling. This is surprising to us because the look of the building disrupts our assumption that architecture is inherently stable.</p>
<p><strong>Gehry</strong> described this work as “form follows fantasy”. It is a non-traditional building in both design and materials. He used a computer program called Catia, originally invented for aerospace engineering to design buildings.</p>
<p>The shiny titanium tiles that sheathe the building give it strength and shine. The look was inspired by the scales of fish. The fishing industry/shipbuilding industry was once a major part of Bilbao’s economy.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This building was constructed to serve as <strong>a museum of modern and contemporary art.</strong> The Guggenheim collection in NYC was too large for their space. This housed the overflow.</p>
<p>This building challenged the traditions of museum design and the thinking that it should be classical in form.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1754" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-B.jpg?resize=489%2C734&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="489" height="734" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> is based on the curvature of the Guggenheim Museum in NYC. It also takes design cues from the Italian Baroque style of drapery and fabric, with bending, rippling, and unfurling.</p>
<p>Notice how the building looks like a ship. It is set by the water. The reflective quality of the building was intended to show the glittering water and sun’s reflection.</p>
<p>The<em> Spider </em>sculpture in front is entitled “Maman” by Louise Bourgeois. It means mother in French and was designed to show vulnerability, lightness, negative space.</p>
<p>The architect wanted to remove historical references. Most museums were done in variants of Neoclassicism – stone structures with pedimented fronts, colonnades, lofty and rational spaces.</p>
<p>The layout was an arrangement to focus on a central atrium with the 165-foot entrance.  This serves as a circulation hub and orientation gallery, providing access to the other 20 galleries on three levels.</p>
<p>The exhibition spaces have surprising shapes and does not follow the white cube method. Instead, it uses angled or curving walls and balconies. It is a complex and somewhat chaotic interior, with twisting glass-and-steel walls. It does not follow traditional Neoclassical design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The building was very well received and the benefit to local economy was immediate and substantial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> was part of an ambitious urban renewal program to help the aging port and industrial city that had experienced significant decline in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Geographically, the location provided cheap land for a major museum, as opposed to a thriving European or American city. <strong>Deconstructivism’s fragmented forms</strong> represented uncertainty of contemporary life, like the downfall of Soviet Union the Berlin Wall and the 1987 stock market.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 10.4 Theories and Interpretations of Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>The study of art history is shaped by different theories and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated, and adapted to make an art historical argument about a work or a group of works of art. Intended meanings are often open-ended and subject to multiple interpretations.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> San Francisco MOMA</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> by<strong> Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>was a<strong> mixed-media installation </strong>that was placed in<strong> New York City, US and spanned 23 miles long </strong>as a work of<strong> site-specific art. </strong></p>
<p>The installation was comprised of<strong> 7,503 gates across footpaths in Central Park</strong>. Each <strong>16-foot-tall gate</strong> had a piece of <strong>saffron colored fabric</strong> hanging to 7 feet above ground level. The widths of the gates matched the widths of the walkways. Gates were set down to avoid drilling.  The structures formed an oval path that intersected. There was no start or ending points.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1786" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1786" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1786" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-B-The-Gates.jpg?resize=900%2C337&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="900" height="337" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-B-The-Gates.jpg?w=417&amp;ssl=1 417w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-B-The-Gates.jpg?resize=300%2C112&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1786" class="wp-caption-text">The Gates<br />© Panoramic Images/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> introduced eye-catching color into the landscape and infused light into a winter scene. Orange contrasted with brown and gave off the “spring is coming” vibe.</p>
<p>The work was temporary with all materials intended for recycling or sale.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The installation was free to the public. The artists wanted to alter the experience of walking in the park to be an original, temporary experience. A golden ceiling creating warm shadows for visitors, as well as a refuge from city life. It encouraged people to go outdoors. It made people look and drew attention to the landscape.</p>
<p>In aerial view. <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> looked like a golden river that appeared and disappeared among the trees in the park.</p>
<p>How does art respond to and impact our relationship with the built environment? What is natural? What is “constructed”?</p>
<p>This work helped to move visitors from being unaware of their surroundings to aware and engaged.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Gates</strong> was only exhibited from February 12<sup>th</sup> – February 27<sup>th</sup>, 2005, in Central Park.</p>
<p>The fabric moved organically with the wind. Light moved through it mirroring the visitors’ movement underneath it.</p>
<p>The installation was inspired by Japanese Shinto tradition of torii (gates) that mark the transition at shrines from the secular to the sacred.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The husband-and-wife artist team of  <strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>developed the concept for the art installation in 1979. It was not produced until 2005. For this reason, we can consider it as linked to environmental/site-specific art of the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> cost $21 million. The artist financed the project themselves. There were no sponsors, instead they self-fund every project and sold merchandise related to the exhibition. Part of the costs of the work were wages for 600 workers to install it. The team also paid for security guards at night.</p>
<p>The artists had to submit proposals, attend meetings, and make presentations to  both the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy administration. In 1982, they received a 251-page rejection.</p>
<p>The election of Michael Bloomberg, in 2001, who was a fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, was the turning point.</p>
<p>Central Park was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was meant as a city refuge. It recalled ideas of the Victorian pastoral and picturesque.</p>
<p>People criticized <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> for interfering with man’s relationship with nature. But the irony is that Central Park itself was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as a city refuge.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Crossing</em></strong> by<strong> Bill Viola </strong>is a<strong> video/sound </strong>installation that uses a double-sided screen on a freestanding piece of clear acrylic. It was shot using high-speed film that achieved 300 frames per second in great detail. Viola reduced the speed of the playback to extremely slow motion. This enhances the drama. Sound amplifies the experience.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist wanted to create an immersive sound and video environment to dwell on transformation and change as well as growth and decay. These are inevitable processes.</p>
<p>Slow-motion is not just a technological choice. It is meant to invite a meditative and contemplative response. One that requires the viewer to concentrate for longer and slows us down. This increases our awareness of movement, detail, and change. This creates a connection between the artistic and spiritual experience. We could interpret it in a religious way, even though the work makes no direct iconographic or religious overtones.</p>

<p>There are two different video sequences that are simultaneously shown.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water + fire = duality</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>water video </strong>the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A trickle of water overhead appears until he disappears in a deluge. As the water ceases, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>In the <strong>fire video</strong> the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A flame starts at his feet and spreads over his legs and torso until he disappears in flames. As the fire dies down, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>This draws on universal truths about life and death from Eastern/Western traditions. Fire/water is a barrier between this world and the next. Humans struggle to survive both of these in disasters.</p>
<p><strong>Flames</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shiva Nataraja</li>
<li>Parliament</li>
<li>Chartres Cathedral (destruction, rebirth)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Biblical flood by Michelangelo</li>
<li>Great Wave</li>
<li>Basin</li>
<li>Slave Ship (destruction, cleansing)</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements  <strong>often symbolize change, redemption, transformation, and renewal.</strong></p>
<p>The act of self-annihilation in the figure’s disappearance serves as a metaphor for destruction of the ego.</p>
<p>The title <strong><em>The Crossing </em></strong>is in references to the crossing of an individual to a different state of being.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Describes a childhood experience of almost drowning as “beautiful” and “without fear”.</li>
<li>Viola is a devoted Zen Buddhist.</li>
<li>In college, he majored in religious studies, psychology, and electrical engineering&#8211; all clearly visible here.</li>
<li>Inspired by Nam June Paik, an early innovator in the field of video art.</li>
<li>Even though the art object has greatly changed, the themes of life, death, religion, redemption continue.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 10.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>In the scholarly realm, as well as in mainstream media, <strong>contemporary</strong> art is now a major phenomenon experienced and understood in a global context. Art history surveys have traditionally offered less attention to <strong>art made from 1980 to the present</strong>. Although such surveys often presented contemporary art as largely a European and American phenomenon, today, contemporary art produced by artists of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the First Nations is receiving the same, if not more attention.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First, <strong>the waning of colonialism</strong>, inaugurated by independence movements. Then there have been <strong>shifts in the balance of power</strong>. Think the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the rise of China. Additionally, the <strong>development of widespread communication</strong> <strong>networks</strong> such as the internet have all contributed. Contemporary art now represents a world that is global and interconnected rather than Eurocentric.</p>
<p>The art world has expanded and <strong>become more inclusive</strong> since the 1960s, as artists of all nationalities, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations have challenged the traditional privileged place of white, heterosexual men in art history. This activism has been supported by theories (e.g., deconstructionist, feminist, poststructuralist, and queer) that critique perspectives on history and culture that claim universality but are in fact exclusionary.</p>

<p><strong>Museum: </strong>MOMA</p>
<p><strong><em>Pink Panther</em></strong> by American artist<strong> Jeff Koons </strong>is a work using<strong> glazed porcelain </strong>that stands<strong> 3 feet by 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>The work was made in triplicate commercial production. It is highly polished and gleaming. The glossy texture makes it look factory-made, associated with cheap figurines. <strong>Kitsch,</strong> a word of German origin, refers to mass-produced imagery designed to please everyone.</p>
<p>The colors are garish and bright. Think toothpaste minty colors with yellow hair and bubblegum pink. Deliberately gaudy colors were common in kitsch/knickknacks/souvenirs. These were Inspired by German figurines.</p>
<p>Koons had a German workshop where making these figurines was a long-standing tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Pink Panther</em></strong> From a series called “Banality” created with the condition of being unoriginal, dull, stale, boring. The series consisted of 20 sculptures in porcelain and polychromed wood. There appeared to be nothing serious about any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Koons</strong> was doing what Duchamp did.</p>
<p><strong>How far could he take the definition of art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>This gave viewers a number of challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Challenged taste (high class/fine art) (tacky vs. classy).</li>
<li>Challenged originality (stole another’s image).</li>
<li>Challenged uniqueness of the individual art object (made 3 of them).</li>
<li>Challenged construction (didn’t make it himself).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Drew from pop culture to create a sculpture that comments on art and beauty as commodities.</li>
<li>Is a simple (or even tacky) appropriation of other people’s images made by other people art?
<ul>
<li>He is a critic of mass culture, and he reveals this by utilizing mass culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Capitalize on the recognizable to sell art.</li>
<li>“Marriage of pop culture and art-world elitism”.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pink Panther</strong> is a cartoon character from film/TV series in the 1960s/70s. The woman in the sculpture is</p>
<p><strong>Jayne Mansfield</strong> a 1960s B-list Hollywood star (and real-life mother of actress Mariska Hargitay who plays Olivia on Law &amp; Order: SVU!) Mansfield was a buxom platinum blond, known for wardrobe malfunctions.</p>
<p>Pink Panther is in an erotic pose with Mansfield, who is smiling, bare-breasted, and tilting her head back as if to smile at a crowd of onlookers. Her right hand covers her exposed breast. Pink Panther’s tail is tucking into the back of her dress.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This work was sold in 2014 to MOMA for $16,800,000. <strong>Koons</strong> was Gauguin-like in his intentional self-promotion. He took out ads in major art magazines and employed a PR/image consultant.</p>
<p>Accused of breaking copyright laws, <strong>Koons</strong> claimed fair use by parody. He was sued for copyright infringement and settled out of court.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong>  The expansion of art object/artist that challenges tradition. Appropriation is key.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trade (Gifts for Trading Land with White People) </em></strong>by artist <strong>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith </strong>is an artwork of<strong> oil and mixed media on canvas </strong>that measures<strong> 5 by 14 feet.   It is </strong>divided into three panels or a <strong>triptych</strong>.</p>
<p>Is this a painting? A collage? An installation? Is it all three?</p>
<p>This is what is known as an <strong>assemblage</strong>. This means bringing together a variety of media to make something 3D. It was inspired by AbEx painters with their energetic application of abstract brushstrokes.</p>
<p>This work <strong>uses white, yellow, green, and red paint.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Made as a response to the 500<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Columbus’s landing in the New World</strong></li>
<li>Part of a series called the <strong>Quincentenary Non-Celebration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Untold history of Native Americans</strong> being poorly compensated for their tribal lands</li>
<li>Smith offers up these cheap trinkets in exchange for the lands that were lost, reversing the historic sale of land for trinkets.</li>
<li>Smith said: “If the work could speak, it would say <em>Why won’t you white people consider trading the land we handed over to you for these silly trinkets? Sound like a bad deal? Well, that’s the deal you gave us.”</em></li>
<li>Native life has been commoditized, turning Native cultural objects into cheap items or logos or children’s toys without true understanding of what the intention originally was.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Covered with tribal newspaper articles about native life combined with images of stereotypical Native Americans from product designs and advertisements.</li>
<li>Newspaper articles about Natives, photos, comics, tobacco and gum wrappers, fruit carton labels, ads, pages from comic books, images of deer, buffalo, and Native men holding pipes in their hands.</li>
<li>Outline of a canoe has been painted: traditional form of native transportation (suggests possibility of trade) but canoe is stuck, there is no water.
<ul>
<li>Red in particular: referred to Native heritage, blood, warfare, anger, sacrifice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Above, a string lined with inexpensive toys that imitate traditional Native culture: toy tomahawks, a child’s headdress with brightly colored feathers, Red Man chewing tobacco, Washington Redskins cap and license plate, Florida State Seminoles bumper sticker, Cleveland Indians pennant and hat, Atlanta Braves license plate, beaded belt, toy quiver with arrows, plastic Indian doll.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artist is Native American</strong> and uses her cultural heritage with traditional art to make new media.</li>
<li>Her first name <strong>Jaune</strong> is the French word for yellow and a reference to her French-Cree heritage.</li>
<li>Her middle name <strong>Quick-to-see</strong> was given by her grandmother, who commented on her perception.</li>
<li>Received a BA in art education instead of studio because her instructors told her no woman could have a career as an artist, even though they acknowledged she had been better than all the men in the classes.</li>
<li><strong>Questions contemporary inequities</strong> that exist and that are rooted in colonial experiences.</li>
<li>References the role of trade goods in stories like the acquisition of Manhattan by Dutch colonists in 1626 for $24. Although the story is probably not true, it speaks to the idea that Native Americans were commonly lured off their land by what were in fact inexpensive trade goods.  They did not have the same understanding of private property as Europeans did. Remember Bandolier bag!</li>
<li><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> Art in a global context, with an expansion of art object/artist and social critique.</li>

<p><strong><em>Rebellious Silence</em></strong><strong>, from the Women of Allah series </strong>by<strong> Shirin Neshat (artist) </strong>and<strong> photo by Cynthia Preston </strong>is a work of<strong> ink on paper. </strong>The work is formally striking with hard edges of black color against a bright white background.</p>
<p>The portrait is bisected along a vertical seam created by the barrel of the rifle. The woman’s eyes stare at us from both sides of the divide.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>honors female revolutionaries</strong> on both sides in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It examines the complexities of <strong>women’s identities</strong> in the Middle East. <strong><em>Women of Allah series</em></strong> has allowed for a more complicated image of Middle Eastern women, and challenges the simplistic and stereotypical Islamic woman that the media has shown us.</p>
<p><strong>Duality between:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tradition/modernity</li>
<li>East/West</li>
<li>Beauty/violence</li>
<li>Sexuality/propriety</li>
<li>Freedom/oppression</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The artwork portrays female warriors of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in series called “Women of Allah”. It addresses <strong>four symbols that Westerners associate with the Muslim world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text </strong>covers part of her face that is usually covered by a niqab (traditional Muslim face scarf). The poetry is written by Iranian women about the revolution (Tahereh Saffarzadeh’s poem called <em>Allegiance with Wakefulness</em>).</p>
<p>Persian poetry is a rich tradition in Islam – Westerners do not know this history. Western viewers who do not read it will still understand the importance of Islamic script.</p>
<p>Post-1979 Iranian Revolution, all Muslim women were required to wear a <strong>veil</strong> in public.  Many Muslims found the practice empowering and affirmative of their religious identities, even though in the West we interpret this as oppressive.</p>
<p>The <strong>gun</strong> represents control and violence, but also religious martyrdom. We assume gun must mean violence right away. Westerners associate violence with jihad, although this is not the case. The rifle references the deliberate arming of Muslim women during the revolution.</p>
<p>Look at the <strong>woman’s gaze</strong>. Notice that in this image <strong>she STARES BACK</strong>.  Westerners assume she would/should be modest  and that she has been conditioned to be this way. Here she is retaking her body and freeing it from objectification</p>
<h5><strong>Iran in Context</strong></h5>
<p>Iran had been ruled by Shah (king) Pahlavi from 1941 – 1979. He was known for violent repression of Islamic religious freedom. Yet he FAVORED westernization. Iran was ally of both Britain and the US.  Women’s rights were promoted.</p>
<p>The 1979 Iranian Revolution was led by Ayatollah Khomeini. A very strict and conservative religious government dismantled Westernization.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Shirin Neshat </strong>was born in Iran in 1957 and raised in Westernization. She attended Catholic school to learn Western and Islamic history. Later, in the mid-1970s, she left Iran, moving to California, as attitudes towards the West grew increasingly hostile. She could not show her work in modern Iran as it was too dangerous.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What makes this Postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>This is an example of art in a global context, with an expansion of art object/artist, as well as social critique.</p>

<p><strong>Museum :</strong> Museum de Arte de Puerto Rico</p>
<p><strong><em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop)</em></strong> by artist<strong> Pepon Osorio</strong> is a mixed-media installation. This large-scale work is immersive and visually opulent. It has been dubbed Nuyorican Baroque in reference to the opulence of New Spanish Baroque. It is meant to be entered and experienced by the viewer.</p>
<p>This work re-creates the artist’s memory of his first haircut at age 5, where he was told not to cry like a girl. He wanted to capture the limiting gender expectations of being male. There were only two options&#8211;being macho or being gay. The work challenge to the strong sense of machismo and homophobia in Latino communities. This is also a celebration of Nuyorican culture while at the same time offering a critique of it.</p>
<p>“Shop” <strong>contains images of Latino men</strong>, some crying and being bullied, and some men acting strong. There are powders that enhance male sexual performance and products for penile enhancement.</p>
<p>It is packed with <strong>masculine symbols</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>barber chairs</li>
<li>sports paraphernalia</li>
<li>depictions of sperm and circumcision</li>
<li>phallic symbols</li>
<li>tattoos</li>
<li>male action heroes</li>
<li>Puerto Rican flags</li>
<li>Baseballs</li>
<li>Framed portraits of famous Latino men.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also included videos playing interviews of Latino elder men from a retirement home nearby being asked about the idea of machismo and pro-traditionally defined masculinity.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pepon Osorio</strong> is a Puerto Rican born artist who was a social worker in the Bronx. He was not trained as an artist. He had a first-hand view of youth culture and the social expectations of his community. He lived in the Nuyorican Community (Puerto Ricans living in New York City) who have a distinct sense of cultural pride. Machoism is a central tenet of gender identity in this community.</p>
<p>The work was created in collaboration with local residents. They even <strong>offered haircuts to viewers in the opening art show.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object/artist and a social critique.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000)</em></strong> by Samoan artist<strong> Michel Tuffery, </strong>from New Zealand<strong>. </strong>It is a<strong> mixed media work </strong>made with<strong> found objects</strong> assembled and <strong>appropriated</strong> into <strong>sculpture in the round. </strong>It is made from flattened corned-beef tins joined by rivets. Notice how the coloration of the tins affects where it is placed, such as hooves, bodies or faces to provide contrast.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The work argues that foreign intervention and imperialism creates dependency. It teaches us about the impact of colonial economies in Pacific Island culture.</p>
<p>Imported commodities became integral parts of Polynesian customs of feasting and gift-giving. This replaced the tradition of tapa cloth. Due to the presence of Europeans harvesting and slaughtering techniques, also changed.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000)</em></strong> was named for the local Samoan term for canned goods. The term is derived from the Samoan version of “pea soup” which is <strong>pisupo. </strong>Pea soup was one of the first canned foods to be introduced by Europeans. Pisupo later meant “canned food” as a broad term.</p>
<p>A life-size bull is made from flattened cans of corned beef <strong>symbolizing that animals are just products to be sold</strong>. Using the title with 2000 in it makes us think about a modern, mass-produced commodity like a vacuum.</p>
<h5><strong>Changes Through Western Influence</strong></h5>
<p>The presence of Europeans/Westerners changed two things:</p>
<p><strong>Gift -giving</strong> typically included tapa cloth and Fijian mats, like in the Processional for Queen Elizabeth II.  Later Canned foods quickly became prestigious items used as ceremonial gifts in Samoa. Pisupo (canned foods) quickly replaced traditional indigenous foods and caused native practices to die out.</p>
<p><strong>Farming</strong> (harvesting/slaughtering) practices changed completely to be replaced by imported canned food.</p>
<h5><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>This is art in a global context with  and expansion of art object/artist, along with a social critique.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Centre Pompidou</p>
<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf</em></strong> by <strong>Kiki Smith </strong>is a work of<strong> ink and pencil on paper. The paper on this large-scale work </strong>does not have a nice finish and is left wrinkled. This is really just a sketch!</p>
<p>The negative space is great and undefined. There is no horizon line. The reclining nude contains little to no modelling.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work is <strong>a feminist approach and retelling of popular folktales</strong>. The associations with Woman and Nature mean that the woman is not the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Why are women in fairy tales always in danger or near death?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Snow White</li>
<li>Sleeping Beauty</li>
<li>Ariel</li>
<li>Cinderella</li>
<li>Little Red Riding Hood</li>
<li>Belle</li>
</ul>
<p>Women have been associated with nature. Why does this imply women wouldn’t understand it? A deeper connection?</p>
<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf </em></strong> references the tradition of the reclining female nude but transforms it. The work is  not sexualized. She doesn’t stare out but reclines with animal. The audience doesn’t matter, she pays them no mind.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>A reclining female nude lays intimately with a wolf. This is not about bestiality, however, but it is an act of bonding between humans (especially women) and nature. The wolf nuzzles her affectionately, much like she cuddles with a dog. She strokes his fur.</p>
<p>The woman has tamed the wolf’s wildness. Neither is a victim any longer. This is symbiotic.</p>
<p>Both figures seem to nurture one another. They are not stereotypically predator and prey. It’s hard to pick who would have been the prey anyway. Is it the woman because she is vulnerable? Is it the animal to show man’s power over nature?</p>
<h5><strong>References</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Little Red Riding Hood</em></strong> is a story that is normally quite violent and is now rendered sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Saint Genevieve</strong> the patron saint of Paris is associated with animals and her ability to domesticate wolves.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kiki Smith</strong> was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1954. She grew up, as part of an artistic family in an old Victorian house in New Jersey. It captured her imagination and inspired her to think of fairy tales and the feminist retellings. Her common subjects include fairy tales, women, animals, and Victorian literature.</p>
<h5><strong>What makes this postmodern? </strong></h5>
<p>Appropriation is key. There is an expansion of art object/artist and a social critique, as well as a revival of tradition.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong> is a<strong> mixed-media installation </strong>work by artist<strong> Yinka Shonibare </strong>measuring<strong> 10 feet tall. </strong>This is a 3D sculpture/ installation of a life-size headless female mannequin, installed in a corner of the gallery with foliage.  It is based on the iconic Rococo 1767 painting by Fragonard, <strong><em>The Swing. </em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a sculpture that is both familiar and strange to us. It <strong>draws our attention</strong> to the prominence of <strong>racism.</strong></p>
<p>It is jarring at first to see a black woman replace one of the most coquettish, erotic, and delicate women in the history of art. Why? We are not used to seeing black women in art as the main subject and especially in a glamorized and eroticized way.</p>
<p>As we participate in the voyeurism, we become like the man in the bush in <strong><em>The Swing.</em> </strong></p>
<p>This <strong>shows the multi-cultural, multi-racial world that we live in</strong>. The Identity is not singular, rather it is cross-cultural or multi-cultural. In this work we have a European painting and a black woman wearing Dutch wax (African fabric).</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Like Fragonard’s, <em>The Swing</em>, <strong>this work</strong> <strong>retains a woman on swing, a shoe mid-flight, and the foliage. </strong>What has been <strong>excluded are the men, much of the garden, the race of woman, the head and identical clothing.</strong></p>
<p>The woman is <strong>dressed in a traditional French Rococo style, but it is made with African fabric (called Dutch wax)</strong>. This is different from the decorative and frilly opulence in the original.</p>
<p><strong>The woman has no head</strong>. This may refer to the fate that awaited many Rococo aristocrats in the French Revolution&#8212; the guillotine!  <em>The Swing</em> was seen as the epitome of excess and extravagance in the Rococo.</p>
<p>The woman is black rather than white. There is a <strong>juxtaposition</strong> of something that is European with what is African.</p>
<h5><strong>What Makes this Postmodern? </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong> allows us to understand art in a global context. It has an expansion of art object/artist, as well as a social critique. Appropriations are common to show challenges to tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Not Originally African</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Dutch Wax</strong> fabrics were made in the Southeast Asian Dutch/English colonies. These quickly became even cheaper to produce in African colonies. Production was moved there. Eventually, the bright patterning became distinctive and integrated into African clothing and used in African nationalist movements.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Yinka Shonibare </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">is a British-bo</span><strong>t the Artist</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">rn Nigerian who is sensitive to nationalism, identity, and race. Paralyzed on half of his body, he directs his artwork production to his studio.</span></p>
<p>The artist referred to himself as a hybrid. As an art student in London, his teacher told him to make work that expressed his African identity. This prompted him to think about stereotypes and the difficulties that exist for those who are multiracial.</p>

<p><strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> by artist<strong> El Anatsui </strong>is an art object made with<strong> aluminum and copper wire </strong>standing<strong> 16 feet tall. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>What is it? </strong></h5>
<p>A sculpture in 3D?  A painting to hang on the wall?  An installation?  Is it fine art or craft? Fabric? Post-Modernism purposefully disregards the limited categories imposed by Western art history.</p>
<p>This work is <strong>made from old liquor metal bottle caps</strong> and labels (<strong>modular)</strong>. ALL were found in  the Ghana bush (<strong>found object</strong>). The artist was careful to create <strong>bands of black, silver, gold, and red</strong>. These were fastened together with <strong>copper wire.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Construction</strong></h5>
<p>El Anatsui works in a warehouse. His assistants piece it together under his direction.</p>
<p>The artist <strong>never gives museums any hanging instructions</strong>.  The piece is always different when it is hung. <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> catches the light from every angle and creates a reflective surface.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bottle caps</strong> signify a fraught <strong>history of trade between Europe and Africa. </strong>European liquor was a major element of the transatlantic slave trade/Triangle Trade.</p>
<p><strong>Alcoholism</strong> is a significant problem in African communities. Just like <strong>Corned Beef 2000</strong>, globalization, and an introduction of Western goods into non-western regions has created both an imbalance and a dependency.</p>
<p>Anatsui’s cloths cause us to examine our conceptions of waste – appropriation/recycling of waste.</p>
<p>The title, <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> refers to the significance of textiles in African societies.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Part of a series called <strong>Gawu</strong> (the Ghanian word for metal cloth)</li>
<li>Pattern is based on <strong>kente cloth</strong> – traditional fabric in Ghana</li>
<li><strong>Gold colors</strong> also recall the colonial past of Ghana (previously called the Gold Coast by the British) until its independence in 1957.</li>
<li>The fluid movement of the work reminds the viewer of the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, which carried slave ships and trade ships from Africa to the New World.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>El Anatsui</strong> was born in Ghana in 1944. He trained in an academic European-style academy. In 1964, when he was beginning art school, many parts of Africa were pushing for independence and decolonization. He joined the <strong>Sankofa</strong> movement which worked to unearth and reclaim Africa’s rich artistic tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Men in Ghana weave fabrics</strong>. This is highly unusual because globally, this tends to be a women’s tradition.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> Expansion of artist/art object, the revival of tradition and social critique.</p>
<p>The Met owns two of Anatsui’s metal wall hangings, but two separate departments purchased them: Arts of Africa and Modern/Contemporary Art. Which one is more appropriate and why?</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Brooklyn Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong> by Kenyan artist<strong> Wangechi Mutu </strong>is an artwork created by using<strong> mixed media on mylar.  </strong>Here she used collage incorporating fragments from fashion magazines, specially colored paper and more.  This was applied to mylar, which is a soft reflective piece of plastic. (Balloons are made of mylar.)</p>
<p>The work has drips of white ink on top of colors. This is reminiscent of stars and constellations, with the connection of human form to the universe.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This takes the attitudes of gender, sexuality, and the female nude and complicates them. We are used to docile, sexual, attractive white women. This woman seems powerful, engaged, confident, and not white.</p>
<p>There is a twist on the tradition of female nudes. It takes a woman who is passive and makes her active.  She is now preying on and ensnaring men.</p>
<p>When we view her, we assume she is not white. Why? How can we tell what race she is at all ? If we assume she isn’t white, we subject her to not only sexism but racism as well.</p>
<h5><strong>What’s in a Title?</strong></h5>
<p>The title <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong> reminds the viewer of a praying mantis, when looking at the female’s bent legs.  <strong>Praying mantises</strong> camouflage themselves, then snare prey with their enormous legs. During mating, a female praying mantis becomes a sexual cannibal.</p>
<p>Is the subject our prey? We prey on her by gazing on her, but she seems powerful, strong,  and confident. Is this a message about men falling prey to sexual women? She ensnares men, like her insect counterpart.</p>
<h5><strong>Juxtapositions</strong></h5>
<p>The woman is full of <strong>juxtapositions,</strong> and a hybrid-like figure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexualized yet legs tightly crossed</li>
<li>Human yet not human-like (more of a creature)</li>
<li>Relaxed yet exposed</li>
<li>Physical yet flayed</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Skinless</strong></h5>
<p>The inner flesh is on the outside of her body. Removing her skin removes the idea of race. Then, the viewer can just focus on the woman, regardless of race or identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>blanket</strong> represents <strong>kuba cloth</strong>, a Kenyan style of cloth.</p>
<p>The <strong>tree</strong> reminds us of creation myths. It also connects women to nature. Her left hand holds a <strong>small green serpent</strong> which links this woman with Eve. It joins her to Western tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Artist Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Artist <strong>Wangechi Mutu</strong> was born in Nairobi, Kenya but educated in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>She spoke about how one of the effects of colonialism in Africa was to introduce European or white narratives to African history and visual arts. This had the negative effect of Africans viewing their own art through a European lens.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is this Postmodern?</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em> </strong>there is appropriation, change of tradition and an expansion of  the artist.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 10.2 Purpose and Audience in Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p>Diverse art forms are considered according to perceived similarities in form, content, and artistic intent over broad themes. This includes existential investigations and socio-political critiques, as well as reflections on the natural world, art’s history, popular and traditional cultures, and technological innovation<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The iconic building becomes a sought-after trademark for cities. Computer-aided design affects the diversity of innovative architectural forms, which tend toward the aspirational and the visionary. The worldwide proliferation of contemporary art museums, galleries, biennials and triennials, exhibitions, and print and digital publications has created numerous, diverse venues for the presentation and evaluation of art in today’s world.</p>
<p>Artists frequently use appropriation and “mash-ups” to devalue or revalue culturally sacred objects, and to negate or support expectations of artworks based on regional, cultural, and chronological associations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em></strong><em> by </em><strong>Maya Lin</strong> is comprised of <strong>granite</strong> and stands in <strong>Washington D.C., US</strong>. <strong>Each arm is 246 feet by 9 inches long. </strong></p>
<p>This work is a highly reflective <strong>black granite</strong> formed into a <strong>V-shaped wall</strong>.  It is <strong>sunk into the land</strong> rather than set on top of it. The two walls point towards either the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument. Where the walls meet, they are 10.1 feet high. Each wall slopes at the ends to less than a foot and is covered with <strong>text only</strong>. There are <strong>no images</strong>.</p>
<p>The work was inspired by <strong>Minimalism</strong>. This art movement that begins in the 1960s in the US, aims to eliminate all non-essentials in an artwork by reducing it to its most simple geometric elements. It goes further than Cubism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Lin had to create a way to <strong>commemorate loss</strong> without designing a memorial that would tell people what to think about Vietnam. It needed to be approachable and apolitical, with a focus on work being a place of mourning and healing.</p>
<p>The design does not aim to resolve conflicting emotions about the validity of the war. Instead, it is meant to be a space for catharsis, mourning and contemplation.</p>
<p>The viewer must engage with the work close up to interact with it. The reflection of the loved one’s name is a powerful reminder of their sacrifice for the country.</p>
<p>The <strong>sunken placement</strong> was meant to evoke <strong>a spiritual journey</strong> for the viewer. They enter and sink deeper to reflect on the death of the soldiers. The living are carrying on the memory.  It also signifies a deep cut in the earth that will heal over time, but <strong>there will always be a scar.</strong></p>
<p>The wall was intentionally made reflective and shiny. The names of the dead literally comprise our bodies’ reflection. The message is we are here because of their sacrifice.  While we see reflections, they are not as clear as a mirror.  It is as if we are gazing into a ghostly realm.</p>

<p><em>Thus, the war’s beginning and end meet; the war is ‘complete,’ coming full circle yet broken by the earth that bounds the angle’s open side and continued with the earth itself.</em></p>
<p>The work was intentionally shaped like a book. Visitors read names from left to right. <strong>There are 72 panels containing 58,286 names.</strong> These names are listed in order of when the men and women died or were declared missing. There have been periodic additions.</p>
<p>The growth of the structure <strong>perfectly parallels the number of deaths</strong>, almost like a timeline. The lowest number of deaths are shown at the beginning and end, with the greatest number in the middle.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial </em></strong><em>was </em>designed by a 21-year-old Yale University junior named <strong>Maya Lin</strong>, in 1981. She was still a student at Yale’s School of Architecture. The work was made for a public design competition. Her professor had assigned this as a project for his students. (Meanwhile, she only received a B+ grade on it from the professor!)</p>
<p>Her design was one of over 2,573 submissions, in response to a call for entries by the US government.</p>
<p>The idea came from the Yale Memorial Rotunda. Alumni who had been killed in war have their names inscribed on the walls. She used to touch the names and feel contemplative.</p>
<p>She did not do any specific research on the war because she felt politics had eclipsed the veterans. She wanted the focus to remain on the deceased.</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was a disaster on all counts. Most Americans believed the war was a moral tragedy. All of America knew it had been lost. Most opposed to the war did not blame the soldiers but the government, although some did attack soldiers or disrespect them upon their return. The vets were angry with the lack of respect and distraught about the great loss.</p>
<p>The average age of names on the wall is 19.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for a US soldier upon putting their boots on the ground in Vietnam was 1 month.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Vast Criticism</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Lin was resoundingly <strong>criticized for this work.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>black color </strong>was said to not match with the rest of the US Mall. It was called “black gash on Mall”.</p>
<p>People interpreted the color black as a symbol of shame and dishonor over the war. Lin meant it as a sign of mourning. Additionally, black was seen as a color in Asian art, and was not typical in American, Western, or classical art&#8211;that color would have been white.</p>
<p>The work was considered <strong>nonrepresentational and not traditional</strong>.  It lacked ornamentation and did not follow traditional funerary sculpture. Many thought the design was too simple and did not depict honor and sacrifice in a traditional way.</p>
<p>War veterans wanted a traditional and realistic sculpture. One is added off to the side to assuage concerns.</p>
<p>People wondered why a young Asian American woman from an Ivy League college who did not know the realities of war was the artist. Why would she be picked to design a monument about deaths in an Asian war?</p>
<p>Building permits were refused. It took a 4 Star Brigadier General to testify before subcommittee hearings and defend the color before the project moved forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maya Lin</strong><em> said, “It took me 9 months to ask the VVMF, in charge of building the memorial, if my race was an issue. It had never occurred to me that it would be, and I think they had taken all the measures they could to shield me from comments about a “gook” designing the memorial. I remember reading the article that appeared in The Washington Post referring to “An Asian Memorial for an Asian War” and I knew we were in trouble.” </em><em> </em></p>
<p>She continued by saying<em>, “The controversy exploded in Washington after that. Ironically, one side attacked the design for being “too Asian,” while others saw its simplicity and understatement, not as an intention to create a more Eastern, meditative space, but as a minimalist statement which they interpreted as being non-referential and disconnected from human experience. This left the opinion in many that the piece emanated from a series of intellectualized aesthetic decisions, which automatically pitted artist against veterans. The fact that I was from an Ivy League college and had hair down to my knees further fueled this distrust of the design and suspicions of a hippie college liberal or aesthetic elitist forcing her art and commentary upon them.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> British Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Summer Trees</em></strong> by <strong>Song Su-nam</strong> is an <strong>ink on paper</strong> artwork that measures <strong>2 feet tall</strong>. It uses broad, vertical, and elongated parallel brush strokes of ink. The strokes blend, overlapping and bleeding with one another using a monochromatic palette of velvety blacks and grays.</p>
<p>Blurry, feathery edges reveal pale washes applied to wet paper. The crisper lines are ones that were applied to dry paper. Formal simplicity and abstraction of <strong>Abstract Expressionists</strong> combined with <strong>subtle tonal variation of Asian ink paintings</strong> are combined in this work.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Song felt that materials and styles of the West, though popular in Korea, did not express his identity.</p>
<p>So, he blended the two together.</p>
<p><strong>Korean</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>medium of ink</li>
<li>paper</li>
<li>subject</li>
<li>symbolism</li>
<li>blacks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>West</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>style</li>
<li>abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>This was part of a movement called <strong>Sumukwha</strong> to recover a national identity through art. This work has allusions to scholars and friendship. It could be Song’s statement of optimism in the rediscovery of traditional values through this group.</p>
<p>It references the tradition of <strong>literati (scholar-artist)</strong>. Song was considered a <strong>modern literati</strong>. Even though we spoke of literati with <em>Travels Among Mountains and Streams</em>, remember <strong>sinification</strong> brought Chinese culture to Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The title <strong><em>Summer Trees</em></strong> refers to the natural world and the highly stylized trees with thick foliage and trunks. In Korean and Chinese tradition, <strong>a group of pine trees</strong> can symbolize a gathering of honorable friends, or friends who are wise and intellectual.</p>
<p>Mountainous landscapes and plants serve as metaphors for the ideal qualities of literati:</p>
<ul>
<li>loyalty</li>
<li>intelligence</li>
<li>strength</li>
<li>honor</li>
</ul>
<p>Literati lived lives connected to nature and away from the chaos of urban life.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Song Su-nam</strong> was a leader of the <strong>Sumukhwa movement</strong> of the 1980s. Sumukhwa was a movement to recover national identity through reviving traditional Korean art as Western modernism/abstraction was becoming increasingly popular across Korea. It is a Korean term for ink wash painting aka literati painting.</p>
<p><strong>Why was Westernization growing? </strong>After the Korean War, a growing American presence in South Korea brought with it an increase of Westernization. Many were concerned that traditional Korean culture was disappearing.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong>  This is art in a global context, and an expansion of art object/artist. It is a social critique.</p>

<li>Installation environment with open books across the floor, handscrolls suspended overhead, and panels along the walls.</li>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The <strong>audience is united</strong> by their illiteracy. We end up searching for what does not exist – an understanding of this text and history.</p>
<p>The work <strong>upholds the ancient Daoist belief</strong> that the deepest truths can never be captured by words alone. <strong>This is a critique</strong> of the meaninglessness of contemporary political language and as a commentary on the illegibility of the past.</p>
<p><strong>It draws attention</strong> to the erasing of history under Mao’s Communist regime. In this way, people cannot learn about the history of China, as we cannot read these texts. It represents a loss of meaning and culture.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>In ancient Chinese art, <strong>squares symbolized earth</strong>. Look at how the books are arranged on the ground, and long swoops and curves indicate Heaven. Look how the scrolls are arranged overhead.</p>
<p><strong>“Sky book”</strong> in Chinese means something that is incomprehensible. It’s an inspiration from the title.</p>
<p>Also, it is an allusion to the texts suspended overhead.</p>
<p>There are 4,000 characters created to appear to be real but are unreadable and meaningless. They are meant to mimic traditional Chinese fonts and lettering. Even the way he arranged the texts looks like they are real. Volume 2 is organized like Chinese medical texts, while Volume 3 is like literary texts.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Xu Bing </strong>Grew up surrounded by books in Beijing. His father was a historian, and his mother was a librarian.</p>
<p>During <strong>Mao’s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)</strong>, millions of students/professors were sent to rural villages and work camps. Mao also destroyed Chinese text, art, and histories through the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>In 1975, Xu Bing is separated from his family and forced into agricultural labor at a commune. In 1977, he was able to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing for his bachelors in Printmaking. He trained in social realism and propaganda art. He made his name as a “radical” and “avant-garde” artist.</p>

<p><em>“Chairman Mao’s radical transformation of Chinese culture was most deeply rooted in his transformation of language.

<p><strong><em>Untitled (#228)</em></strong> from the History Portraits series by American artist <strong>Cindy Sherman</strong> is a work of <strong>photography </strong>that measures <strong>6 feet eight inches by 4 feet.</strong></p>
<p>The artwork is <strong>based on a Botticelli painting. </strong>The figure is pushed forward on the picture plane, and it is well-lit. The colors of <strong>red, blue, yellowish gold are prominent</strong>. The upper body is in a triangular composition. The size, lighting, color, and composition are all supposed to be similar to Old Master paintings. The size is equal to a Grand Manner/history painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>From the <strong>“History Portraits”</strong> series – the artist draws inspiration from the history of art. Each work is <strong>based on an Old Master</strong> masterpiece showing her in it. She portrays a feminist hero. Many of her photographs show stereotypes of women or traditionally strong women.</p>
<p>Judith has traditionally been viewed as strong, but alternatively dangerous and sexual.</p>
<p>She <strong>blends aspects of painting with photography</strong>. By creating a photograph modeled after a painting, she becomes a prop even though we assume photography is truthful. We are supposed to realize photography is as much a construct as painting was.</p>
<p>When critiquing the photography, we cannot avoid the fact it can be heavily manipulated. But it also argues for the legitimacy of photography as artistic. If photography can replicate a painting, then photography must have some merits and must be like painting.</p>
<p>This work depicts as reality something that was originally a painting. It presents painting via photography.  Photography cannot be inherently trusted even though this is generally our attitude. (Think magazines and social media).</p>
<p>What Cindy Sherman is really doing is what Daguerre tried to do. That is to illustrate that photography can replicate painting.</p>
<h5><strong>What We See</strong></h5>
<p>This replicates <strong>the story of Judith and Holofernes</strong>. Judith was a heroine in the bible who slayed the Assyrian general, Holofernes. She got him drunk, seduced him, and then beheaded him.</p>
<p>The artist depicts herself in costume, standing in front of textiles in the background This was typical of Baroque art. <strong>Sherman</strong> wears Renaissance-era fashion, consisting of a red-satin dress, with an empire waistline, cinched by a dark blue sash. In her hand is the head (mask) of Holofernes, who is old and wrinkled. In the other hand, she holds a bloody knife.</p>
<p>She stares forward with a blank expression, with a heavily made-up face. Her eyebrows are thin, and her lips are painted red.</p>
<p>Her bare feet point outward and are out of proportion. This might be a reference to early Renaissance difficulties with foreshortening.</p>
<h5><strong>Feminist Art</strong></h5>
<p>Feminist art aims to look back through the canon of art history and draws attention to women through women’s stories, female subjects, and female artists. Popular subjects are the same as during the Renaissance and Baroque period, which were popular stories of strong Biblical women.</p>
<h5><strong>The Book of Judith</strong></h5>
<p>The book of Judith from the Old Testament recounts the story of Judith. To save her people from the Assyrian king, she seduced her way into the tent of the general Holofernes. She then got him drunk and beheaded him. She triumphantly returned with the head to show her people.</p>
<p>The story symbolized triumph over tyranny (much like David and Goliath), and the dangers of femininity.</p>

<p><strong><em>Earth’s Creation</em></strong> by Australian Aboriginal artist<strong> Emily Kame Kngwarreye </strong>is a work of<strong> synthetic polymer paint on canvas </strong>that measures<strong> 20 by 9 feet. </strong></p>
<p>What makes this postmodern?  This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object/artist.</p>
<p>The work is purely abstract and nonrepresentational. There are gestural marks, and each swatch traces the movement of her own hands or brush. She laid the canvas on the ground and sat on it or beside it while she painted.</p>
<p>The work has often been compared to AbEx though she knew nothing about it. It is similar in canvas size, gestural strokes and is an action painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the study of the landscape with the inspiration of colors, seasons, and sensations. The work depicts stories and elements of her cultural heritage. It captures the ways she was influenced by the environment.</p>
<p>The work promotes <strong>sand-painting or dot-painting</strong>, which is an indigenous technique.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Uses the traditional dot-work pattern typical in traditional Aboriginal Australian artwork</li>
<li>All works are influenced by landscapes</li>
<li>This one represents the lushness of “green time” after periods of heavy rain by using tropical blues, yellows, greens, vibrant reds.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Kngwarreye (Ung-WAAR-ay) was an aboriginal artist completely untrained who did not paint until she was 80 years old. It is estimated that she produced over 3,000 paintings during her short eight-year painting career.</p>
<p>She was the first Aboriginal artist whose work broke the million-dollar mark at auction when this was sold in 2007.</p>
<p>Born in 1910, she spent 66 years as a forced laborer on European pastoral estates. When she was “freed,” she began to learn about ceremonial paintings and began working in batiks (dyed cloths) first, as well as ceremonial sand paintings.</p>
<p>One of her works was selected for the cover of an exhibition catalog. Critics lauded the piece and virtually overnight, she achieved acclaim.</p>
<h5><strong>The Culture</strong></h5>
<p>Aboriginal culture is intimately connected to the landscape of Australia such as deserts and grasslands. Landscape is a common subject in Aboriginal art.</p>

<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> by American architect<strong> Frank Gehry was constructed using titanium, glass, and limestone. </strong>This example of Post-Modern architecture stands in<strong> Bilbao, Spain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism</strong> used organic, rounded forms with asymmetrical designs rather than Modernist crisp, clean, long, straight lines.</p>
<p>This style is called <strong>deconstructivism</strong>. There is a bending and twisting of traditional styles to create a new aesthetic. This creates an unstable environment with unusual spatial arrangements. It looks bulging, warped, curling, tumbling. This is surprising to us because the look of the building disrupts our assumption that architecture is inherently stable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1754" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1754" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-B.jpg?resize=450%2C675&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="450" height="675" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1754" class="wp-caption-text">Guggenheim Museum Bilbao © Jacques Pavlovsky/Sygma/CORBIS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gehry described this work as “<strong>form follows fantasy</strong>”. It is a non-traditional building in both design and materials. He used a computer program called <strong>Catia</strong>, originally invented for aerospace engineering to design buildings.</p>
<p>The shiny <strong>titanium</strong> tiles that sheathe the building give it strength and shine. The look was inspired by the scales of fish. The fishing industry/shipbuilding industry was once a major part of Bilbao’s economy.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This building was constructed to serve as <strong>a museum of modern and contemporary art. </strong>The Guggenheim collection in NYC was too large for their space. This housed the overflow.</p>
<p>This building challenged the traditions of museum design and the thinking that it should be classical in form.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao </em></strong>is based on the curvature of the Guggenheim Museum in NYC. It also takes design cues from the Italian Baroque style of drapery and fabric, with bending, rippling, and unfurling.</p>
<p>Notice how the building <strong>looks like a ship</strong>. It is set by the water. The reflective quality of the building was intended to show the glittering water and sun’s reflection.</p>
<p>The<em> Spider </em>sculpture in front is entitled “Maman” by Louise Bourgeois. It means mother in French and was designed to show vulnerability, lightness, negative space.</p>
<p>The architect wanted to <strong>remove historical references</strong>. Most museums were done in variants of Neoclassicism – stone structures with pedimented fronts, colonnades, lofty and rational spaces.</p>
<p>The <strong>layout</strong> was an arrangement to focus on a central atrium with the 165-foot entrance.  This serves as a circulation hub and orientation gallery, providing access to the other 20 galleries on three levels.</p>
<p>The <strong>exhibition spaces </strong>have surprising shapes and does not follow the white cube method. Instead, it uses angled or curving walls and balconies. It is a complex and somewhat chaotic interior, with twisting glass-and-steel walls. It does not follow traditional Neoclassical design.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The building was very well received and the benefit to local economy was immediate and substantial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> was part of an ambitious urban renewal program to help the aging port and industrial city that had experienced significant decline in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Geographically, the location provided cheap land for a major museum, as opposed to a thriving European or American city. Deconstructivism’s fragmented forms represented uncertainty of contemporary life, like the downfall of Soviet Union the Berlin Wall and the 1987 stock market.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pure Land</em></strong> by artist <strong>Mariko Mori</strong> is a <strong>color photograph on glass</strong> measuring <strong>10 by 20 feet.</strong></p>
<p>Because it is printed on glass, the work has a shiny, reflective quality. The image was created using digital imagery and computer graphics. The huge scale uses the old art historical mentality that the size of the work indicates grandness, and significance.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This piece merges consumerism, entertainment, and traditional Japanese imagery together. It creates a modern space for and approach to Enlightenment. It shows we too can achieve Enlightenment in the modern age. This is a fusion of Japanese pop culture and traditional Japanese Buddhism.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>A female figure floats above a golden landscape above a lotus blossom. Six aliens play instruments and whirl. The artist depicted herself as <strong>Kichijoten, </strong>the <strong>Japanese goddess</strong> of happiness, fertility, beauty. Originally this was an Indian goddess incorporated into Buddhism. The pink and peach clothing mirrors the orange, yellow, and rose gold of the landscape.</p>
<p>The Dead Sea landscape, in which the image is set, is the lowest point on earth. Its high salinity does not support fish or plant life. In Shinto tradition, salt is used as purification in ceremonies.</p>
<p>The <strong>empty landscape</strong> is a reference to the Buddhist idea of emptiness that creates a calm state. <strong>Lotus blossom</strong> is a symbol of purity and rebirth. It is also a reference to Buddhism. <strong>Futuristic spacecraft</strong> may be a variation on a stupa the sacred Buddhist monument originally used as a reliquary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pure Land</em></strong> is the title, as well as the place where Buddhist devotees go after death. This is a common artistic subject in Japan. In these images, Buddha rested on a lotus blossom, surrounded by Bodhisattvas, the enlightened beings who do not pass on to nirvana. Pastel-colored aliens act as the Bodhisattva while Mori acts as Buddha. The figures are a reference to Japanese manga (graphic novels) and anime (films and TV).</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mariko Mori</strong> was born in Tokyo in 1967. She studied fashion and design and worked as a fashion model. Mori began to stage elaborate photo shoots, where she acted as director, producer, set designer, costume designer, and model.</p>
<p>The major question in post-WWII Japan is&#8211; <strong>how do we retain tradition and legacy, but modernize?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What makes this postmodern?</strong> This is art in a global context with an expansion of art object and artists.  Appropriation is key. There is a social critique as well as a revival of tradition.</p>

Materials with significance</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkytown Rebellion</em></strong> by artist <strong>Kara Walker</strong> is a <strong>cut paper and projection on wall</strong> measuring <strong>37 feet wide</strong>. It occupies a 37-foot-wide corner of a gallery. Colors are projected on a wall full of black silhouettes made of paper. These were deliberately made to be reminiscent of the Victorian era, which was the era of slavery.</p>
<p>Silhouettes were an inexpensive alternative to painted photographic portraits. Traditionally, they were a bust profile, cut out, affixed to a non-black background, and framed.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The viewer is forced to become a part of the scene. As we walk in front of it, we cast our own shadows.</p>
<p>It is impossible for us to ignore the history of slavery and we must choose what kind of player we will be.</p>
<p>The use of black paper is not just a reference to old Victorian silhouettes. These stories of slaves have been forgotten with no identifying information. The figures have become types. We will never know all of their stories.</p>
<p>Notice how quickly we recognize our stereotypes. We cannot see what race these figures actually are, and yet based upon their stereotypical features, we project information upon them. This work uses stereotypes to challenge how comfortable and recognizable they are.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This work depicts a scene from the pre-Civil War South. It shows slaves engaged in various acts of rebellion. At first glance, the colors and active figures make us think it is a parade or circus. Upon closer inspection, we realize this is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>There are 13 characters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flag bearers</li>
<li>Master taunting starving slave children</li>
<li>Nursing mother</li>
<li>Woman in hoop skirt attacking smaller slave</li>
<li>Various mutilated body parts</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject is a mix of fact and fantasy meant to evoke an emotional response. This is based on historical accounts of slave rebellions. Except for the outline of the bodies, all the subjects’ facial details are lost. The sitters are reduced to a few characteristics.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kara Walker</strong> is a famous multi-media artist who works with paper and black stereotypes. She is highly controversial for her role in drawing attention and perpetuating stereotypes. She argues that</p>
<p>we are so familiar with African American stereotypes such as Uncle Tom, Mammie, and Aunt Jemima.</p>
<p>Inspired by an anonymous 19<sup>th</sup> century landscape painting with African American caricatures painted into it entitled <strong><em>Darkytown</em></strong>, she began to read about slave rebellions and accounts. Responding to continued contemporary racial violence in the US, our role in racism is important and still relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> was in the Tate Modern</p>
<p><strong><em>Shibboleth</em></strong> by <strong>Doris Salcedo</strong> is an installation work of art measuring <strong>548 feet</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>temporary 548-foot-long series of fissures and cracks</strong> of varying width was in the floor of the gallery. This made viewers question it. Is it sculpture? Is it installation? Is it architecture?</p>
<p><strong>Can you make art by breaking it?</strong> This is so different from the “art is constructed/made” mentality.  Particularly with buildings, we associate cracks with structural cracks and danger. The crack was filled in but is still visible.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Produced for the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall (main hall).</li>
<li>Salcedo says this represents the immigrant experience and visibly shows separations, cracks, lack of unity.</li>
<li>Calls attention to divisions in ethnicity, politics, class, and culture.</li>
<li>Immigration marks people as “broken,” not “wholly a part of the group”.</li>
<li>Scars are a symbol of damage but also of the possibility of healing. Figurative and literal wounds, but also figurative and literal closure. That scar will always be there, always acting as a reminder.  We can cross over the divide to enact healing.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Shibboleth</strong> was the word used to distinguish people who belong from those who do not</p>
<p>Among the US military, the word lollapalooza was used during WWII since its tricky pronunciation could identify Asian speakers very clearly.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Salcedo was a Columbian immigrant living in the US and Europe</p>
<p>This work shows the fear of vulnerability, fear of being seen as different, as other, as an outcast, or as an immigrant. Sometimes there is a real danger to being seen as a foreigner and to being exposed. This speaks to the immigrant/refugee crises in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, but really since WWII.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this post-modernism?</strong>  There is an enlarge definition of art object/artist, globalization and social critique.</p>

Architecture</p>
<p><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts</strong> created by architect <strong>Zaha Hadid</strong> was constructed by using glass, steel, and cement. The building stands in <strong>Rome, Italy.</strong></p>
<p>You will notice in this work of <strong>Neo-Futurism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coiling, curving, elongated tube-like structures, fluid flow</li>
<li>Encourages free circulation</li>
<li>Futuristic with sharp edges/ De-emphasizes traditional elements like hallways or entryways</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Building has an L-shaped footprint with bending oblong tubes that overlap and intersect with each other</li>
<li>Pathways through the building overlap and connect to create a dynamic space</li>
<li>Continuity of space makes traditional galleries and exhibitions difficult</li>
<li>Curving walls</li>
<li>Open and naturally lit rooms</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>First museum of contemporary art in Italy which also was a community center</li>
<li>Unusual gallery design raised questions about displaying art; new challenges; one cannot use the White Cube Theory</li>

<p>The building houses galleries, permanent collections, temporary exhibitions, auditorium, reception services, a cafeteria, and bookshop. The Tiber River runs by.  Rivers are a metaphor for the whole building with twisting and curving lines.</p>
<h5><strong>Context  </strong></h5>
<p>The building cost 130 million Euros to develop.</p>
<p>There is a Post-Modern interest in creating spaces that are functional, flexible, free of historical association, and that act as community gatherings.</p>
<p>Outside a pedestrian walkway follows the outline of the building. It is built on the site of an Italian military barracks. This reclaims the space for the community&#8212; Just like Forbidden City, Dream of a Sunday Afternoon, Colosseum…</p>
<h5><strong>About the Architect </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Zaha Hadid (1950–2016)</strong> was an architect  who created striking structures in major cities, as well as gracefully designed products such as furniture, jewelry, lighting, and shoes. Other buildings of note include Beijing&#8217;s Galaxy Soho, the London Aquatics Center, and the Guangzhou Opera House.</p>

Revival of tradition</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> was in the Tate Modern Turbine Hall</p>
<p><strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds)</em></strong> by Chinese artist <strong>Ai Weiwei</strong> is a work that consists of <strong>100 million sunflower seeds</strong> made from <strong>sculpted and painted porcelain. </strong>Each was handcrafted and hand painted. Each one is essentially individual and unique.</p>
<p>The artist worked with 1600 artisans in Jingdzhen, the city known as the “Porcelain Capital” where Chinese artists produced pottery for 2,000 years. <strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds) </em></strong>provided employment for people in this city, while Ai Weiwei oversaw the production.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this work Post-Modern?</strong> This is a global artist, with a new art object, representing social critique, with a revival of tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The work is a critique on political and economic injustice. There is a sense of the small, tiny parts that make up the whole. Though each is incredibly small, they create a feeling of vastness.</p>
<p>Here there is a comparison between the individual vs. the group. The individual seed is lost among the millions. The critique of conformity and censorship is inherent in modern China. People who are unique must be the ones to cause change.</p>
<p>The artists used traditions of the past (traditional ceramic art) to critique Mao and communist history.</p>
<p>Mao tried to destroy traditional Chinese traditions and art. He failed.</p>
<p>People could touch, lay, walk on, and interact with the work. The viewer became a part of the experience. Initially, this was allowed but about a week into the exhibition, they realized this was crushing the seeds and the ceramic dust was toxic.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>100 million individual sunflower seeds weighing 150 tons</li>
<li>Each sunflower seed is porcelain</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why sunflower seeds?</strong> Sunflower seeds evoke Mao’s Communist propaganda (Mao was rendered as the sun and the citizens were sunflowers, turning their faces to Mao. Seeds show the promise of something that can grow and become. Seeds make plants self-perpetuating, but these seeds cannot grow anything.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a symbol of imperial culture in China. It was an important way that the West began to be exposed to Chinese art. The use of porcelain also comments on the long history of this prized material while also cleverly still being “Made in China”.</p>
<p>In the Cultural Revolution, Mao tried to destroy these traditions by destroying Chinese art. In 2011, Ai Weiwei was arrested for three months. He was released due to pressure from the art world. On his blog, he investigated the cover-ups and corruption in the government’s handling of a 2008 earthquake in China, as well as the country’s hosting of the Olympics.</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Revolution led to Ai Weiwei’s father, an esteemed poet in China, being sent to a communist labor camp. Before he died, Ai Weiwei’s father gave his son permission to speak out about Mao’s injustices and conformity in China. Ai Weiwei is following a Confucian tenet&#8211;respect for elders.</p>

<p>Contemporary art refers to the art and architecture of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century to the present. However, it is very diverse and constantly changing. How do contemporary artists move beyond traditional concepts about art and artists? How do information technology and global awareness together shape contemporary art? Here, you will explore the changing global, technological, environmental, political, and social landscapes of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries.</p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC </strong><strong>10.1 </strong><strong>Materials, Processes, and Techniques in Global Contemporary Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Global contemporary art</strong> is characterized by <strong>a transcendence of traditional conceptions of art</strong>. It is supported by technological developments and global awareness.</p>
<p>Hierarchies of materials, tools, function, artistic training, style, and presentation are challenged. Questions about <strong>how art is defined, valued, and presented</strong> are provoked by:</p>
<ul>
<li>ephemeral digital works,</li>
<li>video-captured performances</li>
<li>graffiti artists</li>
<li>online museums, and galleries</li>
<li>declines in (but preservation of) natural materials and traditional skills</li>
<li>predominance of disposable material cultures</li>
<li>the digital divide— access or lack of access to digital technology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital technology</strong> provides increased access to imagery and contextual information about diverse artists and artworks throughout history and across the globe.</p>

<p><strong><em>Horn Players </em></strong>by artist <strong>Jean-Michel </strong>Basquiat is an <strong>acrylic and oil paintstick on three canvas panels</strong> measuring <strong>18 feet by 6 feet 3 inches.  Paintstick</strong> is a “crayon” with various oils/pigments mixed in. This allows the artist to draw oil paint.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> is a<strong> triptych</strong> with a flat, dark background color uniting all three panels. Each canvas has flat patches of color and dense thick lines.</p>
<p>This <strong>Neo-Expressionism</strong> work retains rough handling, jagged forms and jarring color, but now has a focus on the body. Pride of place has made an exit as the important figures are off to the sides. Large sections of white paint seem to obscure what was underneath.</p>
<p>There is no sense of scale or balance. The artist relies heavily on juxtaposition and contrast to make the painting dynamic and expressive. The traditional approach to 3D space is gone.</p>
<h5><strong>What is the Function of <em>Horn Players</em>?</strong></h5>
<p>This work connects <strong>graffiti with jazz and fine art. </strong>Through this it elevates the practice of graffiti itself to a fine art. It also connects <strong>jazz to African American culture</strong> thereby honoring African American history and contributions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> was inspired by the scatting and improvisational work performed in jazz. <strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> replicates that technique here.</p>

<p>On the <strong>left panel</strong> Charlie Parker (saxophonist) plays his instrument and emits hot pink notes and sounds. On the <strong>central panel</strong> an abstracted head floats in space.</p>
<p>On the <strong>right panel</strong> Dizzy Gillespie (trumpeter) holds his trumpet along his side. The words DOH SHOO DE OBEE floats to the left. This reminds the viewer of Gillespie’s scat as a wordless improvisation.</p>
<h5><strong>Wordplay </strong></h5>
<p>A number of words appear on the canvases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dizzy</li>
<li>Ornithology (study of birds, as well as the title of a famous composition by Charlie Parker in reference to his own nickname Bird)</li>
<li>Pree (Parker’s daughter)</li>
<li>Teeth</li>
<li>Alchemy</li>
<li>Feet</li>
<li>Soap</li>
<li>Larynx misspelled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wordplay</strong> is a characteristic of Basquiat’s work, yet not all fully understood.</p>
<h5><strong>Common Subject Matter</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Musicians </strong>were a common subject for Basquiat. He had briefly played in a band. <strong>Anatomical terms</strong> were also common. His mother bought him a <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> textbook as a child for fun.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity to Picasso’s <em>Horn Players</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on <strong>Basquiat</strong> being called black the Picasso</li>
<li>We must draw upon our knowledge of traditional painting to understand this work</li>
<li>Triptych format echoes the trio of figures</li>
<li>Parker is in the same position as the standing figure with the clarinet in Picasso’s work</li>
<li>Central figure in Basquiat’s work is likened to the distorted face of the middle figure in Picasso’s</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Emergence of Urban Graffiti</strong></h5>
<p>Urban graffiti was an emerging artform in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Basquiat was one of the leaders.</p>
<h5><strong>About Jean-Michel Basquiat </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Basquiat</strong> was a homeless NYC queer man of color. He was a <strong>graffiti artist, sex worker and poet</strong>. Discovered in 1981 at age 20, he becomes dazzlingly successful at quick speed.</p>
<p>He was known for his tag SAMO (Same Old Shit) written in marker and spray paint on subway trains, sidewalks, and gallery walls. This attracted the attention of gallery owners and the art world.</p>
<p>Based on his success, critics referred to him as the “black Picasso”. While this likened him to Picasso, Basquiat felt conflicted about this term, because the word black was added.</p>
<p>He once said, “If you wanna talk about influence, man, then you’ve got to realize that influence is not influence. It’s simply someone’s idea going through my new mind.”</p>
<p>Some of his paintings have sold for $20 million. The artist died at the age of 27 from a heroin overdose.</p>
<h5><strong>Art News Update!</strong></h5>
<p>Andy Warhol’s portrait of Jean-Michel Basquiat was up for auction at Christie’s in November 2021.  The pre-estimate was US$20 million.</p>
<p>“From Brooklyn to China, Basquiat symbolizes a new generation, and Warhol recognized this earlier than anyone. His unmatched ability to capture celebrity, fame, glory, and tragedy culminates in this portrait,” Alex Rotter, Christie’s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art, said in a statement. “Just as much about Basquiat as it is about Warhol, it is one of the most exciting paintings to come to the auction market.”</p>
<p>How much did it sell for?</p>

<p><strong><em>Androgyne III</em></strong> by artist<strong> Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>is a work comprised of<strong> burlap, resin, wood, nails, and string </strong>measuring<strong> 4 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> burlap</strong> is manipulated into a figurative composition. It is meant to appear rough and course. This is an abstracted, simplified, dramatically reduced figure that is hollow with no head, forearms, or shins. A mold process was used to make the form out of burlap, with resin to stiffen it.</p>
<p>This  is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round</strong> and can also be viewed from the back.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is this Neo-Expressionism? </strong></h5>
<p>This work is a return to the body and the expressive capabilities of the bodies. This was believed to have been lost in Pop Art and Site-Specific Art. It is <strong>a rejection of the modernist attitude that the body is dead</strong>. Additionally, the style is a revival of Expressionism, with rough, jagged handling, and sharp forms. <strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This work examines the <strong>relationship between individual and community</strong> (isolation and loss). It notes <strong>dehumanization and lack of identity</strong> are the result of strife, war, anguish and derision.</p>
<p>It <strong>depicts isolation and loss</strong> in a universal way. We cannot identify this figure specifically. So much of this figure has been lost, destroyed and hurt. Our own identities become lost and are vulnerable in our modern, violent worlds.</p>
<p><strong>We identify and recognize this figure</strong> even though we see SO little of it. Destruction leaves us as shells of who we once were.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>androgynous figure</strong> focuses on humanity, rather than gender. Notice  the body language. The shoulders are pulled forward, with a slumping back.</p>
<p>The figure in deep despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>wrinkled skin</li>
<li>backbone</li>
<li>musculature</li>
<li>veins</li>
<li>missing limbs and head</li>
</ul>
<p>It is elevated from the floor by a wood structure as a base. Does this fill in for the legs?  Is this a wheelchair? Gurney?</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>was considered <strong>a pioneer of fiber-based sculpture. </strong>Her art was affected by her experiences in Poland, under Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II.</p>
<p>Born in 1930, she lived on a large estate in Poland. Here she often played in the woods. She said this later inspired her to use natural materials in her works.</p>
<p>In WWII, German tanks entered her family’s estate. Later a drunk German soldier burst into the house and shot off her mother’s arm in front of her. In 1944, the family fled, as the Soviet army arrived and moved into Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>Abakanowicz</strong> worked as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded. This would later affect her art.</p>
<p>When the war was over, she attended art school at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Warsaw. Poland was a part of the Soviet Bloc. Social Realism was the style taught in art schools with smiling workers and images of a perfect society. She tried to avoid learning this style by choosing to work with textiles. Yet,  she had to adopt it to obtain a degree and enter the Polish Artist Union.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre, </em></strong><strong>from the series <em>The French Collection, Part I; #1</em>.,</strong> is a work by artist <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> that uses <strong>acrylic on canvas, with a tie-dyed, pieced fabric border</strong>. The artwork measures 6 feet 3 inches by 6 feet and 9 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> calls this work a <strong>story-quilt</strong>. She creates <strong>a central image using acrylic paint on canvas</strong>, then surrounds it with a patchwork cloth border that includes her <strong>handwritten text</strong>. In this way, she <strong>utilizes text and image together</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, she sandwiches a layer of batting underneath the canvas and on top of another piece of cloth. The figures are simple, flat, and stiff with a space that is shallow.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Through her art, she can rewrite the past through weaving together the history of African Americans and women. This is an alternative to the white masculine narratives that are prevalent in art history. This highlights the ways in which African-Americans and their experiences have been left out. Through most of history they have not been the subjects or the intended audiences of Western painting.</p>
<p><strong>Ringgold’s</strong> technique challenges the definition of painting and <strong>fine art</strong>. She has used acrylic on canvas but has mixed in the prominent <strong>folk art</strong>/craft tradition of quilting. Folk art is often defined in part by being produced by untrained artists.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This is the first in Ringgold’s series of twelve “story quilts” called <strong><em>The French Collection. </em></strong>The story tells the fictional narrative of Willa Marie Simone, a young black woman who moves to Paris in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Willa Marie’s adventures in Paris in the 1920s lead her to meet celebrities: Picasso, Matisse, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Josephine Baker.</p>
<p>The <strong>three paintings</strong> that the work shows as a backdrop at the Louvre are <strong>all by DaVinci</strong>: <em>Madonna and Child and St. Anne; Mona Lisa; Virgin of the Rocks</em>. Note all of the paintings are of woman and girls.</p>
<p>The girls dancing in front of the art become the show – instead of the historical white version on the walls!</p>
<h5><strong>Text on this image</strong></h5>
<p><em>Marcia and her three little girls took me dancing at the Louvre. I thought I was taking them to see the Mona Lisa, but you’ve never seen anything like this. Well, the French hadn’t either. Nevermind Leonardo da Vinci and Mona Lisa, Marcia and her three girls were the show</em>.</p>
<h5><strong>Art Expansion </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This work is an expansion of the art world and the art object. <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> is African American woman, and the art object is now a folk art/fine art hybrid. This reflects shifts into post-Modernism.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism</strong> rejects Modernism’s emphasis on universal meaning and abstraction.</p>
<h5><strong>Why the Story Quilts were Made </strong></h5>
<p>Ringgold’s story-quilting technique is important. <strong>Her mother was a fashion designer and seamstress</strong>. When her mother died in 1981, Ringgold started making these quilts.</p>
<p>Quilts have been associated with <strong>women’s domestic work</strong> and <strong>women’s connections with one another. </strong></p>
<p>Quilting is often done collectively. Young girls watch and participate to learn family stories, cultural backgrounds, and technical skills.</p>
<p>Quilts were of particular importance to the history of African Americans. On the Underground Railroad, codes and hidden messages were sewn onto quilts in safe houses that could help slaves find more secret routes and safe houses to the North.</p>

<p><strong><em>Electronic Superhighway</em></strong> by artist <strong>Nam June Paik</strong> is a <strong>mixed-media installation (49-channel closed-circuit video installation, neon, steel, and electric components)</strong> measuring 15 by 40 feet.</p>
<p>This huge, towering stack of TVs simultaneously shows multiple clips from a variety of sources. His studio was small, so he had to squish Texas and Florida . In total there are 336 TVs: 3,750 feet of cable and 575 feet of colored tubing.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist used video to show the speed of our increasingly <strong>electronic modern lives</strong>. It also celebrates an <strong>America influenced by film and television</strong>.</p>
<p>How have these things shaped who we think we are? How are we connected to each other via media? Is the effect of technology always a good thing? Can we have information overload?</p>
<p>This is <strong>a contrast between</strong> actual road trips, with a trip across the US in the gallery, with virtual travel on the Internet.</p>
<p>Notice the size and energy. All this plays into the American identity Paik was captivated by.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>An <strong>enormous scale</strong> suggests  the huge size of the nation. There is a map of the US with <strong>neon</strong> outlining the states. Neon reminded him of the signs for motels and restaurants that dot the highways. Different colors remind us that states have different identities.</p>
<p><strong>Images</strong> are flashing and rapidly changing. This is reminiscent of billboards being seen from passing cars.</p>
<p>Within each state, the screens display video clips that resonate with each state’s own identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kansas: <em>Wizard of Oz </em>(film)</li>
<li>Oklahoma: <em>Oklahoma </em>(film)</li>
<li>Iowa: footage of presidential candidates</li>
<li>Idaho: potatoes</li>
<li>Missouri: <em>Meet Me in St. Louis </em>(film)</li>
<li>Texas: cowgirls, cactus</li>
<li>New York: Empire State Building</li>
<li>Maine: clips of a friend</li>
<li>California: hallucinogens, Golden Gate Bridge, OJ Simpson</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p>Nam June Paik was born in Seoul, in 1932. He was considered <strong>the father of video art</strong>, with his first video art exhibit in 1963.</p>
<p>When Paik came to the US in 1964, the interstate highway system was only 9 years old. Highways offered everyone the freedom to see the USA. Highways were new and heavily advertised, as a way for Americans to see the country on a limited budget.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh</p>
<p><strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> a work by artist <strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> was created using <strong>ink and acrylic on canvas</strong> and measures <strong>9 by 12 feet. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Total abstraction</li>
<li>Black lines create centrifugal structure</li>
<li>Various shards of color float over the work’s black skeleton</li>
<li>Notice gray painterly marks that rise from the lower registers to the upper registers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visually, the work looks similar to Kandinsky! </strong>How does Mehretu do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Overlaps architectural plans, urban plans, diagrams, photos, graffiti, maps, abstract shapes, etc. on top of one another to create an illusion of depth and movement</li>
<li>Built up in layers and layers of drawing, and then many applications of paint</li>
<li>Mixture of drawing and painting</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>portrays chaos in the modern world. </strong>It invokes our experiences of being in busy, in collective spaces. It captures the speed, energy, and chaos of a globalized, hectic world.</p>
<p>What are the results of our interconnectedness, our globalization?</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumerism (corporate logos)</li>
<li>National identities and propaganda</li>
<li>Religious symbols</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference to Kandinsky is important. Remember, Kandinsky and Mondrian believed pure abstraction could bring us together. Mehretu’s work is abstraction speaking about universalism and collectivity!</p>
<p>Title of the work, <strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> refers to arenas and stadiums</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Places where national identities, power, commerce, entertainment, sport, and conflict merge.</li>
<li>Should remind us of the circular spaces of a sports arena or amphitheater.</li>
<li>Imagine the energy of spectators, the matching colors, signs, and banners held overhead,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Visualization of the energy, sound, enthusiasm of a group of people</li>
<li>Colors allude to the French, Russian, American, Chinese, and Japanese flags, as well as there being crosses and corporate logos</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> is Ethiopian born and works in NYC with her partner who is also an artist.</p>
<p>Stadiums in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century are increasingly important spaces.  They are places for Olympics, nationalist fervor, other sports, religious gatherings, political rallies, and concerts.</p>
<p>In today’s world they are also places for <strong>terrorist attacks</strong> that focus on large numbers of people.</p>
