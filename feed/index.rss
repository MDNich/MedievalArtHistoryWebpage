<h4><strong>Indigenous Influence</strong></h4>
<p>Science uses the term <strong>mixture</strong> to describe when two things are blended. There are times in which you can see the different elements of a mixture—like in soil. There are also times in which you cannot, like when sugar is dissolved in water. It still looks like water, but when you taste it, the influence is there.</p>
<p><strong>Geography, economics, government, belief systems, external cultural influences, and technology</strong> are influences that historically impact a culture and subsequently <strong>impact the art and architec</strong>ture of that culture. <strong>European impact within the Indigenous Americas began in 1492</strong>, and you will explore the archeological and art historical impact of this influence.</p>
<p><strong>Art of the Indigenous Americas is classified chronologically and geographically</strong> into two designations: <strong>Native North America and Ancient America</strong>. European influence is like sugar dissolved in water; it has permeated the art of these regions but has not defined it.</p>
<p>The term <strong>indigenous</strong> is important because it signifies concentration on the cultures before European influence in 1492.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Native North America and Ancient America have roots in Asia, stemming from the prehistoric migration</strong>, but developed independently between 10,000 B.C.E and 1492 C.E. when European influence began.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient America classifies art created before 1550 C.E. south of the U.S.-Mexico border</strong>. The region is divided into three main areas of culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andean South America</li>
<li>Mesoamerica</li>
<li>Central America</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cultural influences</strong> in these regions include the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chavín</li>
<li>Olmec</li>
<li>Maya</li>
<li>Teotihuacan</li>
<li>Toltec</li>
<li>and Mexica (or Aztec).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Andean South America: The Chavín</strong></h5>
<p>The Andes Mountains of South America, which cross from Peru into Bolivia, saw the development of the Chavín and similar societies. These cultures practiced <strong>shamanism</strong>, a traditional belief system in which shamans achieve various powers through trance or ecstatic religious experience and can heal the sick and communicate with the otherworld and dead. As part of shamanism, they had a <strong>devotion to the animal and plant worlds</strong> as part of the practice of shamanistic religion and stressed survival and communion with challenging environments. <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong> was an important religious center. As a pilgrimage site and sacred space, people from the surrounding areas would travel to Chavín in search of religious experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Map of the Chavín culture.</strong></p>
<h5><strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> is at the site where two rivers join. Geographically is considered a tinkuay, or harmonious meeting of opposing forces, in shamanistic religion. This is significant, as travel would have been simplified for pilgrims.</p>
<p>The <strong>Old Temple</strong> is a flat-topped pyramid made of stone and u-shaped surrounding a round sunken plaza. The u-shape and sunken plaza indicate that this was an area for large gatherings for worship. Archeological evidence indicates that the building was added to over a series of hundreds of years, culminating in a larger temple and an additional rectangular-shaped sunken plaza. The Old Temple lacked windows and had a series of elaborate, maze-like tunnels that led to the <strong>Lanzón Stela</strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is representative of a central figure depicted as a feline head and human body that was worshiped.</p>
<p>Those who entered the temple to encounter the <strong>Lanzón Stela</strong> would need to rely on torches to light their way, which could enhance the possible religious visions. Relief sculptures with images similar to those on the Lanzón Stela are on the walls around the temple, further reinforcing the worship of the deity.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Comparison:  How does the Chavín de Huántar compare to other sacred architecture?</strong></h5>
<h5><strong><em>Chartres Cathedral</em></strong></h5>
<p>Also a pilgrimage destination, the <strong><em>Chartres Cathedral</em></strong> is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and is one of the oldest Christian shrines in France. It is the site where a piece of linen is kept that is believed to have been worn by the Virgin Mary when she gave birth to Jesus. This linen is believed to have healing powers and, therefore, is the focus of religious pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The <strong>European Gothic cathedral</strong> has a u-shaped cross (basic early Christian Basilica) floor plan and was constructed in several stages and is permeated with <strong>stained-glass windows</strong>. Large amounts of natural light to enter the chapel. This light was referred to as lux nova as it entered through what were considered sacred windows.</p>
<p>Featured on the west façade are a large, round stained-glass window and the <strong>Royal Portal</strong>. The Royal Portal features sculptures of biblical kings and queens on the columns. Above is Christ on a throne surrounded by four evangelists, an example of early Gothic sculpture.</p>

<h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
<p>Both <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong> and <strong><em>Chartres Cathedral</em></strong> have objects that worshipers see to encounter sacred experiences, and, therefore, they functioned as pilgrimage destinations. They were both constructed in several stages to accommodate their sacred function. While <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong> is impacted by the lack of windows and natural light, the <strong><em>Chartres Cathedral’s</em></strong> extensive stained-glass windows use an extraordinary amount of natural light to meet worship needs.</p>
<h5><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica and Central America</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica and Central America</strong> encompassed what are now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and western Honduras from 15,000 B.C.E. to 1521 C.E. and featured three major distinct cultures: the <strong>Olmec, Maya, and Mexica (or Aztec).</strong></p>
<p>These cultures succeeded each other as the previous declined, functioned with similar calendars, and built pyramidal stepped structures, sites, and buildings oriented in relation to sacred mountains and celestial phenomena. Green materials like jadeite and quetzal feathers were highly valued, as they were considered rare and symbolically associated with life and death.</p>
<p>These three cultures placed a large emphasis on <strong>blood sacrifice in their worship</strong> of a vast <strong>group of deities</strong>, and <strong>players of a ceremonial ball game would occasionally be sacrificed</strong>. They were hierarchical: a privileged, elite class dominated the political and religious landscape, building large ceremonial complexes as monuments to victory, the gods, and the dead.</p>
<p>Architectural styles between the Olmec, Maya, and Mexica cultures differed greatly. <strong>Olmec pyramids</strong> began as early earthworks. <strong>Mayan temples</strong> were nine-level structures with single temples, and the <strong>Mexica culture</strong> built similar structures with twin temples. The architecture transitioned to mainly stone post-and-lintel, often faced with relief sculpture and painted bright colors.</p>

<p>Plazas were typical for large ritual gatherings. Elaborate burials and other underground installations to honor the role of the underworld were also found. Sacred sites were renovated and enlarged repeatedly over the centuries, resulting in acropolis and massive temples.</p>
<h5><strong>The Olmec (1300 B.C.E.-200 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Olmec culture</strong> existed during the first millennium B.C.E., primarily in the <strong>Gulf Coast, Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras</strong>, and was the earliest Mesoamerican culture to build monumental sculpture. Four major Olmec centers contain the ruins of public ceremonial architecture and numerous stone monuments, with pyramids dominating the landscape. Several themes and motifs present in Olmec art and architecture are repeated throughout the history of Mesoamerica. The Olmecs valued <strong>greenstone</strong>, as green represented life and nature, producing some of Mesoamerica’s largest carvings in serpentine.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have reconstructed Olmec beliefs by comparing their art, architecture, and writing with later, similar cultures like the Mayans and Mexica. The <strong>earliest known religious practices were shamanistic</strong>. Shamans interacted with nature spirits like frogs, birds, and jaguars. Recurring motifs like the feathered serpent and rain deity were religiously important to the culture, and this importance is reflected within the art of the culture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2615" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?resize=893%2C509&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="893" height="509" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Map of the Olmec culture.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Altar of the Children</strong></h5>
<p>Most of the Olmec art we have relates to power and the supernatural world. A good example of a melding of these two themes can be seen in Olmec altar-thrones. These monolithic stone blocks have a flat top with a projecting edge. Originally considered altars, these blocks may have served as thrones. The front face of most altars follows a typical iconography.</p>
<p>A ruler, identifiable by headdress, is carved in high relief, sitting in a large niche. The niche is like a cave and symbolizes the underworld, the source of supernatural power. The power of such a ruler, therefore, comes from his association with the gods.</p>
<p>On Altar 5, this association deepens as we look at the child in the lap of the ruler. Although its face has been worn down, we can see a similar child carved on the side of the altar-throne in low relief.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2616" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=805%2C631&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="805" height="631" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900–400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=768%2C602&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Altar 5. Altar of the Children. </strong><strong>Olmec. La Venta, Mexico. 900–400 B.C.E.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Why so Mad?</strong></h5>
<p>Note that the child has an indented head and appears to be snarling. Archaeologists have postulated that this is a were-jaguar, or jaguar-baby. Such jaguar children are common motifs, unique to Olmec art, and a lot of speculation has ensued regarding their purpose.</p>
<p>One speculation is that they allude to a creation myth in which a woman mates with a jaguar, giving rise to a race of jaguar-people. Some statues depict adult jaguar-people, possibly shamans involved in transformation. Olmecs repeatedly used jaguars in art.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Jaguar Mask</strong></h5>
<p>Here’s another example of jaguar usage. This jaguar mask is a mosaic pavement made of serpentine. It was purposefully covered with clay and buried in several layers of dirt. Olmecs buried many works of art, possibly for spiritual reasons.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2619" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jaguar-mask.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-ca.-1000–600-B.C.E.-Mosaic-pavement..jpg?resize=807%2C606&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="807" height="606" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jaguar-mask.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-ca.-1000–600-B.C.E.-Mosaic-pavement..jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jaguar-mask.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-ca.-1000–600-B.C.E.-Mosaic-pavement..jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Jaguar mask</em>. Olmec. La Venta, Mexico. ca. 1000–600 B.C.E. Mosaic pavement.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Warrior</strong></h5>
<p>Not every work of Olmec art was otherworldly or spiritual. This colossal head, known by the nickname The Warrior, is one of many such sculptures. Carved from basalt, The Warrior portrays a powerful face with high cheekbones, hooded eyes, full lips, and a broad nose. He wears a close-fitting cap, and his fleshy earlobes are weighted with large round earspools–personal ornaments inserted in the stretched space of pierced earlobes.</p>
<p>Approximately 134 of these enormous sculptures have been found, ranging in height from 5 to 12 feet and weighing from 5 to more than 20 tons. Each face is naturalistic and individualized. We also have evidence of the deliberate defacement of some heads. This evidence indicates that the heads were probably portraits of specific rulers and a testament to their power.</p>

<h5><strong>The Maya (250 B.C.E.-1521 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Maya</strong> are still very much in existence. They emerged out of the Olmec decline around 250 B.C.E primarily in modern day <strong>Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala</strong>, and their descendants still thrive and maintain their traditions and beliefs.</p>
<p>The Maya <strong>used astronomy</strong> to chart the movements of Venus and the moon, create tables identifying their positions in the sky, and predict solar eclipses. Astronomy helped the Maya devise a complex calendar based on a solar year of 365 days, as with our modern calendar. It was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, plus an unlucky five-day period. There was a separate sacred year lasting 260 days, as well as other calendrical cycles.</p>
<p>The Maya are renowned for their <strong>technological and cultural accomplishments</strong>. They <strong>developed the most sophisticated hieroglyphic writing in Mesoamerica and perfected the calendar</strong> used throughout the region. Scholars of astronomy, mathematics, plants, and animals, they built great cities with pyramids, temples, necropolises, palaces, and government structures.</p>

<p><strong>Map of the Maya culture</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Temple of the Giant Jaguar</strong></h5>
<p>To the ancient Maya, <strong>pyramids were stairways to the heavens</strong>. They would have been expressions of power and displays of propaganda for residents and strangers alike.</p>
<p>The pyramids often enclosed tombs. A flat area at the top provided space for a temple. Access to the temple was by a long, steep staircase. The number of staircases reflects the number of entries to the temple.</p>
<p><strong><em>Temple I</em></strong> at Tikal is a 145-foot-tall pyramid that was the temple-mausoleum of Hasaw Chan K’awiil (r. 682-734 CE), the most important ruler of Tikal’s 7th CE resurgence who defeated Calakmul, Tikal&#8217;s greatest rival, in 695 CE and oversaw a significant rebuilding program in the city. The most impressive new buildings were the massive <strong>pyramids </strong>known simply as <strong><em>Temple I and II.</em></strong></p>
<p>The nine tiers of the pyramid probably refer to the nine levels of the Mayan Underworld.</p>
<p>The ornate structure that tops this example is a roof comb, which would have been brightly painted. The talud-tablero <strong>structure of the pyramids is evidence of the lasting influence of Teotihuacán architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>Another typical Maya feature is the sculpture of <strong>stone</strong> slabs to depict rulers and record their greatest accomplishments. Such <strong>stelae</strong> were set up in rows along the sides of the plazas. The oldest example of these stelae in Mesoamerica was discovered at Tikal and dates to 292 CE. It shows a ruler holding in his left hand the Jaguar God of the Underworld, probably a patron god of Tikal.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Overview</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Tikal </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Settlement at Tikal began from around 300 BCE</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> and, first clearing away areas in the jungle, monumental </span><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">architecture</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> was built in the period up to 100 CE. The city&#8217;s prosperity was based on exploitation of natural resources such as cedar wood, dye from Brazil wood, copal resin, flint, and cultivating maize in cleared areas of rainforest and fertile swamp areas.</span></p>
<p>In 378 CE Tikal was invaded by forces from distant <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> (or at the very least <strong>trade</strong> contacts were established) with a consequent influence on the cultural practices at Tikal, from clothes to art and architecture. From the late 4th century CE, Tikal was able to further expand its sphere of influence and <strong>conquer</strong> long-time local rivals. In the 6th century CE, the power of Teotihuacan declined, and other Maya cities, notably Caracol, sought military expansion, defeating Tikal in 562 CE.</p>
<p>However, by the 7th century CE Tikal regained its place as an important Maya city, contemporary with such centers as <strong>Palenque, Copan</strong>, and Tikal&#8217;s greatest rival Calakmul. Tikal consisted of nine different plazas and courts connected by causeways and ramps and has, in all, over 3,000 structures.</p>
<p><strong>Xibalba</strong> (Shee-bal-ba) was the name the K&#8217;iche <strong>Maya</strong> gave to the underworld, and it translates as &#8216;Place of Fright&#8217;, which indicates the terror the place had in the Maya imagination. Only those who died a violent<strong> death</strong> avoided Xibalba.</p>
<p>The underworld was a truly fearsome place, strongly associated with water. it had its own landscape, gods, and blood-thirsty predators. The Milky Way was also considered an entrance to Xibalba and the road along which souls walked to meet their fate.</p>
<p>The Maya, believing <strong>the underworld had nine different levels</strong>, represented this idea in the gigantic stone pyramids they built as tombs for their kings which often have nine tiers. See, for example, the <strong>Temple</strong> of the Inscriptions at Palenque, <strong><em>Temple I</em> at Tikal</strong>, or the <em><strong>Pyramid of Kukulcan</strong></em> at Chichen Itza.</p>
<p>The Maya also believed that each astronomical god had its own manifestation in the underworld. For example, the Sun God K&#8217;inich Ajaw, when he was travelling through the underworld at night, became the Jaguar God of the Underworld.</p>
<p>The <strong>most important Maya religious book, <em>the Popol Vuh</em></strong>, describes some details of the geography within Xibalba. To reach the ninth level of Xibalba, many trials and dangers had to be faced by the dead. These included the crossing of dangerous waters and high mountains, rivers of blood, attack by spinning obsidian knives and arrows, and even the sacrifice of one&#8217;s heart. To help the soul survive such an ordeal, the dead were buried or cremated with useful pieces of equipment such as weapons, tools, weaving kits, precious goods like jade, sustaining food such as hot chocolate, and even dogs (real or <strong>pottery</strong> effigies) to act as companions and guides.</p>

<h5><strong>El Castillo Pyramid</strong></h5>
<p>The most powerful of the Late Classic/Post-Classic Maya settlements is Chichén Itzá, which flourished for almost four hundred years.</p>
<p>The name means &#8220;opening of the wells of the Itzá.&#8221; The &#8220;wells&#8221; referred to the large cenotes, or sinkholes, at the site.</p>
<p>The Itzá themselves were Mayan–speaking people who arrived in the region around 800 C.E.</p>
<p>The most prominent structure in <strong>Chichén Itzá</strong> is the pyramid, <strong><em>El Castillo</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>Temple of Kukulcán</em></strong>. <strong><em>El Castillo</em></strong> is oriented to the four compass points, and each staircase has 91 steps. Including the platform  there are a total of 365 steps&#8211;the number of days in the year. Kukulcán was a deity approximately equivalent to Quetzalcóatl, the Feathered Serpent.</p>

<h5><strong><em>Pyramid of Kukulcán</em></strong></h5>
<p>The observatory at Chichén Itzá, with its snail-shaped dome and precisely oriented windows, was designed for astronomical observation.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> at Chichén Itzá has features quite different from that of Tikal (first image), reflecting its more cosmopolitan population. The pyramid is lower and wider in shape than those in other cities. Rooms are larger, and the use of pillars and columns appear for the first time. Although there is a ball court, its proportions are enormous and was more likely used for ritual purposes rather than for games.</p>

<h5><strong>Toltec Atlantids at Tula</strong></h5>
<p>One of the non-Maya influences on Chichén Itzá is that of the <strong>Toltecs</strong>, whose main city was at Tula. These atlantean columns—or atlantids—function much as caryatids did in ancient Greek architecture. Unfortunately, the roof no longer exists, but we can get a sense of the fierceness of these warrior people through their sculpture. These atlantids are spear-throwers, with drum headdresses and butterfly pectorals.</p>
<p>They were originally covered in bright, polychromatic paint. Each column is made of four stone drums attached with dowels, and this, coupled with the similarity in look, suggests mass production.</p>

<h5><strong>The Mexica (or Aztec) (1428-1521 C.E.)</strong></h5>
<p>After the Mayan culture, several cultures succeed each other, including the <strong>Teotihuacan and the Toltecs</strong>. The <strong>Mexica, or Aztec</strong>, Empire followed.</p>
<p>The <strong>history of the Mexica is documented in the <em>Codex Mendoza</em></strong><em>.</em> Antonio de Mendoza, the first Spanish viceroy of New Spain, commissioned native scribes and painters to produce the illustrated manuscript recounting the history of the Aztec (or Mexica) Empire. This manuscript echoes the style of Aztec manuscripts created before.</p>
<p>The Mexica (or Aztec) existed from 1428 to 1521 C.E. in the region of central Mexico. They began as a group of soldiers settling on a swampy island in Lake Texcoco. They called themselves the Mexica and claimed to be nomads from the mystical land of Aztlan in the north.</p>
<p>The Mexica would forge the Aztec Empire in the span of a century. Because of a 19th-century popularization of the name Aztec, they are referred to by the name of their empire. However, within their own culture, modern descendants still consider themselves Mexica.</p>
<p>The <strong>Aztec (Mexica) Empire</strong> consisted of the three city-states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenochtitlan</strong></li>
<li><strong>Texcoco</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tlacopan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tenochtitlan</strong> was the Mexica home city. According to legend, its location was chosen by the god Huitzilopochtli, who told the Mexica their wanderings would be over when they saw the mystical sign of an eagle resting on a prickly cactus and eating a snake.</p>
<p>The Mexica realized that vision at the site where they later built their home city. Originally on a swampy island, Tenochtitlan would be systematically expanded using <strong>chinampas</strong>, which were artificial islands built up as agricultural fields.</p>

<h5><strong>May the Gods Be with You</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Aztec (Mexica)</strong> religion had a complex combination of deities combined with ancient deities long worshiped in Mexico. The chief god worshiped was Huitzilopochtli (Hummingbird of the South), a war, sun, and fire deity. He was the son of Coatlicue (She of the Serpent Skirt) and sibling to the Centzon Huitznahua (Four Hundred Southerners) and Coyolxauhqui (She of the Golden Bells).</p>
<p>The Centzon Huitznahua and Coyolxauhqui were jealous when they discovered that Coatlicue was pregnant with Huitzilopochtli and murdered her. Then, at the moment of her death, she gave birth to Huitzilopochtli who then killed Coyolxauhqui and most of the Centzon Huitznahua. He then dismembered Coyolxauhqui and threw her body down Coatepec Mountain.</p>
<p>Other deities were assimilated from the cultures the Mexica conquered, along with the arts and methods of artmaking. This is evidenced in artworks like the <strong>Olmec-style mask</strong>. The natural features, square jaw, and materials used to make this mask are examples of Olmec influence.</p>

<p>The ritual cycle celebrated events in two calendars: a sacred calendar of 260 days and a solar calendar of 360 days (plus five unlucky days and nameless days). The two calendars overlapped once every 52 years, when a ritual called the New Fire Ceremony would take place.</p>
<p><strong>The Aztec (Mexica) Calendar Stone</strong>, a 25-ton stone, is often mistaken for a working calendar but it is a representation of the end of times. Aztecs (Mexicas) believed that the world had cycled through previous incarnations.</p>
<p>In the Aztec (Mexica) account, there had been four previous suns. The fifth sun, which represents our current age, would eventually disappear from the heavens, ushering in a new age.</p>
<p>The Mexica practiced bloodletting and human sacrifice to please Huitzilopochtli and sustain the great cycles of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Mesoamerican calendars</strong> had commonalities with European calendars, such as visions of the end of the world, both in the past (Noah&#8217;s Flood) and in the future (the Revelation of St. John). As in the Maya Long Count, Europeans started their calendars fixed on a single date: the birth of Christ. Aztecs (Mexicas), unlike the Maya, did not use a long count rooted in a past origin.</p>
<h5><strong>The Aztec (Mexica) Calendar Stone</strong></h5>
<p>Aztecs (Mexicas), like the Maya and other</p>
<p>Mesoamerican cultures before them, believed that the world had cycled through previous incarnations.</p>

<h5><strong>Center of Ring</strong></h5>
<p>At the center of the Calendar Stone is the outline of the glyph for Movement, one of the day signs, and the sign for the sun of this age. Four previous suns are shown within the outline. Each name day depicts how the age ended. Four-Wind, the glyph in the upper left, marked an age of the world destroyed by lethal winds. Four-Movement, then, would supposedly end in an earthquake. Perhaps that is why the central face on the Calendar Stone (sometimes mistaken for the sun god) is the face of the earth monster with her claws holding human hearts. This stone was likely placed on the ground to be a recipient of sacrifices.</p>

<h5><strong>Tenochtitlan</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>ruins of Tenochtitlan lie directly beneath the center of Mexico City</strong>, and at the center of Tenochtitlan was the <strong>sacred precinct with the <em>Templo Mayor</em></strong>. This pyramid-temple honored Huitzilopochtli. Two staircases went up the plaza levels to the top where two sanctuaries sat side by side. It contained seven shells, or layers, of walls nestled inside each other. Walls were built around the temple to enlarge it, resulting in superimposition.</p>
<p>At the base of the stairs was <strong><em>The Coyolxauhqui Stone</em></strong>. The stone has the image of Coyolxauhqui&#8217;s dismembered body, accented by carvings of skulls and bones underneath that could be the representations of the Centzon Huitznahua. When the Aztecs (Mexicas) sacrificed their conquered enemies at the top of the Great Temple, they would ritualistically reenact the actions of Huitzilopochtli when he threw Coyolxauhqui&#8217;s dismembered body down the stairs.</p>

<h5><strong>Sculpture and Sacred Space</strong></h5>
<p>Sculpture is a significant portion of Mexica art found in Tenochtitlan. The massive statue of Coatlicue, mother of Huitzilopochtli, contains symbolism of her death. A pair of serpent heads have come out of her neck where she has been decapitated, symbols of flowing blood. She wears a necklace of human hands, hearts, and skulls along with a skirt of snakes as evidence of the deity’s need for human sacrifice. The original setting of this statue is unknown, and it was found near Mexico City’s cathedral.</p>
<p>As evidenced by <strong><em>Templo Mayor</em></strong> and <strong><em>Chavín de Huántar</em></strong>, varied manifestations of a sacred space reflect the cultural and religious context. The sacred space reflects the religious and functional needs of the people or culture. The use of religious space as pilgrimage and sacrificial sites changes based on the cultural and religious need. Each site was increased and superimposed based on the religious need, used to worship deities, and experience religious experiences.</p>
<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is classified chronologically and geographically into two designations: <strong>Native North America and Ancient America</strong>. Several cultures, including the <strong>Chavín, Olmec, Maya, and Mexica, comprise Ancient American art </strong>and include some of the oldest artistic traditions within colonization and migrant peoples, traditions that dominated the continent for the past 500 years. As part of worship in these cultures, artwork and architecture took on sacred functions to fulfill the needs in worship.</p>

<h4><strong>Cultural Misconception</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Bury Your Head in the Sand</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever heard that goldfish have a three-second memory? Or the idiom, “Don’t bury your head in the sand?” Both are common slang, or vernacular, and misconceptions.</p>
<p>Goldfish have a long-term memory of around three to six months. And “burying your head in the sand” is a reference to ostriches putting their heads in the ground when scared or afraid. In reality, ostriches put their heads in the ground to check on and turn their eggs, which are buried.</p>
<p>Cultural background influences common misconceptions and ironically causes misconceptions about other cultures.</p>
<p>Think about a different nationality or culture other than your own, and imagine what an example of an individual from that culture would look like, what they would wear, what they would eat, or how they would talk. You automatically have a certain idea in your head about each because you view other cultures through the perspective of your own culture.</p>
<p>When <strong>the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in Tenochtitlan, misconceptions influenced their reaction to the Aztec (Mexica) priests</strong>. These misconceptions fueled the conquest of Mexico—they thought that it was crucial to <strong>conquer the indigenous peoples and convert them to Christianity</strong>.</p>
<p>Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a soldier who accompanied Hernan Cortés on his expedition, wrote of his shock in seeing a group of foul-smelling priests with uncut fingernails, long hair matted with blood, and ears covered in cuts. They assumed, based on their cultural perception, that they were savages, when the priests were the most highly educated Aztecs.</p>
<p>The priests were performing rites in honor of the deities they worshiped, including piercing their skin with cactus spines to draw blood. This shocked the Spanish Conquistadors—they viewed the customs as degrading, and their accounts skewed the views of the King of Spain and popular opinion about Aztec (Mexica) and Ancient American culture to this day.</p>
<p>An individual’s cultural filter can contort the accuracies and/or purposes of Ancient American art and its traditions. Examining cultural and religious significance without the scope of your own personal cultural and religious values helps achieve an understanding of the art and architecture produced within the culture.</p>
<p>Overarching artistic traditions of the Ancient Americas exhibit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shamanism</li>
<li>unity with the natural world</li>
<li>animal-based media</li>
<li>focus on the spirit as opposed to the appearance of subjects</li>
<li>creation of objects that have a strong function</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>What&#8217;s Blood Got to Do with It?</strong></h5>
<p>Historically, quests to heal the human body have prompted various medical techniques. It was once thought that evil spirits brought on illness and penetrating the skull was the only way to release the spirits and the illness. This transitioned to the sickness being carried in the life force of a body—blood.</p>
<p>The process was simple—bad or sick blood was drained to allow the body to make new or healthy blood. Monks, surgeon barbers, and doctors practiced this by surgery, cutting, or leeches. Today, doctors use <strong>blood transfusions</strong> when someone is injured, or has cancer or organ dysfunctions in which the body cannot produce new blood.</p>

<p><strong>More Than a Representation</strong></p>
<p>Maya sculptures and reliefs found in temples at Yaxchilan feature images of elite men and women performing bloodletting rituals in extravagant clothing instead of images of deities. Images were carved to commemorate these events in limestone and placed at the top of doorways in important buildings like structures 33 and 40. This art was more than a representation—it was intended to transfer life force. It was participatory and active, rather than for passive viewing.</p>

<h5><strong>Reliefs and Visions</strong></h5>
<p>The temples at Yaxchiln have <strong>several lintels with relief</strong> involving Lady Xok, the principal wife and queen of Shield of Jaguar the Great.</p>
<p>In <strong>Lintel 24</strong>, Lady Xok is performing a bloodletting ritual celebrating the birth of a son to one of the ruler’s other wives. While her husband provides torchlight, she is using a barbed cord to pierce her tongue to experience religious visions.</p>
<p>In <strong>Lintel 25</strong>, Lady Xok is alone and experiencing a vision of a warrior emerging from a snake’s mouth with a spear aimed at her. Experiences like Lady Xok’s vision appear very realistic, and there is nothing in the artwork signifying that it is a vision. It is presented as if it is occurring realistically. This is a common trait in Mesoamerican art—to display mythical events in realistic, figural detail. The connection between the spiritual and mythical was very realistic to the Mesoamerican cultures.</p>
<p>Culturally, the <strong>spiritual and mythical</strong> had a direct impact on their lives, and therefore were represented in a realistic fashion. There was a fine line between natural and supernatural.</p>
<p>Both lintels feature elaborate carving as seen on Lady Xok’s robe. The artists commissioned by royals to create these works were experts and often the second sons of royalty. The intended audiences could be gatherings of priests and nobles inside small temples or for calendrical rituals or possibly supernatural, as many pieces were placed in elaborate graves considered to be in the underworld. The common citizen would be allowed to attend ceremonies celebrating significant events, but they were not intended to view the artwork. Each lintel is also an example of <strong>the important role that elite women played in Mayan society.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Religious Shading</strong></h5>
<p>Visions and sacred themes in artwork are not localized to Ancient America but have been exemplified in various art historical periods. The <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> is a monument reflecting Catholic beliefs and incorporates several images from Catholic doctrine. Commissioned for a hospital in Isenheim, Germany that specialized in certain illnesses, it is dedicated to St. Anthony Abbott.</p>
<p>Many believed the painting had the power to heal those who looked upon it. Vivid imagery and use of color depict the cruelty and violence of Christ&#8217;s death on the first panel. His body is distorted, his wounds and blood are clearly visible, and his flesh is sickly green and covered in sores.</p>

<p><strong>Isenheim altarpiece. Matthias Grünewald. c. 1512–1516 C.E. Oil on wood</strong></p>
<p>Both the <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Lintel 24</em></strong> and <strong>25</strong> contain intense images that demonstrate the <strong><em>reality of pain and death</em></strong>. It is evident just from one scene that Lady Xok had inserted a barbed rope through her tongue, clearly showing her stretched flesh. Her blank facial expression displays the trance-like state she was in, and her vision takes on both animal and human form. The lintels show representations of royalty interacting with the gods. <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> and the Lintel 24 and 25 demonstrate not only the religious values of the cultures they were created within, but also their intended supernatural quality. Audiences were intended to interact with the pieces, and looking at them would have had a spiritual impact.</p>
<h5><strong>Unearthing Connections to the Past</strong></h5>
<p>Archaeology helps to identify specific artistic traditions of artworks—especially excavations of the cities and sites predating the European invasion. Unfortunately, many surviving works were not scientifically extracted, affecting the evidence of the work excavated. Art historians rely on hieroglyphs, specifically those of the Mayas and Mexica, to contextualize text and image, historical, and artistic elements for those cultures. Spanish chronicles by invaders, friars, and colonists provide some information about monuments and artistic practices of the last independent indigenous peoples. Ethnographic analogy can also help identify cultural continuities—present traditional practices and religious beliefs may give light to past practices and beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Nose Ornament. Chavín de Huántar.</strong></p>
<p>These methods assist in finding the cultural context when there are no other methods available, by using examples from those who are culturally similar. This can give light to the possible functions of different artworks or architecture.</p>
<p>For example, art of the Ancient Americas contains objects that have a strong function, commonly religious. This can be in combination with animal-based works and demonstration of unity with the natural world. The <strong>Nose Ornament</strong> found at <strong>Chavín de Huántar</strong> is an example of both a religious and animal-based work.</p>
<p>The <strong>elite and royals wore and were buried with symbolic jewelry</strong> to demonstrate connection to deities and religious devotion. This example features two bird-like heads that attached to the ears, along with the central nostril portion.</p>
<p>The Olmecs had a similar practice. They represented their deities in natural forms like animals. By comparing the Chavín to a similar culture like the Olmecs, we can understand the figural representation of deities as animals in their cultural context.</p>
<h5><strong>No Wallflowers Here</strong></h5>
<p>The interaction of art and audiences is also demonstrated in similar cultures, and comparing these cultures gives us insight into the cultural background of this practice. Religious rituals using masks with <strong>animal and mythological representations</strong> were used in Native North America.</p>
<p>Native American tribes, which are culturally like the Ancient Americas, used transformation masks in their healing rituals. This mask is in the shape of an eagle’s head, with ornate painting and detail. The eagle was symbolic of the deities worshiped and was considered a healing animal in Native American cultures. When the wearer pulls the strings, the mask opens, revealing a human face. The human face has bird-like features, including a sharp beak-like nose and flaring nostrils, and when viewed in firelight, represents the transformation from human to eagle form.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pablo Picasso</p></blockquote>
<p>Art historical study enables you to understand art in the light of its cultural and religious significance and not in the scope of your own personal cultural and religious values. In Ancient America, art was figural, realistically represented mythical events, and glorified rulers. It displayed unity with the natural world and connected objects with religious function. Due to European influence, some methods other than archaeology, like ethnographic analogy, assist in finding the cultural context of a piece. Considering these elements will enable unbiased research of cultural analysis and historical research of artworks.</p>
<h4><strong>The Inca&#8217;s New Groove</strong></h4>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Cultural Chairs</strong></h5>
<p>Cultures in Ancient America would build upon and borrow from the previous culture as each culture developed and then weakened. The Maya thrived in the decline of the Olmec, the Teotihuacan in the decline of the Maya, and the Toltec in the decline of the Teotihuacan. The last indigenous group before the Spanish Conquest was the Mexica, or Aztec. The art of each culture influenced that of the succeeding culture. The artworks of the Mexica, for example, reflected that of the Olmec, Teotihuacan, and Toltec.</p>
<p>This is also true in <strong>Andean culture</strong>. The Andean region in South America was home to several cultures that lived in three significantly distinct ecosystems: the dominant Andes Mountains, a narrow desert coast, and the Amazon.</p>
<p>Art of these cultures is <strong>connected to nature</strong>, using, and incorporating natural elements, animal imagery, and plant imagery. The culture practiced artificial mummification, or embalming, of the dead, along with leaving items with the bodies in graves for use in the afterlife. Golden jewelry found in tombs was in natural shapes like birds and other creatures, evidence of both funerary art practices and the connection of natural elements in artworks. The architecture of the Andean region integrated the environment and was a representation of power and social hierarchy within the culture and community.</p>
<h5><strong>Chavín Culture</strong></h5>
<p>One of the oldest cultures, the <strong>Chavín</strong>, was prominent from 900-200 B.C.E. They were a religious culture whose temple at Chavín de Huántar was the destination of religious pilgrimages to experience the <strong><em>Lanzón Stela</em></strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is symbolic of a central figure represented with a feline head and a human body that was worshiped. The temple featured relief sculptures with images of the deities worshiped. Pilgrims would travel long distances in search of religious visions and messages. They would encounter the <strong><em>Lanzón Stela</em></strong> in a series of dark tunnels at the center of the temple. The Chavín culture gave way to cultures such as Nazca, Huari, Chimú, and Chankas.</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that a small tribe called the Inca defeated the Chankas in battle, marking the start of the Inca Empire.</p>

<h5><strong>Birth, Taxes, and Death</strong></h5>
<p>Within the lifespan of five kings, the <strong>Inca</strong> gained control of the west coast of South America, becoming the largest nation in the world at that time, and existed for less than a century.</p>
<p>I<strong>nca</strong> administration was similar to that of the Roman Empire. Although ruling officials changed, local languages and ethnic cultures in the 80 provinces remained intact.</p>
<p>Rulers imposed conformity in religious practices and instituted the <strong>Inca</strong> language, Quechua, as the primary method of communication. Like the Roman Empire, the Inca relocated groups of people within the empire to redistribute uncooperative tribes to loyal areas, while weavers, farmers, stone workers, and artisans were moved to areas where there was a need for their skill set. This contributed to the rapid growth of the Inca Empire and established a complex system of labor taxation. This system required citizens to contribute by providing labor for community-managed lands, for construction needs, for military campaigns, or for textile production.</p>
<p>The goods and services produced were redistributed to the population in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>support of religious needs</li>
<li>support of the emperor, construction, and military campaigns</li>
<li>support of the citizens</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Sweat Shops, the Beginning&#8230;</strong></h5>
<p>The labor taxation system helped produce more than 20,000 miles of roads that encouraged travel and trade and ensured the easy mobility of armies. <strong>Inca textile production</strong> surpassed anything created before the Industrial Revolution, with <strong>thread counts as high as hundreds per inch</strong>.</p>
<p>The dyed woolen cloth of <strong>camelids</strong> was burned in offerings and used as clothing for golden icons—it was highly valued was and was deemed appropriate for the gods. This tunic is the highest-status textile preserved from the Inca Empire. Sixteenth-century illustrations by Guaman Poma de Ayala show Inca rulers in tunics like this one, speculating that it was made for a monarch.</p>

<p><strong>The tunics of All-T&#8217;oqapu tunic. Inka. 1450–1540 C.E. Camelid fiber and cotton.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>toquapus</strong>, or square patterns woven into the fabric, were both decorative and symbols of authority. The patterns and designs on the cloth carried symbolic meaning, including indications of a person’s ethnic identity and social rank. The white-and-black checkerboard with a red V at the top in the <strong>All’T’oqapu</strong> tunic is symbolic of a tiny army uniform, indicating that its wearer was a soldier.</p>
<p>The <strong>All-T’oqapu</strong> tunic has many toquapus that do not follow an overriding pattern. The lack of a specific pattern suggests that the wearer rules over many people. He is both the source of order and above it.</p>
<p>Extensive agricultural terraces helped produce food to support the empire, and monumental architecture functioned as ceremonial and administrative centers. Examples of this architecture include Machu Picchu and Cuzco.</p>
<h5><strong>Machu Picchu</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The City of Machu Picchu</strong> was the royal country estate of the Inca ruler Pachacuti and was utilized by the Inca both as a secret ceremonial city and as a method to institute Incan presence in the area. It resides 9,000 feet above sea level between two high peaks in the Andes Mountains. Looking down on the Urubamba River, the city allowed the Inca to observe and supervise all trade routes and to enforce Incan supervision and influence over the acquired territories.</p>
<p>The resident population was little more than 1,000, and stone buildings occupied terraces around central plazas. It consists of a large temple section as well as palaces, baths, storage rooms, and around 150 houses. Machu Picchu is surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population and watered by natural springs, and it provides an outstanding example of Inca architectural planning. The site of the city is laid out in several zones, including a lower-class residential district and the royalty area.</p>
<p>The City of Machu Picchu was designed with sensitivity to its surroundings.</p>
<p>Buildings were placed specifically so that windows and doors framed views of sacred peaks and landscape. This echoes the shamanistic views of the holiness of nature and exemplifies the instinctive grasp of the harmonious relationship of architecture to the site. The lower-status elite had only one toquapu motif and conformed to rigid design rules.</p>

<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu. </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Inca</strong> were masters of shaping and fitting stone, and they carefully selected stones echoing the shapes of the mountains beyond. This separates the artist from the laborer, as the artist placed emphasis on the harmony of the shapes of the stones. Many of the building blocks weigh 50 tons or more and are precisely sculpted and fitted together without mortar. They feature minimal ornamentation as the Inca sought to display power through the size of the buildings as compared to symbols of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Astronomical Observation</strong></h5>
<p>Ceremonially, <strong>one of Machu Picchu&#8217;s primary functions was an astronomical observatory</strong>, evidenced by the presence of the Intihuatana stone. The large, flat, ornamentation-free stone located near the main square of the city features a projection from the center, which casts a shadow as the sun moves across the sky. It has been shown to be a precise indicator of the date of the two equinoxes on March 21 and September 21, the dates when the sun crosses the equator.</p>
<p><strong>Intihuatana</strong> means “hitching post of the sun” in Quecha, and at these two equinoxes, the sun stands almost directly above the pillar, creating no shadow. It is at this time that the sun is “hitched” to the rock. At these periods, the Incas held ceremonies at the stone in which they &#8220;tied the sun&#8221; to halt its northward movement in the sky.</p>
<p>Intihuatana stones were extremely sacred objects to the Inca people, as they were believed to be the ties of the city to the gods. There were several examples of Intihuatana stones in the Inca Empire, which gives support to the high value of the stones in ceremonies. Shamanic legends tell that when sensitive people touch their forehead to the Intihuatana stone, it opens their vision to the spirit world.</p>
<h5><strong>One city two functions?</strong></h5>
<p>Machu Picchu functioned both politically and religiously. The Incas didn’t have the market cornered on this idea. What about other cultures?</p>

<h5><strong>City of Cusco</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cusco</strong>, the capital of the Inca Empire, was also the symbolic and political center of the Empire. Fifty miles south of Machu Pichu, it served as the home to the ruler and local leaders along with a population of 400,000.</p>
<p><strong>Cusco, which means “naval of the earth,”</strong> was planned in the shape of a puma. This plan was replicated at other sites in the Inca Empire. The puma is significant because it was a symbol of Inca power and the shamanistic reverence of nature. In the city plan, the head of the puma is at the northmost point where the fortress of Sacsahuaman is located. The body is the giant plaza at the center of the town, and the puma’s tail formed by the two rivers that join in the south.</p>

<p><strong>City of Cusco, including Qorikancha (Inka main temple), Santo Domingo (Spanish colonial convent), and Walls at Saqsa Waman (Sacsayhuaman). Central highlands, Peru. Inka. c. 1440 C.E. convent added 1550-1650 C.E. Andesite.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cusco</strong> features the same masonry techniques observed in Machu Picchu. <strong>Stone</strong> was regarded as a special, sacred material. Incas often incorporated living rock as part of a structure. Offerings were made on natural precipices, mountaintops, and other places with untouched stone. This symbiotic relationship enabled buildings to be adapted to natural features and natural features to be incorporated into buildings and cultural events.</p>
<p>Incas used stone to convey political meaning as well as to interact with the spiritual world. The stones, similar to Machu Picchu, were laid without mortar and joined perfectly leaving faint lines of separation between the blocks. The stonemasons accomplished this by sanding and shaping the blocks to fit tightly together.</p>
<p>The <strong>Qorikancha temple</strong> serves as an example of this ancient construction technique mastered by the Inca. Distinguished by the curved surface shown on the front of the building, the Inca originally referred to this site as the <strong>“Temple of the Sun.”</strong> As a temple dedicated to the creator god Viracocha and the gods of the sun, moon, stars, and the elements, the interior of Qorikancha was <strong>coated with sheets of gold, silver, emerald, and life-size statues of silver and gold</strong>. It housed <strong>mummies</strong> of some of the early rulers and was the center of a network of shrines and temples.</p>
<p>The invading Spanish later built the church of Santo Domingo on top of the temple, converting it to fit with their religious customs. They stripped the temple of the gold, silver, jewels, and statues and used different masonry techniques to build the church directly on top of the temple. This was a statement of the disapproval of Inca beliefs and of the European mission to convert the indigenous people to their customs and religious philosophies.</p>

<h4><strong>Native North America</strong></h4>
<p>Ancient American civilizations like the Chavín, Olmec, Maya, Mexica, and Inca grew at an exceptional rate, resulting in densely inhabited agricultural regions until 1534 and the European colonization. But Native North America, the other region in Ancient America, did not have the same vast population.</p>
<p><strong>Native North America includes cultures north of the U.S.-Mexico border from ancient times to the present</strong>. They were primarily hunter-gatherers, though agriculture appeared early in some cases. The indigenous peoples were widespread, unlike those in Ancient America, which had large populations close together.</p>
<p>There are several regional subunits, including the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, and Pueblo, with great variance in religious practices and social organization between the regional groups.</p>

<p>Commonalities were the ideas of harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and ritualistic participation. These shared ideas are represented in artwork that includes geometric patterning, mythical or shamanic figures, and animals.</p>
<p>Artworks were produced in workshops, often with a master training an apprentice. The gender of an artist impacted artistry specialization. Art was produced at the request of a tribal leader, elder, or family member and would be viewed by the tribe in rituals, like in Painted elk hide.</p>
<p>There are vivid images in red, yellow, green, and blue of the tribe performing a Sun Dance ritual. On the outside, warriors riding horses can be seen hunting buffalo. A lack of evidence doesn&#8217;t clarify if these events are occurring at the same time or separately.</p>
<p>Storytelling like this often took place in paintings on hides. Animals were sacred to the indigenous Native Americans, so the use of an elk hide is significant. All animal parts were used to honor the animal. Native American painters would depict important events like battles, buffalo hunts, or ceremonies. These paintings functioned as records for the tribes and would be hung on the wall or worn by one of the warriors or tribal leaders as a tribute to their accomplishments.</p>
<h5><strong>Transformation</strong></h5>
<p>There are varied types of two- and three-dimensional media produced in Native North America. This includes <strong>earthworks, stone and adobe architecture, wood, and bone carving, weaving and basketry, hide painting, ceramics, quillwork, and beadwork</strong>.</p>
<p>Many Native American artworks function as <strong>ritual objects</strong> to wear, carry, or use during special ceremonies in front of large audiences. The more active, or involved, an artwork is, the more it is believed to transfer life force and power. This is evident in Native American tribes&#8217; use of transformation masks with animal and mythological representations in their healing rituals.</p>
<p>The Transformation mask is in the shape of an eagle&#8217;s head, with ornate painting and detail. Painting in dark red, black, white, and green was used to augment and accentuate the basic form on the mask, and this effect was enhanced in firelight. When the mask opens by the wearer pulling strings, a human face is revealed.</p>
<p>The human face has bird-like features, including a sharp beak-like nose and flaring nostrils, and when viewed in firelight, represents the transformation from human to eagle form and a blending of those two forms. The representation of the eagle is especially significant, as it is considered a healing animal with supernatural abilities. The transformation is important as it demonstrates the oneness and harmony with nature.</p>

<p>The European exploration and settlement of North, Central, and South America had a <strong>significant impact on the indigenous cultures, artwork, and architecture</strong>. When the Spanish conquerors entered the Mexica Empire and Tenochtitlan, they were amazed at the richness and beauty of the land. However, when they observed the priests during bloodletting rituals, idol worship and covered in blood, they regarded the culture as a repulsive cult. They destroyed the religious symbols and illustrated books, and tore down images of deities. Missionaries suppressed local beliefs and practices and worked to spread Christianity throughout the Americas.</p>
<p>In the Incan Empire, smallpox killed much of the population, including the emperor. Treasures like the Maize cobs that adorned an ornamental garden outside the Coricancha were taken back to Spain and melted down. The Coricancha itself was stripped of its riches, consecrated as a Christian building, and the church of Santo Domingo built on top of it. These actions have made stratigraphic archaeology impossible, and archaeologists must rely on written ethnohistoric documents to help give cultural context to artworks.</p>
<p>In Native North America, experts believe that almost 90 percent of the indigenous population died from illnesses introduced by Europeans.</p>
<p>Many groups traded war prisoners as slaves, and the <strong>introduction of European materials influenced how the indigenous cultures lived and the artwork they produced.</strong> European influence affected the content and materials of the Native North Americans to the point that what is now considered traditional is constantly changing.</p>
<p>The Spanish-introduced horse has become a cultural and artistic icon along with the indigenous buffalo; raven and bear and imported materials are now considered traditional. Archaeologists must rely on alternative sources of information for Native North American art, including oral and written tribal history, written ethnohistoric documents, modern artists&#8217; accounts and interviews, and museum records. Historical sources may be inaccurate depending on whether native or European sources are used.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross-Cultural Fertilization</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Bandolier bag</em></strong> represents art produced after European influence in the Native North American cultures. Previously known as hunter bags and used by men, these bags were made of leather, embellished with quillwork, and used for various hunting and farming needs. With the introduction of <strong>imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon</strong>, the materials for the bandolier bags transitioned to cloth and glass beads.</p>
<p><strong>Beadwork</strong> was learned from European settlers and initially mimicked the patterns and colors of quillwork. Quillwork was eventually replaced, and the beadwork incorporated European designs.</p>
<p>As the bandolier bags evolved, they were no longer serving the original function and were worn by the men in celebrations. The <strong><em>Bandolier bag&#8217;s</em></strong> strap features white, red, and turquoise swirl patterns on a black background with gold trim. The bag itself features a pink, white, and turquoise floral pattern, a reproduction of the European designs brought with the colonists. These pieces became symbols of achievement for the women who produced them.</p>
<p>Some Native North American techniques have been untouched by European influence. <strong>Pottery making</strong> in Native North America arose from a need for weather-resistant storage vessels. Traditionally in the Pueblo culture, women were in charge of the home and family, and therefore pottery was viewed as a female&#8217;s occupation.</p>
<p>As time progressed, pottery evolved and the potters began to add creative touches to their pots, transforming them into a dominant art form among the culture. In the 1880s, <strong>Pueblo pottery</strong> began to spread throughout the Southwest with the introduction of the railroad in Pueblo homelands. Trading posts were established near reservations, and tourists and collectors visited to buy Pueblo pottery. Many female potters began to sign their pieces in the 1920s.</p>

<p><strong>Black-on-black ceramic vessel. Maria Martínez and Julian Martínez, Tewa, Puebloan, San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico. c. mid-20th century C.E. Blackware ceramic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maria Montoya Martinez (1887–1980)</strong> was from a Pueblo village 20 miles northwest of Santa Fe. There was no need for traditional Pueblo pottery techniques in the early 1900s—it was not functional in day-to-day lives. With these techniques being lost, Martinez tried different techniques in order to help preserve the cultural art.</p>
<p>The Black-on-black ceramic vessel is crafted in the same manner that Pueblo craftspeople have used since the foundation of their pottery tradition. The pots are hand-coiled, not made on a pottery wheel. Martinez crafted the clay vessels, while her husband, Julian, provided their decoration. While some may say they collaborated equally, Maria received the majority of the credit for their work, reflecting the matriarchal associations with pottery making in their culture.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></p>
<p>The Native North American cultures developed alongside those of Mesoamerican and the Andean region but were less densely populated. The regional tribes, including the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, and Pueblo. They shared ideals of harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and ritualistic participation.</p>
<p>These shared ideals resulted in geometric patterning, mythical or shamanic figures, and animals in the artwork. The European exploration and settlement of North, Central, and South America had a significant impact on the indigenous cultures, artwork, and architecture. In spite of this, there are Native Americans today who maintain their cultural identity and uphold modern versions of ancient traditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>BAROQUE ART RELIGIOUS REFORM</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Baroque art</strong> is rooted in the controversy launched by the Protestant Reformation that began in Germany in 1517 C.E. The various kingdoms and city-states of Italy, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and France remained devoutly Catholic. Wars fought in the name of religion were wars of political empire as much as spiritual conviction.</p>
<p>Two major developments rooted in the Protestant Reformation shaped the evolution of art in the 17th century.</p>
<h5><strong>Religious:</strong></h5>
<p>Pope Paul III convened the Council of Trent in the hope of resolving conflicts and bringing Protestant sects back into the Catholic fold in 1545 C.E. It met periodically until its conclusion during the reign of Pope Pius IV. The Catholic doctrine and decrees on the communication of theology revitalized the Catholic Church throughout Europe. The schism between the Catholic Church in Rome and the Protestant sects proved permanent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2518" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Portait-of-Pope-Paul-III.jpg?resize=424%2C529&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="424" height="529" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Portait-of-Pope-Paul-III.jpg?w=304&amp;ssl=1 304w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Portait-of-Pope-Paul-III.jpg?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1 241w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Portrait of Pope Paul III.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Political:</strong></h5>
<p>Decades of strife concluded with treaties that largely tied religious observance to national boundaries and secular government. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 C.E. provided a temporary resolution to conflict in the remains of the Holy Roman Empire, establishing that, in any given territory, rulers could choose either Catholicism or Protestantism, and the religion of the head of state would be the religion observed by the citizens. In certain larger cities, such as Cologne, Strasbourg, and Frankfurt, residents enjoyed religious freedom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2519" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=613%2C738&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="613" height="738" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=850%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 850w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1 249w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=768%2C926&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=1274%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1274w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?w=1369&amp;ssl=1 1369w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Repentant Peter</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wait, aren’t those basically the same?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but remember that there wasn’t really a separation of church and state until much later, and in some places not at all. So, if there was a shift in religion, it impacted the political landscape, and vice versa.</p>
<h5><strong>Baroque—The Religious Side</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Realism was a prominent feature of Baroque art</strong>, built on the rationalism of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Realism was a basic tenet of the program laid out for the arts by the Catholic Counter-Reformation. During the Renaissance, naturalistic form supported theological doctrine through images and sensations that people could recognize and identify with. This naturalism represented supreme rational order, the divine perfections of God&#8217;s universe, and rejected the sensational and arcane effects of the Mannerists.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church argued that art should provide Christians a way to get closer to God, sharing the pains and sorrows of life to achieve salvation through suffering. The decree of the Council of Trent dictated requirements for producing images of veneration</p>
<ul>
<li>Depict true or biblical events, not false or mythical stories.</li>
<li>Be sedate in presentation, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the experience.</li>
<li>Be lifelike, enabling the worshipper to feel present at the event portrayed.</li>
<li>Through emotional and expressive qualities, inspire not just devotion from the worshipper but the desire to emulate the spirituality and sacrifices portrayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decree represented the polar opposite to the Protestant understanding of prayer and communion, and following the saints was perceived by Protestants as idolatry forbidden by the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>The Counter-Reformation evolved into an aggressive propaganda campaign to combat heresy, proclaim the supremacy of the Catholic faith, and incite Protestants to return to the fold.</p>
<p>That won’t work.</p>
<p>The Council of Trent dictated guidelines about images that could be venerated. Compare the guidelines with <strong><em>Madonna dal collo lungo</em></strong>. Did Parmigianino follow the rules?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2520" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Madonna-dal-collo-lungo.jpg?resize=437%2C705&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="437" height="705" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Madonna-dal-collo-lungo.jpg?w=264&amp;ssl=1 264w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Madonna-dal-collo-lungo.jpg?resize=186%2C300&amp;ssl=1 186w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Madonna with the Long Neck. Parmigianino. ca. 1535-1540 C.E. Oil on wood.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depict true or biblical events, not false or mythical stories.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Technicality here. We’re sure Mary sat and held Jesus, but this is not exactly an event, just assumption.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be sedate in presentation, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the experience.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There isn’t really any spiritual nature exemplified here, but an example of the adoration of Mary and Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Be lifelike, enabling the worshipper to feel present at the event portrayed.</strong></p>
<p>Mary’s long neck and Jesus’s long body look distorted and not life like at all, and we won’t even get into the small man in the lower right corner.</p>
<p><strong>Through emotional and expressive qualities, inspire not just devotion from the worshipper but the desire to emulate the spirituality and sacrifices portrayed.</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t an emotional aspect to this painting, the artists intended to inspire worship in the gracefulness and elegance of Mary.</p>
<h5><strong>If It’s Not Baroque, Don’t Fix It</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Baroque art had a high degree of naturalism and dynamic, emotive theatricality.</strong></p>
<p>There were <strong>two principal paths</strong> followed by Baroque artists:</p>
<ol>
<li>naturalistic and anti-Classical style</li>
<li>idealistic and classically inspired</li>
</ol>
<p>The art of <strong>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</strong> was highly anti-Classical style and naturalistic. Trained in Milan, <strong>Caravaggio</strong> was greatly influenced by the realism of Northern Italian painters (who drew from Leonardo) and their early experiments in the genre of still life.</p>
<p><strong>Caravaggio’s</strong> exposure to the religious fervor of the Counter-Reformation incited him to make Christian, specifically Catholic, history and doctrine accessible, understandable, and meaningful to all viewers through his work. His direct presentation, dramatic poses and expressions, and use of <strong>chiaroscuro</strong> made his works appear performed rather than painted with non-idealized, common people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2521" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversion-of-St.-Paul.jpg?resize=547%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="547" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversion-of-St.-Paul.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversion-of-St.-Paul.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The Conversion of Saint Paul</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Conversion and religious revelation dominated Counter-Reformation themes, reinforcing notions of the spiritual supremacy of Catholicism.</p>
<p><strong>Caravaggio&#8217;s pronounced chiaroscuro</strong> enhances the religious message of the <strong><em>Calling of Saint Matthew</em></strong>, representing the light of divine revelation. The painting depicts Jesus, in deep shadow on the far right, calling Matthew the tax collector to join his disciples. Set in a commonplace tavern, the nondescript dark background emphasizes the mundane, foul existence Matthew had previously led. The viewpoint is the empty space at the table opposite Matthew, which visually integrates the viewer into the composition as equal witnesses and participants in his conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-994" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/85-Calling-of-Saint-Mathew.jpg?resize=594%2C559&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="594" height="559" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/85-Calling-of-Saint-Mathew.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/85-Calling-of-Saint-Mathew.jpg?resize=300%2C282&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Calling of Saint Matthew</em>. Caravaggio. c. 1597–1601 C.E. Oil on canvas</strong></p>
<p>Jesus himself is barely visible with a thin halo, reaching out to point at Matthew in a manner imitating Michelangelo&#8217;s <strong><em>Creation of Adam</em></strong>. A single beam of light emanates from an unspecified source above Christ&#8217;s head and falls on Matthew, who points at himself in astonishment.</p>
<p>This beam of light makes it obvious that Matthew is being called into the Lord&#8217;s service with expressive clarity, making the painting&#8217;s intention readable to anyone. Just as Adam receives the spark of life from the finger of God, Matthew receives the light of divine inspiration from Christ and begins a new life as an apostle</p>
<h5><strong>Ecstasy, Not Pain</strong></h5>
<p>The same naturalism and theatrical characteristics seen in Caravaggio’s works are found in Gianlorenzo Bernini’s <strong><em>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</em></strong>. Bernini refused to limit the work to a rigidly defined spatial setting; instead, it spills over the boundaries of the niche in the <strong>Cornaro Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria</strong> to integrate the viewer into the saint’s vision.</p>
<p><strong>Bernini combines sculpture, architecture, and painting</strong> to transform the chapel into a stage set complete with theater boxes—typical of the Baroque period. <strong>Bernini&#8217;s subject, the Spanish nun Teresa of Avila</strong>, was selected by its patron, Cardinal Federico Cornaro, to replace a previous statue of the <em>Ecstasy of St. Paul</em>. Characteristic of Baroque’s images of religious inspiration, Bernini depicts a vision Teresa of Avila had: an angel piercing her body with an arrow, bringing her into a painful but ecstatic communion with God.</p>
<p><strong>Bernini</strong> visualizes her experience as a metaphor for Divine Love, with the cherub replacing the fearsome angel of fire, smiling sweetly and adoringly at the swooning saint. Earlier representations of Saint Teresa’s vision depict her kneeling. Here Bernini shows her collapsed backward in an expressive and emotional fashion. Framed by columns beneath a pediment and above the altar, Teresa appears like a vision herself, floating on a bank of clouds that is cleverly supported on a hidden pedestal.</p>

<p><strong>Detail: Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</strong></p>
<p><strong>Like Caravaggio’s conversion painting, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa incorporates light as a metaphor for spiritual revelation</strong>.</p>
<p>The gilded rays beaming down from above reflect natural light from a concealed window above the cornice on the back wall, a clever theatrical effect that Bernini employed frequently. Depending on the time of day, the light diffusing down the rays would bathe the scene in a heavenly, golden glow or set it to blaze with the spiritual fervor that Teresa describes in her account.</p>
<h5><strong>Evolving Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>The design of religious spaces continued to evolve to accommodate the needs of those who ministered and worshiped in them. Explore how religious spaces evolved from Classical influence into the Baroque era.</p>
<p>Buildings, are they really that different?</p>
<p>The different needs of the practitioners and worshipers delegated the functional use of the religious space. In other words, the building’s designs were adapted for each specific purpose. Compare each floorplan—can you see where the centralized focus of worship is?</p>

<p><strong><em>Il Gesù Plan</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Pantheon</strong></h5>
<p>Hadrian succeeded Trajan and constructed monuments all over the Roman empire, including the Pantheon in Rome. The <strong>Pantheon, which literally means “all gods”,</strong> was a temple dedicated to every major deity, and its structure allowed for a large open space, not inhibited by columns, to accommodate large groups.</p>
<p>Seven niches, representative of the seven planets, surrounded the interior housed statues of the seven gods and goddesses, including Venus and Mars.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-258" style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0625rem;" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Outside.jpg?resize=562%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="562" height="450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Outside.jpg?w=406&amp;ssl=1 406w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Outside.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Pantheon</strong></em></p>
<p>The dome overhead was like a heavenly vault with the oculus resembling the sun. It was originally adorned with bronze stars to resemble other heavenly bodies. The vast space of the dome and changing light from the oculus were meant to inspire religious awe and represent a universal religious hierarchy in keeping with cosmic order.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2528" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?resize=427%2C639&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="427" height="639" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?resize=685%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 685w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?resize=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1 696w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Dome. <em>Pantheon</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Pantheon </strong>resembled a typical temple. Originally an inscription on the architrave stated it was built by “Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, who was consul three times.” Hadrian placed Agrippa’s name on the façade as a remembrance of the consul.</p>
<p>The interior is extremely unconventional. A result of Roman engineering, the dome (one of the largest in antiquity) is mounted on a concrete cylinder. The walls of the dome are thicker and heavier near the base and lighter toward the apex, where the oculus punctured the center.</p>
<p>The oculus is open to the sky, and a drainage system channels any rainwater that enters away from the building. The walls were also thinned using <strong>coffers</strong>, which create a rhythmic pattern over the surface of the ceiling.</p>
<p>The base of the dome is accented with alternating rectangular patterns resembling frames and window-like openings. The walls are covered with marble veneer and are heavily ornamented with repeating squares against circles, accenting the niches where statues of the gods stood. The design of the <strong>Pantheon </strong>may have reflected Hadrian&#8217;s personal involvement and interest in architecture.</p>
<h5><strong>Santa Sabina</strong></h5>
<p>Bishop Peter of Illyria constructed the church of <em>Santa Sabina</em> in Rome around 422 C.E. The basic elements of the Early Christian Basilica are discernible on both the interior and exterior. The nave is lit by clerestory windows and flanked by single side aisles ending in a rounded apse. The exterior is simple brickwork, but the interior is covered with marble veneer. The nave arcade is composed of Corinthian capitals reused from a 2nd century building and was once decorated with scenes from the Bible on the wall above and below the clerestory.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2530" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Santa-Sabina.jpg?resize=665%2C430&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="665" height="430" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Santa-Sabina.jpg?w=665&amp;ssl=1 665w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Santa-Sabina.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>Entering the building, the visitor&#8217;s eye is drawn toward the apse of the church. Projecting into the nave is a high pulpit from which the entire congregation could hear the readings of <strong>Gospels</strong>. Unlike later periods in the Church&#8217;s history, Early Christian places of worship do not make a great distinction between the placement of the clergy and the laity. Instead, the architecture of the church is designed for interaction between the two groups</p>

<h5><strong><em>Il Gesù</em></strong></h5>
<p>The Jesuits were the pope’s vital partners in the pursuit to reassert the supremacy of the Catholic Church and needed a church to appropriate their distinction as a major participant in the Counter-Reformation. The mother church of the Jesuit order, <strong><em>Il Gesù</em></strong>, was originally commissioned to Michelangelo. When Michelangelo was late in providing the plans, the Jesuits then requested Giacomo Da Vignola to design the ground plan and Giacomo Della Porta to create the façade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2532" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Il-Gesu.jpg?resize=601%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="601" height="467" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Il-Gesu.jpg?w=601&amp;ssl=1 601w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Il-Gesu.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Il Gesù’s</em></strong> plan represents a transition: the nave takes on the main volume of space and the structure becomes a great hall with side chapels, while the dome emphasizes the approach to the altar. In comparison with plans of similar churches, like <strong><em>San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane</em></strong>, the opening of the building into a large hall provides a theatrical setting and ritual efficiency and accommodates large crowds, combining social and priestly functions.</p>

<h4><strong>Baroque—The Secular Side</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Thirty Years War</strong> involved nearly all of Europe except for Italy and resulted in the political restructuring of Europe. The redrawing of boundaries created new superpowers in France and the Netherlands and prompted new artistic centers, which allowed for wider dissemination of styles across the continent through increased trade and commerce. Although religious art remained a dominant genre, secular subjects gained in popularity.</p>
<p>Economic competition between countries was relentless. Extensive global exploration, spurred by advances in cartography and shipbuilding and the establishment of major trade routes, gave Europeans access to a wide range of goods, including art.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2535" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stille-Life-with-Game-Fowl-Vegetables-and-Fruits.jpg?resize=707%2C547&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="707" height="547" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stille-Life-with-Game-Fowl-Vegetables-and-Fruits.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stille-Life-with-Game-Fowl-Vegetables-and-Fruits.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Still Life with Game Fowl, Vegetables and Fruits</strong></p>
<p>This birthed a commercial art market no longer dominated by the Roman Catholic Church or royal and aristocratic patrons. The mercantile middle class commissioned artworks for their homes and bought pieces ready-made on the open market, evolving artists&#8217; conception and creation of images.</p>
<p>The scientific investigation of the natural world in the Renaissance led to the <strong>Scientific Revolution</strong>—a fundamental transformation of <strong>ideas in physics, astronomy, and biology</strong>. Discoveries by Nicholas Copernicus and Galileo Galilei in the 16th century brought to light the vast scale of the universe and the movement of planets around the sun. Galileo&#8217;s telescope allowed scientists to glimpse the cosmos. Though Copernicus&#8217;s and Galileo&#8217;s ideas were prohibited by the Catholic Church—Galileo was even tried for heresy—they soon spread throughout Europe and even Catholic Italy.</p>
<p>The invention of the microscope turned the lens of scientific inquiry to the smallest elements of the natural world: plants, animals, and microorganisms. This prompted <strong>artists to turn to the natural world for secular subjects</strong>, like still life, landscape, and genre painting—scenes of everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>17th century naturalism was driven by visual and emotional authenticity.</strong></p>
<p>Following scientific interests, which stemmed from Renaissance artists like da Vinci, <strong>psychology, humor, martyrdom, and religious ecstasy were popular themes</strong>. Many <strong>Baroque</strong> works give their subjects a much more <strong>dramatic, immediate, and intimate</strong> presentation than the more coolly rational and balanced images of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Portraiture</strong></h5>
<p>In Northern Europe, both Peter Paul <strong>Rubens and Rembrandt</strong> van Rijn were fascinated by mathematics, natural history, and Classical philosophy and literature. They were sought after as portraitists and cast a lengthy shadow over the subsequent development of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Rubens</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rubens’s</strong> style epitomized the exuberant and sensuous aspects of Baroque painting. Self-taught as a painter, he modeled his style on the Renaissance and antique works of Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto.</p>
<p><strong>Rubens’s </strong>interest in Classical antiquity was annotated in a Latin treatise he wrote, On the Imitation of Statues, “I am convinced that in order to achieve the highest perfection one needs a full understanding of the ancient statues, nay a complete absorption in them.”</p>
<p><strong>Rubens’s</strong> interaction with royalty and aristocracy gave him an understanding of what appealed to the wealthy. One of his royal patrons, Marie de’ Medici, was a member of the famous Italian house and widow of Henry IV. She commissioned Rubens to paint a series of huge canvases remembering and exalting her career. Rubens used mythological and divine representations to elevate Medici and significant moments in her life, giving the impression that it was all divinely appointed.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of Marie de’ Medici</em></strong>, allegorical symbolism is used to conclude that the marriage of Henri IV and Marie de’ Medici was ordained by the gods and a cherished political match. Henri IV is seeing a portrait of his wife for the first time.</p>
<p>He had not met her yet as they were married by proxy. Above is a representation of Zeus and Hera, Greek gods, looking on in approval, as Henri IV seems to be captivated by the painting. The eagle, a symbol for Zeus, and the peacock, a symbol for Hera, confirm this representation.</p>
<p>Behind Henri IV is an allegorical personification of France, which <strong>Rubens</strong> used often in the Marie de’ Medici Cycle to represent French royalty. Cupid holds the painting, while cherubs hold Henri IV’s armor on the ground.</p>

<p><strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of Marie de’ Medici, from the Marie de’ Medici Cycle</em>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Velázquez</strong></h5>
<p>Diego Rodríguez de Silva y <strong>Velázquez</strong> is the towering figure of the <strong>Spanish Baroque</strong>. Except for two extended trips to Italy, he spent almost his entire professional life at the royal court in Madrid.</p>
<p>When he was a young child, Velázquez’s parents, who were of lesser nobility, instilled in him a religious fervor and an emphasis on the importance of a classical education. He received a traditional training in languages and philosophy before becoming a painter. Velázquez’s teacher and eventual father-in-law, Francisco Pacheco, was a respected painter and an expert in the polychromy of statuary. From him, Velázquez acquired the habit of the direct study of nature. Unlike his teacher, Velázquez did not “improve” upon and idealize nature. Instead, he used direct observation as way to make a more truthful image.</p>
<p><strong><em>Las Meninas</em></strong> is an unprecedented image of family and royalty. In placing himself in the stately company, <strong>Velázquez </strong>also offers visible proof of the nobility of art. The viewer sees the child Maria Teresa attended by her maids, tutors, page, caretaker, and dog in the corner—the people who would normally be accompanying the princess. It was customary in royal courts to include individuals with various physical differences, and people with dwarfism usually served as caretakers and playmates for the royal children.</p>
<p>In the shadows at the left, half-hidden by an immense canvas, the painter pauses with paintbrush in hand. The subject of his work are the king and queen, the perceived viewers of this scene.</p>
<p>The princess and her companions are in the room to accompany her parents, to relieve their boredom. In fact, there is a blurry reflection of their faces in the mirror at the back of the room. Or is <strong>Velázquez </strong>painting the princess instead, even though she has her back turned to him?</p>
<p>Velázquez has turned this public representation of the royal family into a picture of the act of looking and of representing. As a picture of nobility, it is also a self-portrait. <strong><em>Las Meninas</em></strong> signifies a new way of thinking in European art, relinquishing portraiture from Classical representations and formality.</p>

<h5><strong>Rembrandt</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rembrandt</strong> van Rijn, the son of a miller and a baker&#8217;s daughter, received an excellent education, attending Latin school and later the University of Leiden. Unlike most Dutch artists, <strong>Rembrandt </strong>painted a wide variety of subjects—portraits, history, mythology, religious narratives, and landscapes.</p>
<p>A prolific self-portraitist, <strong>Rembrandt</strong> represented himself more than a hundred times in drawings, etchings, and paintings.</p>
<p>Self-portraits of famous artists were a kind of currency as gifts for honored guests or people to whom the artist was indebted. Self-portraits enabled<strong> Rembrandt</strong> to explore the effects of light and color, including <strong>tenebrism</strong>, and to experiment with brushwork.</p>
<p>The series constitutes one of the most revealing and honest autobiographies ever made. He recorded every change of fortune and impact of time and emotion with dispassionate truth.</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait with Saskia</em>. Rembrandt van Rijn. 1636 C.E. Etching.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait with Saskia</em></strong> is a portrait of <strong>Rembrandt and his wife</strong>, one of his favorite models, and is the only etching he made of the two of them together. The couple’s representation wearing historical clothing from the 16th century illustrated their relationship and love, not a lifelike representation.</p>
<h5><strong>Le Brun</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Elisabeth Vigee Le Brun</strong> executed over nine hundred works during her lifetime, including history paintings, landscapes, and idealized likenesses of prominent aristocrats, including Marie Antoinette. <strong>One of the most successful women artists</strong>, she was greatly impacted by Peter Paul Rubens, and she made replicas after his Medici cycle and painted two self-portraits under his influence.</p>
<p>Her <strong><em>Self-Portrait</em></strong> emphasizes her skill in her ability to paint fabrics, her monumental composition with an intriguingly turned away canvas, and the freshness and spontaneity of her confident gaze.</p>

<h5><strong>Portraits—Dutch Style</strong></h5>
<p>In the 17th century, <strong>the Netherlands became immensely wealthy from overseas trade</strong>, prompting an increase in portrait commissions. <strong>Dutch Baroque painting is absent of religious themes and rich with genre, landscape, and still-life secular subjects</strong> that frequently encode moral content. Battle, woodland, moonlight, farm, and village scenes were popular and carried moralistic messages that were felt without being obvious. These paintings met the desire of the middle class for a decorative and accessible art that reflected their secular, commercial, pragmatic lives. They also offered a focus for spiritual contemplation in a Protestant culture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2542" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Woman-Holding-a-Balance.-Johannes-Vermeer..jpg?resize=576%2C652&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="652" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Woman-Holding-a-Balance.-Johannes-Vermeer..jpg?w=403&amp;ssl=1 403w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Woman-Holding-a-Balance.-Johannes-Vermeer..jpg?resize=265%2C300&amp;ssl=1 265w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance</em>. Johannes Vermeer.</strong></p>
<p>Jan <strong>Vermeer </strong>made his reputation as a painter of interior scenes, a popular subject among middle-class patrons. Women are the primary occupants of the homes he painted, and they present highly idealized depictions of the social values of Dutch citizens.</p>
<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance</em></strong> depicts a young woman wearing a veil and a fur-trimmed jacket standing in a room in her home.</p>
<p>She is illuminated with light from a window, similar to Caravaggio’s use of light in the <strong><em>Calling of Saint Matthew</em></strong> and symbolizing spiritual enlightenment. She stands before a table on which she has spread out her most precious possessions, which reflect the sunlight. She is holding a balance for weighing gold, but it is empty, odd since they are in perfect balance.</p>
<p>Behind her is a painting of the Last Judgment, in which Christ weighs the souls and is representative of the hidden meaning. The woman holds the scales in balance and contemplates the kind of life she must lead to be judged favorably on judgment day.</p>
<h5><strong>Still LIfe Painting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Still-life painting</strong> is named for the Dutch stilleven, a word coined about 1650 C.E. to describe artful arrangements of flowers, food, and household objects.</p>
<p>Still lifes were often classified by the food and utensils they featured, as exemplified in <strong>Rachel Ruysch’s</strong> <strong><em>Fruit and Insects</em></strong>. <strong>Ruysch</strong> was one of only three Dutch female artists to receive great acclaim during the <strong>Dutch Golden Age</strong> and was referred to as the most celebrated Dutch woman artist of the 17th and 18th centuries. <strong>Ruysch</strong> was successful for nearly 70 years as a specialist in flower paintings and woodland scenes. She was accepted to The Hague&#8217;s Painter&#8217;s Guild in 1701 and several years later was invited to Düsseldorf to work for the duke as a court painter.</p>
<p><strong>Ruysch</strong> came from a distinguished and wealthy background. Her interest in floral subjects probably originated with her father, a famous botanist. As a young woman, she produced numerous still lifes of plants and fruits in a woodland setting. Often these works had a variety of snakes, toads, moths, grasshoppers, and the like, which differentiated her from the many other floral painters of the age.</p>
<p>She connected still life with scientific observation and <strong>vanitas symbolism</strong>. At 15, <strong>Ruysch</strong> was apprenticed to the well-known Dutch flower painter Willem van Aelst. From that point on, she produced various kinds of still lifes, mainly flower pieces and woodland scenes.</p>

<h4><strong>Powerful Architecture, Baroque Style</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Versailles</strong></h5>
<p>Like Nan Madol, the Forbidden City, and Machu Picchu, the <strong>Palace at Versailles</strong> communicates the power and authority of the patron who commissioned it: <strong>Louis XIV</strong>. Not only did the palace exemplify his power, but it was designed to communicate the absolute monarchy. This was accomplished through the massive size and grandeur of the palace and the splendor of the gardens.</p>
<p>Versailles, which had been a comparatively modest retreat, became a small city for the king and his enormous entourage. The palace was only a small part of the larger estate. The gardens closest to the palace were the most intricate, with carefully planned flower beds and trimmed hedges. The gardens grew less elaborate the farther away they were from the palace, probably because they were not visible from the building.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2545" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?resize=975%2C749&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="749" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?resize=768%2C590&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Palace of Versailles</strong></p>
<p>Two large intersecting canals were the largest elements in the estate, and sculptural decoration could be found throughout. There were also hundreds of fountains, which were a luxury. Many fountains would be turned on only when the king approached, signifying his central role in the ceremonial life of the estate. The plan was organized around a series of round focal points that had various paths radiating outward, much like a stylized image of the sun, further exemplifying Louis’s self-connection with Apollo. This provided both order and majesty to the overall design of the gardens.</p>
<p>Versailles illustrated the order and control Louis XIV had over France.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Alhambra</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Alhambra</strong> in Spain was built on a hilltop site of an early Islamic fortress and was the seat of the Nasrids, the last Spanish Muslim dynasty. Christians who conquered the complex during the Conquest of Granada felt the palace represented the embodiment of luxury and chose to preserve its beauty and to commemorate the defeat of Islam.</p>
<p>The complex is almost a half a mile along the crest of a high hill and included government buildings, royal residences, gates, mosques, baths, barracks, stables, workshops, servant’s quarters, and gardens.</p>
<p>The <strong>Court of Lions</strong> was the private retreat of Sultan Muhammad V and is divided into quadrants by cross-axial walkways—a garden form called a chahar bagh. The walkways carry channels that meet at a central marble fountain supported on the backs of twelve stone lions. The Court of Lions is surrounded by an arcade of stucco arches embellished with muqarnas.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hall of the Sisters</strong> was designed as a winter reception hall and music room. The ceiling is designed to provide both excellent acoustics and ornate decoration simulating the heavens.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross-Cultural Fertilization—Baroque Style</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The expeditions from Spain resulted in viceroy territories throughout the Indigenous Americas. This cultural infusion resulted in art and architecture that reflected European influence. Explore different artworks from Spanish viceroyalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>The Virgin of Guadalupe</strong></h5>
<p>As Spain colonized the Indigenous Americas, Catholic missionaries insisted on the termination of the indigenous religions. The indigenous peoples were forced to convert to Catholicism and participate in religious practices, including the veneration of saints.</p>
<p>A representation of the Virgin Mary, the Virgin of Guadalupe is found throughout Mexico today in homes, churches, and other everyday areas. The initial image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is believed to be an acheiropoieta and imprinted on Juan Diego’s robe in a spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Several copies have been made, including the <strong><em>Virgin of Guadalupe (Virgen de Guadalupe)</em></strong> by <strong>Miguel González.</strong></p>
<p><strong>González’s </strong>version is inlaid with fragments of shell and created using a technique called <strong>enconchado</strong>.</p>
<p>In the representation, the Virgin is on top of an eagle perched on a cactus, representing Mexico City’s coat of arms. She is surrounded by four round framed images supported by angels and depicting her appearance to Juan Diego, along with the moment Diego revealed the imprint to the Bishop.</p>
<p>The influx of Asian goods to Mexico during the period of colonization affected the artistic production and inspired decorative arts. This is evident in the elaborate shell-inlaid frame that combines floral motifs with symbols of the Virgin.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-553" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/95-Virgin-of-Guadalupe.jpg?resize=621%2C823&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="621" height="823" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe (Virgen de Guadalupe).</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</strong></h5>
<p>The introduction of a culture in colonization impacts the receiving culture in many ways, including intercultural mating. This was captured in <strong>casta paintings</strong>, which document the process of race mixing among the three main groups that inhabited the Spanish colonies: Indian, Spanish, and African.</p>
<p>These paintings are often labeled and attempt to scientifically document interracial procreation. However, casta paintings depict a separation and hierarchy of races, giving the false impression that the more European you are, the more valuable you are.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-554" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/97-Spaniard-and-Indian-Produce-a-Mestizo.jpg?resize=795%2C621&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="795" height="621" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/97-Spaniard-and-Indian-Produce-a-Mestizo.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/97-Spaniard-and-Indian-Produce-a-Mestizo.jpg?resize=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</em>. Attributed to Juan Rodríguez Juárez. c. 1715 C.E. Oil on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>Evidence suggests that these paintings were commissioned by Spanish viceroys and reflect an apprehension of racial mixing.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</em></strong>, a European father is depicted with his indigenous wife, with a servant carrying their child between them. The wife is wearing a traditional garment, but the father is represented wearing French-style European clothing. While this couple looks happy, as time progressed and more casta paintings were produced, interracial procreation was viewed in a negative light through depictions of conflict and poor living conditions.</p>

<h5><strong>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene</em></strong> is the only known work to combine a biombo and the enconchado technique. Depicting a scene from the Great Turkish War, the screen was commissioned by Jose Sarmiento de Valladares, viceroy of New Spain, and likely displayed in a ceremonial stateroom in Mexico’s viceregal palace.</p>
<p>The Siege of Belgrade is on one side of the screen, and a hunting scene was on the back; the screen functioned to separate a portion of the room to give the impression of an intimate sitting room. It is evidence of European themes combined with indigenous techniques.</p>

<h5><strong>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</strong> lived in the Spanish viceroyalty of Mexico and was a prodigy, learning to read and write Latin at the age of three. Although she received many marriage proposals, she chose to pursue intellectual interests and become a nun.</p>
<p>Sor Juana Inés de la was an accomplished writer and supporter of women&#8217;s right to education. She is <strong>depicted by Miguel Cabrera</strong>, after her death, in her habit and seated at a desk in a library in <strong><em>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.</em></strong></p>
<p>Her position at the desk is symbolic of her intellectualism, and her escudo de monja and rosary are symbolic of her religious devotion.</p>
<p>The portrayal as an intellectual and religious woman is significant, as often nuns are represented in a passive manner. But Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz looks directly at the viewer while surrounded by symbols of her accomplishments and faith.</p>

<h5><strong>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Master of Calamarca</strong> was a Bolivian artist known for painting angelic representations on the walls of a Catholic church in Calamarca, Bolivia. <strong><em>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei</em></strong> exemplifies several European influences.</p>
<p>The inscription Asiel Timor Dei identifies the angel as Asiel, and timor dei means “the fear of God” in Latin. Asiel is portrayed wearing a European-looking garment with ballooned sleeves and intricate patterns.</p>
<p>He has a feather plume in his hat and wears traditional European stockings and shoes. The textile with intricate patterns, along with the feathered hat, was a sign in the indigenous Andean culture that the wearer was of high social status. Asiel’s clothing is not specific to one culture, but a merging of the two.</p>
<p>Asiel has the <strong>gender-neutral features associated with angelic representations</strong> in the Catholic Church, and the gun is a significant symbol of the Counter-Reformation efforts of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p><strong><em>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei</em>. Master of Calamarca (La Paz School). c. 17th century C.E. Oil on canvas.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The Counter-Reformation was associated with the military, believers and angels were considered the army of God. Guns came to represent the Spaniards and were possibly considered supernatural by the indigenous cultures, as they had not seen them before the Spanish conquests.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The Catholic Church responded to the Protestant Reformation with the Counter-Reformation, which through the Council of Trent provided a list of requirements that artists should meet in producing images of veneration.</p>
<p><strong>Baroque art was naturalistic, theatrical, and used chiaroscuro to enhance the emotional impact of an artwork.</strong> The design of <strong>religious spaces</strong> continued to evolve to accommodate the needs of those who ministered and worshiped in them. <strong>Secular demands for artworks</strong> included portraiture, landscapes, and still lifes. <strong>Architecture displayed power and authority</strong> not only through palaces, but through complexes and gardens. Indigenous art of the Spanish viceroyalties demonstrated European traits in cross-cultural fertilization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>NORTHERN ART and EMOTIONAL IMPACT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Northern European art</strong> is perceived as a regional variation on Italian Renaissance themes. However, a different economy and social structure in the North provided fertile ground for religious change. This change resulted in art that was highly emotional and was created to evoke a response from the viewer.</p>
<p>Matthias Grünewald&#8217;s <strong>Isenheim Altarpiece</strong> was produced for the chapel of a hospital in Isenheim dedicated to <strong>St. Anthony Abbott, the patron saint of sufferers of skin diseases</strong>. The hospital specialized in the care of patients with illnesses including the plague, leprosy, and ergotism. Many believed the painting had the power to heal those who looked upon it.</p>
<p>Depending on the position of the multiple sets of wings, the images express themes of dire illness, miraculous healing, the pain suffered by Christ, and the promise of salvation. The work was displayed in a hospital where skin diseases were treated, and it is believed that the grotesquery of the crucifixion scene is meant to reflect on the patients&#8217; conditions and create empathy within viewers as they imagine themselves as one of the patients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2486" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Isenheim-altarpiece.-Matthias-Grunewald.-c.-1512–1516-C.E.-Oil-on.jpg?resize=969%2C737&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="969" height="737" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Isenheim-altarpiece.-Matthias-Grunewald.-c.-1512–1516-C.E.-Oil-on.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Isenheim-altarpiece.-Matthias-Grunewald.-c.-1512–1516-C.E.-Oil-on.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Isenheim altarpiece. Matthias Grünewald. c. 1512–1516 C.E. Oil on wood.</strong></p>
<p>At the center, the <strong>cruelty and violence of Christ&#8217;s death</strong> are conveyed, his body distorted by its own weight as it hangs from the cross. Wounds from the crown of thorns and the whips with which he was beaten cover his body. His flesh is a sickly green and contrasts with the dark red blood. Above the barren landscape, the sky is black and foreboding, further illustrating the sorrow and despair of Christ&#8217;s death as well as <strong>reflecting the cultural tradition of the grotesque in Germanic art</strong>.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>reminiscent of the Late Gothic devotional images like</strong> <strong><em>Röttgen Pietà</em></strong>, and viewers are to contemplate their own suffering, the suffering of others, and the suffering and agony of Christ’s death.</p>
<p>Nothing in the <strong><em>Isenheim altarpiece</em></strong> conveys the ideal form and rational space central to the art of Grünewald&#8217;s Italian contemporaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is larger than the other figures, exemplifying hierarchical scale.</li>
<li>He lacks proportional ratio—his arms and legs are long and distorted.</li>
<li>A landscape is not present; it is barren and lacks perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andrea Mantegna’s <strong><em>San Zeno Triptych</em></strong> portrayal of the Crucifixion displays Jesus in a less emotional and grotesque light.</p>

<p><strong><em>Crucifixion from the Predella of the San Zeno Altarpiece</em>. Andrea Mantegna</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is the same size as the other figures; no hierarchical scale here.</li>
<li>His body lacks many of the deathly features seen in the <strong><em>Isenheim altarpiece.</em></strong></li>
<li>Mantegna uses perspective to demonstrate the depth of the landscape, accenting this with smaller figures in the distance</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Religious Reform</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2471" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Martin-Luther.jpg?resize=561%2C604&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="561" height="604" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Martin Luther. Lucas Cranach the Elder. 1533 C.E.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Martin Luther&#8217;s call for reform of the Roman Catholic Church</strong> in 1517 C.E. led to bitter conflict. Despite constant social unrest, religious convictions remained prominent in art production as <strong>Catholic patrons continued to commission religious subjects</strong> to support Catholic theology. While some artists only created works that demonstrated their personal religious values, <strong>other artists worked for clients who adhered to the opposing faith.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lucas Cranach the Elder</strong> was an artist who was <strong>closely associated with the Protestant Reformation</strong> and with Martin Luther. Cranach used prints on paper to promote Lutheran ideology, and the woodcut <strong>Allegory of Law and Grace</strong> gives visual expression to the doctrinal <strong>differences between Protestantism and Catholicism<em>.</em></strong> The two beliefs are separated by a tree and displayed on each side of the work.</p>
<h5><strong>Allegory of Law and Grace</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2473" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Allegory-of-Law-and-Grace.jpg?resize=990%2C716&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="716" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Allegory-of-Law-and-Grace.jpg?resize=1024%2C741&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Allegory-of-Law-and-Grace.jpg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Allegory-of-Law-and-Grace.jpg?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Allegory-of-Law-and-Grace.jpg?resize=1536%2C1111&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Allegory-of-Law-and-Grace.jpg?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Left Side</strong></h5>
<p>Catholicism is represented by a symbolic representation of judgment day.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus is returning with angels and saints</strong> at the top and raises his left hand in a gesture of damnation. <strong>To the left</strong> is a representation of Adam and Eve at the Tree of Life with a serpent, symbolic of the original sin. <strong>Below,</strong> a skeleton drives off a terrified sinner to a pit of flames and suffering people, representing hell. Moses stands to the side, holding the Ten Commandments, symbols of Old Testament law. This is significant as Luther claimed Catholicism was based on Old Testament law, and that individuals futilely strive to live a good and honorable life in order to attain salvation.</p>
<h5>Right Side</h5>
<p>Symbolic imagery emphasizes the importance of God’s grace as the source of redemption, the emphasis of Protestantism.</p>
<p>To the upper-left, there is an Old Testament scene of the Israelites and the bronze snake, a symbol of Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross. To the right, Jesus is being crucified, and God showers the sinner with streams of blood taking the form of a dove, symbolic of grace. Below, Jesus is seen leaving the tomb in the lower right corner, a symbol of the promise of salvation to all who believe in him. He is walking over a deceased beast, symbolic of Satan and Jesus’s triumph over him in the Second Coming.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Religious Works—Not So Much</strong></h5>
<p>New centers of art production emerged, and the growing wealth of merchants and <strong>the emergence of a true middle class created a source of patronage different from the nobility and the church</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Herman, Paul and Jean de Limbourg, February, from Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, 1413-16, ink on vellum (Musée Condé, Chantilly)</strong></p>
<p>This new market <strong>favored portraits, still life, genre paintings, and landscapes</strong>. These subjects conveyed many of the same moral and spiritual values of earlier religious paintings but avoided the dangers of idolatry condemned by Protestants as inherent in Catholic worship.</p>
<p><strong>Pieter Bruegel the Elder</strong> was the patriarch of a renowned clan of painters. Two of his sons made their own marks in painting, other sons worked primarily as copyists, and his grandsons continued the family business.</p>
<p>Bruegel&#8217;s early works exhibited the influence of an older artist, Hieronymus Bosch. Engraved prints in the style of Bosch were in demand for their creative illustration of religious principles, and Bruegel provided designs for such works early in his career.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em></strong> is believed to belong to a group of paintings describing the months of the year. It is part of a monumental version of the seasonal moments shown in the <em>Très Riches Heures</em> by the Limbourg brothers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-943" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hunters.png?resize=845%2C472&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="845" height="472" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hunters.png?w=543&amp;ssl=1 543w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hunters.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Most scholars see the series as six images, each devoted to two months. There are five known panels from the series, all identical in dimensions. It is unknown whether Bruegel painted <strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em></strong> for a patron or for his own purposes. Scholars believe it to be a representation of the ideal country life (either what it was, or what it should be).</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The ideal life in the 16th century, is what we would consider ideal country life.</p>
<p>Bruegel&#8217;s somber colors are rich and evoke nature&#8217;s infinite variety. Bruegel includes mountains, valleys, trees, and even waterways (although they are frozen).</p>
<p>Although the landscape is cold and dormant, vegetation is still visible from beneath the snow, connecting to the cyclical nature of the calendar and inspiring hope that spring will come.</p>
<p>His composition moves the viewer&#8217;s eye, which alights first on the hunters in the foreground left. Like text on the page of a book, the image unfolds from left to right. The viewpoint is above the hill that overlooks the town, placing the observer on level with the crows that circle through the air and a bird’s eye view.</p>
<p>The details of the panorama become clear in sequence: the eaves of snow-covered roofs, the solitary pedestrian on the bridge, skaters, and finally jagged stone peaks in the distance. All is one in this cold, quiet world.</p>
<p><strong>Humans are in harmony with the seasons as a pure spiritual balance.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Italian Renaissance</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> painted the <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong> for the refectory of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. The realistic and proportional portrayal of Jesus and the Disciples in narrative form and the use of perspective are evidence of Renaissance ideas.</p>

<p><strong><em>Last Supper</em>. Leonardo da Vinci. ca. 1494–1497 C.E. Fresco</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leonardo uses emotion to narrate the story</strong> of the Disciples’ reaction to Jesus’s news, including fear, doubt, protestation, rage, and love. Jesus is further humanized by the elimination of the halo that was common in Byzantine, medieval, and early Renaissance art. Light from the window behind Jesus’s head creates the suggestion of a halo. The absence of light to shade Judas’s face suggests deception. This <strong>contrasting of light and dark is known as chiaroscuro</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Andrea del Castagno</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Andrea del Castagno</strong>, da Vinci’s Florentine contemporary, <strong>painted a fresco of the <em>Last Supper</em></strong> in the church of Sant’Apollonia.</p>
<p>His portrayal features Judas on the opposite side of the table. Perspective is used to designate the length of the room; there is an obvious depth portrayed in the three-dimensional nature of the walls, and the placement of the table and figures on the end in front of the other figures enhance this depth.</p>
<p>The figures are detailed and naturalistic. The composition is balanced, with 5 Disciples on each side of Jesus and John, who is sleeping. Halos are present, in contrast to Leonardo’s <em>Last Supper</em>, but are presented in perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Last Supper. Andrea del Castagno. Florence, Italy. 1445–1450 C.E. Fresco.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Tintoretto</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Tintoretto</strong>, a Venetian Renaissance painter, used extreme perspective and chiaroscuro in his portrayal of the <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong>. The figures are joined by angels and employ dramatic movements in narration. The table is viewed from above and to the left, instead of straight on, as in da Vinci’s <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Foreshortening is seen as the figures in the foreground are larger than those in the back, and servants take up the front center of the work, emphasizing the different perspective. Jesus has a radiating halo around his head, reverting to Byzantine depictions, while the Disciples have a mild glow.</p>

<h5><strong>Michelangelo</strong></h5>
<p>In style and personality, <strong>Leonardo</strong> and <strong>Michelangelo</strong> were at odds. While Leonardo was fascinated by all aspects of the natural world, <strong>Michelangelo</strong> scorned landscapes, perceiving the human body as the basis of narrative and composition.</p>
<p>As an integral part of Pope Julius II’s campaign to reassert the primacy of the papacy, he moved the papal seat to the Vatican, Constantine’s ancient complex, where St. Peter, the apostle and first pope, was buried. <strong>Pope Julius had Michelangelo repaint the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in 1508 C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The chapel was built by, and named for, Pope Sixtus IV, who was also Julius’s uncle. In “completing” a space created by a member of his family, Julius invoked the idea of dynasty, a notion reiterated by much of his patronage as pope. The <strong>Sistine Chapel</strong> was a semiprivate space for the pope to pray and celebrate Mass, and it was also where the conclave of the cardinals met to elect new popes.</p>
<p>Though its walls had already been decorated in the 15th century with frescoes by Botticelli.</p>

<p><strong> The Flood</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Flood</em></strong> narrates the biblical account of Noah and the Flood. Far in the background, the ark is floating on calm seas, but as the figures draw closer, the seas become more tumultuous, and several figures are shown attempting to escape death in the water by climbing to higher lands or boats.</p>
<p>The landscapes are extremely bare, evidence of <strong>Michelangelo’s </strong>disdain for painting landscapes. The tree to the left is bare, and there is no detail in the green land to the left. It appears as rocky outcrops. The figures are portrayed in a classical style, emphasizing musculature and mostly nude, but overlapping with each other in the scene.</p>
<h5><strong>Antiquity, it’s back.</strong></h5>
<p>The figural representations of the <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl</em></strong> and the Virgin Mary have similar idealistic and realistic portrayals, just like in the propagandistic representations of Caesar and Augustus.</p>
<p><strong>Michelangelo’s Delphic Sibyl</strong> is a portrayal of a female seer from antiquity, one of a group who were rumored to have predicted the coming of Christ. Prophets and Sibyls are portrayed sitting on thrones, alternating male and female figures around the perimeter, all of whom prophesied the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>It is notable that the <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl</em></strong> is a representation of the voice of Apollo, a Greek god. This Gentile representation symbolized that Jesus’s birth was not only for the Jewish people, but for all people in the world. The <strong>colors of her clothing, yellow, blue, white, and orange</strong>, are <strong>symbolic of</strong> the basic elements of life: <strong>earth, water, air, and fire</strong>.</p>
<p>Classical and Christian traditions are joined, as was common in High Renaissance works, but no perspective or emotional lighting is used. Michelangelo&#8217;s interest in the human body coincides here with humanist rhetoric and sermons given in the Sistine Chapel at the time, which exhorted both God and the created universe as worthy objects of praise.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Delphic Sibyl and the Flood</strong> are stark contrasts to Leonardo’s <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em>, in which there is a rich landscape and rocks. The figures are presented in a pyramidal grouping. Chiaroscuro reveals the figures, while the background is dark and mysterious. Leonardo employs atmospheric perspective to give the illusion of depth. The peacefulness of the scene in <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em> is very similar to the peacefulness portrayed in <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl</em></strong>, while it is in stark contrast to the chaos that occurs in the Flood.</p>

<h5><strong>Raphael</strong></h5>
<p>While Michelangelo was perched on the scaffolding in the Sistine Chapel, <strong>Raphael</strong> was painting the stanze in Pope Julius II&#8217;s private apartments. The Stanza della Segnatura, Room of the Signature, where the pope signed official documents, functioned as Julius&#8217;s private library, separate from the official Vatican Library. Appropriately for the library of a patron of intellectuals, <strong>Raphael covered each of its walls with an allegory of one of the four branches of knowledge: theology, poetry, law, and philosophy.</strong></p>

<p>On either side of the vanishing point are <strong>Plato and Aristotle</strong>. Metaphysician Plato gestures up toward the “ideal” world of the heavens and holds his text Timaeus, which addresses the relationship between heavenly and earthly bodies. Aristotle, whose moral philosophy derived from the observation of the material world, gestures down to the earth and holds his volume, Ethics, and had a great impact in shaping the early church.</p>
<h5><strong>Ancient Authors</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2502" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ancient-Authors.png?resize=922%2C515&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="922" height="515" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ancient-Authors.png?w=614&amp;ssl=1 614w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ancient-Authors.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Many of these ancient authors are portraits of Renaissance artists</strong>. It was common for artists as distant as the Gothic period to use contemporary faces to represent religious or ancient personages. Here the melding of artist and philosopher shows two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It illustrates the shift in Renaissance thought, elevating art to an intellectual pursuit.</li>
<li>It insinuates a triumph of the humanist desire to recapture the golden age of antiquity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Heraclitus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2503" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heraclitus.png?resize=537%2C634&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="537" height="634" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heraclitus.png?w=366&amp;ssl=1 366w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heraclitus.png?resize=254%2C300&amp;ssl=1 254w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Heraclitus, </strong>the melancholic figure leaning on a marble block, was not part of the original design. He bears the trademark broken nose and buckskin boots of Raphael’s rival, Michelangelo. When the scaffolding in the Sistine Chapel was temporarily taken down in 1510 C.E. and Raphael saw Michelangelo’s frescoes, he added his portrait to the School of Athens in Michelangelo’s own monumental style.</p>
<p>Raphael was known for his ability to imitate the styles of other artists, and this witty out-Michelangelo-ing of Michelangelo has been equally interpreted by scholars as an attempt at flattery and as a painterly thumb to the nose.</p>
<h5><strong>Mannerism—Not as Polite as You Thought</strong></h5>
<p>The works of <strong>High Renaissance artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci</strong> served as a point of departure for the next generation of artists, the Mannerists, or Mannerism. <strong>Mannerists rebelled against the current cultural concept and idealistic classical portrayal and opted to present works as stylized, or mannered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mannerist works are stylized to appear exaggerated or distorted</strong> in comparison to the balanced works of the Renaissance. Such stylizations are interpreted as refined or developed formal elements undertaken for the sake of beauty or refinement itself. They have been related to the sophistication of European courts or seen as a reflection of the religious and social tensions and controversies of the period. Mannerists rebelled against the current cultural concept and distorted classical portrayal.</p>
<h5><strong>Entombment of Christ</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Florentine artist Jacopo da Pontormo was one of the first Mannerists</strong>, whose work <strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong> encapsulated spatial and anatomical distortions to create a weirdly visionary depiction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong> works as part of a larger ensemble of images in the Capponi Chapel in the Church of Santa Felicita in Florence and is a depiction of Christ&#8217;s burial. Christ is the limp form to the left, carried by his grief-stricken followers to his tomb. Women comfort the Virgin Mary, in blue, who watches her son helplessly, her right arm reaching for him.</p>
<p><strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong> uses the characteristic <strong>Mannerist color palette of wild blue and pink</strong>, which stand in contrast to both the Renaissance color palatte of reds, golds, browns, and greens and the tortured expressions of the participants in the narrative.</p>
<p>The scene is a departure from previous depictions of the Entombment. The faces appear not only sorrowful at the events taking place but also psychologically unbalanced. Olive-green shadows create the eerie lighting of the scene.</p>
<p>The spatial setting and structure of the image are unclear, with some figures appearing to float. Mary&#8217;s garments envelop her like a cloud of fabric. The two bearers of Christ strike poses that are ungainly, highlighting both the strangeness of the scene and the painter&#8217;s facility in the handling of anatomy.</p>
<p>The overall composition of the work circulates around the center of the canvas instead of a clear, rational focal point.</p>
<p>The painting goes beyond the requirements of the Entombment narrative to include the painter&#8217;s own distinctive vision. The expression-filled faces, the garish coloring, the contorted figures, the disproportionate anatomy, and the lack of symmetry are all marks of Mannerist art. As compared to Italian Renaissance art, there is a lack of perspective and realism. Mannerists rejected Classicism&#8217;s perfect proportions as soulless, choosing instead to warp reality in search of emotional depth.</p>

<h5><strong>Venetian—More Than Blinds</strong></h5>
<p>Florence developed a rivalry with Venice, and contemporary artists used two terms to distinguish their competing, respective styles: <strong>disegno and colorito</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Disegno</strong></h5>
<p>The principle of <strong>disegno refers to the Central Italian tendency to emphasize composition</strong>. The Florentines prided themselves on rational design, spatial construction, and on the “intellectual” nature of their art.</p>
<h5><strong>Colorito</strong></h5>
<p>Colorito refers to the Venetian penchant for <strong>subtle distinctions of color and light</strong>. Venetian paintings were often characterized as works of subtle poetic beauty, appealing to the eye and the senses.</p>
<p>The Venetian painter Tiziano Vecellio, commonly referred to as <strong>Titian, produced lyrical and poetic secular works, which he described as poesie or favole, poems or fables</strong>, often for patrons outside Venice. Titian preferred subjects of beautiful women and love in the mythological contexts that interested him.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-518" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?resize=876%2C614&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="876" height="614" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Venus of Urbino</em>. Titian. c. 1538 C.E. Oil on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>Titian&#8217;s <strong><em>Venus of Urbino</em></strong> is set in a palace, emphasizing the subject&#8217;s wealth and decorum. Though the typical Venetian sky can be glimpsed through the background window, the painting is situated in the intimate indoor setting of the bedroom. <strong>Titian </strong>was innovative to place a Classical nude in this setting. This is a modern Italian setting, and Titian synthesized Classical and contemporary subjects, which had never been done before.</p>
<p>The woman gazes timidly at the viewer. Roses, traditionally symbols of true love and unabashed sexuality, drop softly from the bouquet in her right hand. <strong>Titian</strong> draws on the Knidos Aphrodite from Greek sculpture, but his Venus is devoid of the attributes the Classical goddess, such as humility; instead, she is unashamedly erotic.</p>
<h5><strong>Speculation</strong></h5>
<p>Speculation over whom Venus represents is dominant. <strong>Titian</strong> sometimes employed <strong>courtesans </strong>as models. The <strong>pair of marriage chests in the background and the dog</strong> at the end of the bed<strong>, symbolizing faithfulness, emphasize the position of the woman as a wife.</strong> However, the dog is asleep, possibly signifying infidelity. As the goddess of fertility as well as love, Venus was often painted in reclining images on the inner lids of marriage chests.</p>
<p>Though the painting was first owned by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, <strong>duke of Urbino</strong>, it is unknown if he commissioned the work or if it was originally intended to be connected to a wedding. Though it is not clear that the woman is supposed to be a portrait of the goddess Venus, brides as far back as antiquity had been linked to the goddess in terms of their shared traits of beauty, sexuality, and fertility. This enables the woman to be a Venus, though she may not be a depiction of the goddess.</p>
<h5><strong>Now, Back to Colorito and Disegno…</strong></h5>
<p>Venetian art was characterized by <strong>colorito</strong>, which had <strong>feminine connotations in contrast to the hard, analytical, and masculine style exemplified by the disegno.</strong></p>
<p>It was appropriate to paint the beauty of a woman in a soft, feminine style, linked to pleasure, emotion, and sensuality. This sums up the quality of Titian’s work as a dual seduction of the viewer through both subject matter and style. This became the model of the reclining nude for later works like <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque </em></strong>and<strong><em> Olympia.</em></strong></p>

<h5><strong>Mexica Redux</strong></h5>
<p>Cultural changes extended beyond Europe during the Renaissance. European exploration and conquests had significant impact on indigenous cultures of the Americas and the Pacific. This resulted in cross-cultural fertilization—European impact on indigenous art, and indigenous impact on European art</p>

<p><strong>Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza. Viceroyalty of New Spain. c. 1541–1542 C.E. Ink and color on paper</strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Codex Mendoza</em> </strong>was commissioned by the first Spanish viceroy of New Spain and narrated the history and customs of the Mexica Empire for Charles V of Spain in the 16th century C.E. Mexica scribes created the schematic representation of Tenochtitlán, but it was later stolen by French pirates who presented it to Francis I.</p>
<p>According to legend, Tenochtitlán’s location was chosen by the sun god Huitzilopochtli, who told the Mexica their wanderings would be over when they saw the mystical sign of an eagle resting on a prickly cactus and eating a snake. In the center of the Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza, you can see the foundation myth of the city—an eagle, a cactus, and a snake.</p>
<p>As in some European maps of the time, which were centered on Jerusalem, the top of the image is east, not north. The small house at the top likely represents the Templo Mayor at the center of Tenochtitlán, as it was considered the center of the universe by the Mexica.</p>
<p>In the triangle to the right, there is a skull rack representing sacrificial victims whose bodies the priests threw down the temple’s steps after cutting out their hearts. Rulers sit with their name-glyphs floating behind them, representing the city’s legendary founders.</p>
<p>The border contains the hieroglyphs for 51 years in the Mexica calendar system. In the lower margin are two Mexica conquests, complete with captives. The depiction of captives as illustrative of power and success had been part of Mesoamerican iconography since the Olmecs. Stylistically, the Mexica inherited many elements from previous Mesoamerican cultures and were intent on continued learning from their past, which is indicated by their extensive archaeological excavations at the nearby ruins of Teotihuacán.</p>
<h5><strong>Turkey- Mimar Sinan</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mimar Sinan</strong>, who converted from Orthodox Christianity to Islam, designed a mosque with the goal of surpassing the greatest achievements of Byzantine architects. He was challenged by <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> and set out to build a mosque higher and grander than <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>. Four slender, pencil-shaped minarets set off the massive dome of the <strong><em>Mosque of Selim II,</em></strong> which surpasses the height of the dome of <strong><em>Hagia Sophia.</em></strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-497" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim.jpg?resize=482%2C629&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="482" height="629" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/84-Mosque-of-Selim.jpg?resize=230%2C300&amp;ssl=1 230w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Sinan designed a unique organization of the interior space. He recessed the mihrab into a deep, semicircular recess that permitted windows to light the space from three sides. This allowed the colored tiled panels on the lower walls to reflect the light. Sinan also designed the dome over an octagon-shaped area, formed by eight massive dome supports and four half-dome corners. This allows for a unified interior space, enhancing the function for large gatherings of worshipers.</p>
<p>Pope Julius II had similar goals in his renovations of <strong>St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican complex</strong>.</p>
<p>Rome once again became the center of spiritual and worldly power in the Catholic world, and the Vatican complex became the symbol of that power. Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderno, with assistance from Michelangelo, to complete the church and provide it with a longer nave and ornate façade. The larger interior would accommodate more pilgrims. The mammoth façade, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini almost 100 years later, and colonnaded square were intended to awe visitors with the power and magnificence of the Catholic Church.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Northern European art</strong> was highly emotional and created to evoke a response from the viewer. Religious convictions remained an important feature of art production of Catholic and Protestant patrons, but demand for secular artwork emerged with a new market for portraits, still lifes, genre paintings, and landscapes. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael created art and architecture that continued in Renaissance ideals. Their works influenced Mannerism, and Venetian artworks competed in style. Exploration and conquests had cross-cultural influence in art and architecture from the Indigenous Americans, the Pacific, and Europe.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at Global Contemporary Art in this two part gallery.</p>
<h3>PART ONE</h3>
<h5><strong>Contemplative Gateways</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>advancement of technology</strong> has impacted the construction, display, documentation, and cross-cultural transmission of art and architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Site-specific artworks</strong> allow viewers to interact with the art while their impermanence creates a time-specific accessibility, prompting the contemplation of the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Digital media</strong> allows viewers to access to the art after it is destroyed or no longer displayed, but the experience of and participation in the work is limited to the time it is displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude</strong>, a husband-and-wife team, began creating <strong>site-specific works</strong> in the 1960s. Their intention was to make the viewer aware of spaces and their aesthetic impact by concealing or reframing familiar environments. Not permanent, their works were installed for three to four weeks and live on only through documentation. Refusing government funding, Christo and Jeanne-Claude financed their projects through advance sales of photographs and preliminary drawings. A repeated aesthetic argument about their work is if the site being visited or the later images of it constitute their art.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2454" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=612%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="612" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gates-5-1.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Christo and Jeanne-Claude developed their concept for <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> in 1979 and were inspired by the human scale, the flow of people walking through the streets of New York, and the tradition of Japanese torii gates. The proposal was initially denied in 1981, but permission was later granted in 2003.</p>

<p>Exhibited from February 12 to February 27, 2005, <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> consisted of 7,503 gates that were 16 feet tall with 6-foot, free-hanging saffron-colored fabric. The artists intended the gates to appear like a golden river becoming visible through the bare branches of the trees in Central Park, emphasizing the organic and serpentine design of the walkways while the rectangular poles reminded the viewer of the grid pattern of the city blocks around the park.</p>

<p><strong><em>The one-legged tori at the Sann</em><em>ō Shrine</em>. Nagasaki, Japan</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> took a form similar to and were <strong>inspired by Japanese torii gates</strong>, which are found at the entrance of Shinto shrines, like the Sannō Shrine, marking the transition from the unsacred to the sacred. In comparison to the <strong><em>Spiral Jetty</em></strong>, whose presentation changed but is still available in some form for viewers to participate in and experience, the presentation of <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> can be seen only through photographs since the exhibition concluded.</p>
<h5><strong>Contemplative Remembrance</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Monuments of remembrance</strong> often took the form of heroic images of the fallen or large, imposing obelisks or columns inspired by triumphal works. Rejecting the precedent of these earlier monuments, <strong>Maya Lin’s design</strong> for the <strong>Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C</strong>., was of a <strong>Minimalist</strong> monument, where the names of the fallen take precedence over representative imagery. This lack of excess embellishment concentrates on remembering rather than representing those who died.</p>
<p>Lin drew on the language of Minimalism to create the memorial, constructing two simple walls of reflective black gabbro stone that meet to make an obtuse angle. Lin cut into the earth to allow visitors to descend along a walkway which, in Minimalist fashion, enables viewers to interact with the work and the terrain. Viewers engage with the names of the deceased, which are inscribed on the wall that rises alongside the walkway.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em>. Washington, D.C., U.S. Maya Lin. 1982 C.E. Granite.</strong></p>
<p>Lin&#8217;s representation is of an open healing wound, symbolizing the continual healing process of the individual and the country.</p>
<p><strong>To create a narrative</strong>, the names of the fallen are recorded in the order in which they died. The act of finding a name and taking in the position of a deceased loved one’s name while seeing one’s own face reflected was intended as an opportunity for viewers to personalize the experience. Here they can reflect on the war and its costs and see themselves within the fallen soldiers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em>. Washington, D.C., U.S. Maya Lin. 1982 C.E. Granite.</strong></p>
<p>Lin’s untraditional design was controversial, in a similar fashion to Rodin’s <strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong> in placement and figural representation. This controversy was compounded after it was revealed that Lin was Asian American. This is ironic, as the monument was intended to remember soldiers who died in the war in Vietnam, a country in Asia. The memorial lacks the figurative ornamentation normally expected in memorials and is submerged in the ground instead of rising vertically.</p>
<h5><strong>Writing on the Wall</strong></h5>
<p>Artworks like Rivera’s <strong><em>Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Park</em></strong> challenge societal restrictions and are commentaries on social injustice. These themes are continued in the <strong>Neo-Expressionist</strong> movement.</p>
<p>Like the German Expressionists of the early 20th century, <strong>Neo-Expressionists portrayed recognizable objects, especially the human figure, in a violent and emotional</strong> way using vivid colors that had been rejected by previous art movements.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong> was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Haitian father and a Puerto Rican mother. His teenage years were marked by trouble, including his parents’ divorce and a car accident that resulted in several injuries.</p>
<p>He ran away from home at the age of 15 and dropped out of high school. His father disinherited him as a result, and he spent the rest of his teen years living on the streets of New York. His earliest involvement with the art world was as a street artist, but he soon moved from graffiti and subway art into a Neo-Expressionist style that sought to translate the images and experiences of black America to a high-art setting and audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2458" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/226-Horn-Players.jpg?resize=510%2C651&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="510" height="651" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em>. Jean-Michel Basquiat. 1983 C.E. Acrylic and oil paintstick on three canvas panels.</strong></p>
<p>Basquiat’s work <strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> celebrates legendary jazz musicians Charlie “Bird” Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Basquiat represents the musicians with fractured figures and boldly colored graffiti-like words on a black background. This is suggestive of the rhythms of jazz music and the excitement of New York City. Horn Players challenged societal restrictions and the definition of art. Using jazz, which originated in African American communities, Basquiat connects societal symbols of black America for high-art audiences, underscoring the significant contributions of African American communities.</p>
<h4><strong>Revival</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The prefix “neo” at the beginning of a word indicates a revival</strong> of or a new form of the word it precedes. In this case, it is both. <strong>Graffiti in Neo-Expressionism</strong> and Basquiat’s work is a revival of Expressionism. It took the social commentary and expressed it with vivid colors in new ways and using graffiti as a platform. This then <strong>elevated graffiti as an art form</strong> and made it more accessible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Untitled</em></strong> is a powerful pictographic landscape in which Basquiat creates a mythical landscape composed of stick-like figures amid mystical symbols and mysterious marks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2460" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?resize=719%2C482&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="719" height="482" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The black male figures wear crowns, a component of his tag as a street artist, representative of their dignity and power.</p>
<p>He arms them with weapons, signifying that dignity and violence are complementary, a suggestion also made in the pictographic works of African tribal artists. Basquiat met Andy Warhol in 1982 and collaborated with him for several years after, resulting in a reciprocal boost to both careers, especially Warhol’s.</p>
<h5><strong>Graffiti</strong></h5>
<p>The use of <strong>graffiti has had a long and symbiotic relationship with degenerative, lowbrow art</strong>. The idea of painting or otherwise altering public property in the way street artists do is problematic in that it is technically illegal and is looked down on. However, the <strong>public and subversive nature of street art is part of its character</strong> and appeals to artists.</p>
<p>Banksy, pseudonym of an anonymous British street artist, exemplifies the degree of public showmanship necessary in the graffiti-art tradition pioneered by Basquiat. Banksy has even been caught on security cameras hanging his own work in the Louvre, which people then believed was supposed to be there.</p>

<p><strong><em>Urban Art</em>. Banksy (pseudonym). Lower 9th Ward, New Orleans, 2008.</strong></p>
<p>In locations throughout the globe, he has created images that express wry political or social commentary; his pseudonym is indicative of his anonymity, despite his fame.</p>
<p>A significant commentary on the high-art view and illegal nature of graffiti—would cave paintings have been considered graffiti?</p>
<p>Banksy did a series of works in New Orleans in 2008 to commemorate the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. He created works on still-abandoned locations, like this filling station, where a flag-waving occupant of a rocking chair has been painted insouciantly below a spray-painted “NO LOITERING” notice. The New Orleans resident, an older man biding his time in his rocking chair, displays the U.S. flag, ironically commenting on the feeling that the federal government forsook New Orleans after Katrina.</p>
<h5><strong>Feminine Identity in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Questions of identity and broader cultural inclusion</strong> led artistic progression, prompting reflection on how artists reappropriate the past in new and innovative works. <strong>Gender roles and female identity in art</strong> characterized these artists’ searches for identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Ana Mendieta</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cuban-born Ana Mendieta labeled</strong> herself an <strong>Earth-Body sculptor</strong>, a type of Environmental artist. <strong><em>Arbol de la Vida (Mud,)</em></strong> part of the Silueta series, involves her body, or a silhouette of her body, photographed with mud, implying a physical and spiritual connection with the land, and expounding the female figure as an aspect of nature.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>impermanent but is documented in photography</strong>. Photographs of her work are displayed in galleries and sold as art.</p>
<p>Mendieta, who was sent to American foster homes as a 13-year-old to escape Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba, said of her Silueta series, &#8220;[I] carried on a dialogue between the landscape and the female body (based on my own silhouette). I believe this has been a direct result of my having been torn from my homeland during my adolescence.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2465" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arbol-de-la-Vida-Mud.jpg?resize=600%2C818&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="818" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Arbol de la Vida (Mud), from the Silueta series. Ana Mendieta. 1973–1977 C.E.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Her work is considered highly feminist by some and autobiographical by others. Violence against women is a common theme in her early works and was expanded to include violence against nature. The earth is compared to a nurturing female figure, like a mother, and the manipulation of the earth is interpreted as violence toward women.</p>
<h5><strong>Miriam Schapiro</strong></h5>
<p>Miriam Schapiro supported the legacy of female artists of the past and incorporated details from their art to reclaim the <strong>traditional “feminine craft” of textile and elevate it to “high art”.</strong></p>
<p>To call attention to the <strong>similarity between quilting and collage</strong>, Schapiro coined the term femmage to describe the fabric collages she created and establish textiles as a legitimate art form.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Conservatory: Portrait of Frida Kahlo</em></strong>, Schapiro inserts her features into an image of Kahlo, signifying Kahlo as a representative of herself and all female artists. She surrounds the figure with images of pots, flowers, and other objects traditionally related to the female form and role around her fictional depiction of Frida Kahlo, who is seated as a goddess in a painting that vaguely resembles one of Kahlo’s own works. Again this underscores Kahlo’s representation of all female artists.</p>

<p><strong>Conservatory: Portrait of Frida Kahlo. Miriam Schapiro. 1988 C.E. Acrylic, collage on canvas.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Faith Ringgold</strong></h5>
<p>A Harlem native, <strong>Faith Ringgold</strong> produced many works that provided sharp <strong>commentary on racial prejudice and gender roles.</strong> Her series <strong><em>The French Collection</em></strong> uses fabric as the predominant material, enabling Ringgold to single out the domestic range primarily associated with women. <strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre </em></strong>is part of a fictional story about an African American artist struggling in 1920s Paris and highlights the bias in treatment of race and gender.</p>
<p>The main character, Willia Marie, is modeled after Ringgold’s mother. The specific moment of <strong><em>Dancing at the Louvre</em></strong> is inspired about an experience Ringgold had with her children when she took them to Paris to see the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>The paintings on the wall in the Louvre are all mothers and children, no men. This is significant as Ringgold is exerting her independence and power as an artist—she can represent who she wants.</p>
<p>Although she is painting a white, European location, she can portray African American females. It is the same idea with the characters dancing. There are no rules against dancing at the Louvre. Ringgold feels that the dancing occurred because the characters could dance, while other characters did not dance because they did not know how. It is not a matter of societal restrictions or boundaries, but of choice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Guerrilla Girls </strong>take a far more sardonic approach to the situation of women in the modern world—specifically how it mirrors their treatment in the past, with little progress. The Guerrilla Girls, formed in New York in 1984, are <strong>a group of anonymous women</strong> who use the names of deceased women artists as pseudonyms and wear gorilla masks as they engage in “guerrilla” war tactics to call attention to inequalities in the art world related to race and sex. This reflects the attack on women resulting in them feeling as if they are at war with oppression.</p>
<p>Very little is known about them. They are <strong>careful to maintain their anonymity</strong>, not disclosing their membership or location due to fear of retaliation from the art world they are part of and attacking their own context to promote change within it. In addition to <strong>promoting equality in art</strong>, the Guerrilla Girls tackle a number of <strong>feminist issues—gender-based discrimination in the workplace, sexual abuse, and human rights.</strong></p>
<p>The group, which is still active, has published five books since 1995. Their actions include performance, public lectures, and the use of fliers and posters, such as the ironic poster, The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist. The propagandistic poster sarcastically lists the advantages women artists have, including “working without the pressure of success,” “seeing your ideas live on in the work of others,” and “not having to undergo the embarrassment of being called a genius.”</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Being a Woman Artist. Guerilla Girls. 1988 C.E. Poster.</strong></p>
<p>Another poster, <strong><em>Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?</em></strong> challenges the high number of nude women as the subjects of art in the Metropolitan Museum, while the number of actual female artists is low. This brings out the issues of the female form as solely a source for male pleasure.</p>

<h5><strong>Not-So-Feminine Identity in Art</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1775" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/236-En-la-Barberia-no-Llora-No-Crying-Allowed-in-the-Barbershop.jpg?resize=640%2C978&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="978" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop).</em> Pepon Osorio. 1994 C.E. Mixed media installation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pepon Osorio’s</strong> installation <em>En la Barberia no se Llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop)</em> addresses the <strong>role of the barbershop in Latino culture</strong> and how it functioned as a rite of passage into Latino Masculinity.</p>
<p>Osorio explores the construction of Latino masculinity, or machismo.</p>
<p>This is especially significant as it brings out the expectations of men, both young and old. Young male volunteers posed in various masculine poses and were videoed, while older men were videoed discussing how machismo had shaped their lives. This emphasizes the lineage and generational connection that are brought out through the barbershop.</p>
<p>A building was <strong>painted to resemble a Puerto Rican barbershop</strong>, and inside, video monitors with no sound presented the Latino male body engaged in physical displays of masculinity like lifting weights or specific walks, while monitors in the windows played continuous videos of men crying. The walls and chair were <strong>decorated in symbols of masculinity</strong> like Latino athletes and entertainers, pushing the viewer to address the cultural expectations of Latino men, where young boys are told not to cry, in a space where the female is not allowed.</p>
<h5><strong>Organic Portrayals</strong></h5>
<p>A Polish sculptor and fiber artist, <strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz</strong> explores the expressive powers of weaving techniques, a mostly feminine art form, in large-scale artworks. Abakanowicz’s sculptures reflect her early life experiences under Nazi rule.</p>
<p>The change, dislocation, devastation, and poverty she experienced is conveyed in a large-scale, anonymous way so that anyone can see himself or herself in the work.</p>
<p>The use of <strong>fiber materials is symbolic for Abakanowicz</strong>—she views fiber as the basic element and building block of the organic world. Her work, Androgyne III, represents the torso, arms, and upper legs of a human body sitting on a wooden, ladder-like bench. It appears as a hollow shell and incomplete from the front, expressing the physical and spiritual condition of humanity and suggesting meditation, submission, and anticipation. The back is fully formed, representing the truth. The use of fiber shows the androgynous nature of the cellular makeup of the human body along with its connection to the earth.</p>
<p>In contrast with Abakanowicz’s <strong><em>Androgyne III</em></strong>, Wangechi Mutu’s <strong><em>Preying Mantra</em></strong>, as seen in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description, portrays the human form camouflaged by nature. The title alludes to the praying mantis, a predator insect that is typically green or brown and utilizes camouflage to allow it to ambush its prey. The adult female praying mantis will often eat her mate just after or during mating. The African female body is portrayed with machine-like features, including a cyborg-like eye and un-humanlike skin that appears to reflect the environment, giving an illusion of oneness with nature portrayed not as connection, but as subversion.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross-Cultural Reaction</strong></h5>
<p>Artists in regions that have been colonized and exploited by Euro-ethnic powers for economic gains are impacted by the resulting cross-cultural fertilization. The resulting <strong>artworks incorporate found objects and comment on the human and environmental costs of the exploitation.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Indigenous Americas</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith</strong> uses visual language to represent her investigation of the experience and assumptions related to Native American culture. <strong><em>Indian, Indio, Indigenous</em></strong> is a collaged work that evokes the mistreatment of both Native Americans and their land. The work is a symbolic landscape full of images that include George Catlin’s images of American Indians, a U.S. map, and pictographs of a bear, coyote, and deer.</p>
<p>These images, which are meant to both educate viewers and be perceived by them through their own experiences, coexist with patches of black and white paint and fabric, slashed and punctuated with red marks and the title phrase in blood-red. The canvas includes phrases &#8220;it takes hard work to keep racism alive&#8221; and &#8220;money is green: it takes precedence over nature”, linking racial discrimination and injustice with misuse of the environment.</p>
<p>Smith’s <strong><em>Trade (Gifts for Trading Land with White People)</em></strong> is a complex multimedia work that combines clippings from Native American newspapers, images chronicling the conquest of Native America by Europeans, and objects like Native American artifacts and contemporary sports memorabilia from teams with American Indian-derived names, including a hat from the Atlanta Braves and Red Man chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>Smith uses paint to comment on the implications of colonization of the Americans by European countries by having the canvas transition to red as the work progresses to the right, symbolizing the deaths of Native Americans in the conquest of the Americas and Mexico.</p>

<h5><strong>The Pacific</strong></h5>
<p>New Zealand artist <strong>Michel Tuffery</strong> comments on how imported product has replaced local Pacific Island foods used in feasts and gift giving in his artwork <strong><em>Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000).</em></strong> The term<strong> pisupo</strong> is used for canned food items in the Pacific, derived from pea-soup-o.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, pisupo has been a demanded food item eaten and gifted at feasts, weddings, funerals, and other special occasions in Samoan society. Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000), a sculpture of a bull made from flattened corned beef tins joined together with rivets, is a comment on how the imported item has become a staple and an integral part of Polynesian customs.</p>

<h5><strong>Africa</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>artist El Anatsui</strong> found the emphasis on Western traditions irrelevant, and Ghana’s own work ignored as he studied art in Kumasi. El Anatsui began to create a large body of work inspired by uli, an Igbo surface design system.</p>
<p>While very concerned with the survival and transmission of inherited traditions, Anatsui began to appropriate cast-off objects found in and around where he lives and using them to create immense wall sculptures that fold and wave like textiles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> is constructed from flattened liquor bottle labels fastened together with copper wire and alludes to the alcohol used as trade for slaves, exemplifying the connection between Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>El Anatsui discusses this: &#8220;Drinks played an important role in the relation between Europe and Africa. While engaging in trade, drinks were among items brought. This is like working with history in a sense. This was a point of contact between two countries.&#8221;</p>

<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Global Contemporary art</strong> is used as social commentary and explores cultural, political, racial, and gender roles, along with exploring cross-cultural impact. Environmental installations and site-specific art enable viewers to interact with artworks, but only for a limited time. Art not only records and represents historical events, but it is used as propaganda to comment on social and cultural injustice to change the current cultural climate.</p>

<h3>GLOBAL CONTEMPORARY ART GALLERY</h3>
<h3>PART TWO</h3>
<h5><strong>Man, Machine, and Global Culture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Digital and video technology media</strong> serve as new vehicles for installation pieces within Contemporary art.</p>
<p><strong>Nam June Paik’s</strong> family immigrated to the United States in 1950 due to the Korean War. His immigration coincided with events causing significant transformation of American culture: the construction of interstate highways, the popularization of television in homes, and the development of the first portable video camera. <strong>Paik pioneered the use of video as a primary medium the 1960s</strong>. Paik’s use of video makes a statement about the importance of television in our culture.</p>
<p>Paik employed <strong>music, performance, and video in many of his early works</strong>, arguing new technology would supersede painting and sculpture.</p>
<p>Paik’s sculptures’ incorporation of television sets playing video images&#8211;as both a modus operandi for his preferred medium and a representation of television’s place in popular culture&#8211; has continued in his body of work. <strong><em>Phiber Optik</em></strong> exemplifies a common theme in Paik’s work, the melding of humanity and technology. A robot-like figure composed of television sets sits astride a motorcycle, combining traditional art with the new art that Paik pioneers. Unifying man and machine, <strong><em>Phiber Optik</em></strong> is a visual representation of one of the first teenage hackers, Mark Abene. <strong><em>Phiber Optik</em></strong> was Abene’s handle and represented his online identity, and the work functions as a symbol of the blending of personas, one real and one digital.</p>
<p>Paik’s site-specific sculpture <strong><em>Electronic Superhighway</em></strong> can be seen in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description. It is a statement about the prevalence and power of the mixed messages transmitted by television in our society and the cultural connection formed by highways.</p>
<p>The work is a neon outline map of the United States set against a wall of several computer-controlled video monitors. This neon references highway scenery and motel signs. Each monitor displays rapidly changing soundtracked images that reflect each state’s culture and history, and in the case of New York, includes viewers in the work by showing their video image as they are viewing it. While Paik dismissed painting as passé, his intention of involving the viewer in the work harks back to da Vinci’s the <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong> and di Bondone’s <strong><em>Lamentation.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Phiber Optik. Nam June Paik. 1995 C.E. Mixed media.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Digital Spirituality</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Bill Viola</em></strong> manipulates video installation and water to explore themes such as birth, death, and spiritual experience through heightened sensory perception and awareness.</p>
<blockquote><p>His use of water can be traced back to a childhood incident where he nearly drowned in a lake, which he described as “the most beautiful world I’ve ever seen in my life… without fear and peaceful.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The Messenger</em></strong> is composed of a large video projection produced for the interior of Durham Cathedral in England, a setting that amplifies the implicit spirituality of the work. A nude male figure slowly emerges from the watery depths, breaks the water&#8217;s surface to draw a deep breath, and sinks back into the dark void. Each time he rises, his breath becomes a forceful primal sound of life that resonates in the space of the cathedral.</p>
<p>Viola’s use of nudity in his works symbolizes the pure state of the soul. Images of submersion and drowning, symbolic of baptism, draw on his own spiritual experience when nearly drowning. The piece is a slow and cyclical meditation on the elemental act of drawing breath, representing the cycle of life and death.</p>
<p>The emergence of the figure from the water resembles rituals of spiritual rebirth found in many religious traditions. While Nam June Paik’s work explores and celebrates the interconnectivity between man and machine, <strong>Viola’s installations use technology to draw the viewer into a rhythmic, trancelike state of transcendence.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>The Messenger</strong></em></p>
<p>Viola uses similar elemental symbolism in <strong><em>The Crossing</em></strong>, a double projection of two videos on opposite sides of a 16-foot screen. One side is a video loop of a man slowly emerging from the background as water starts to fall on him, until it washes him away. This water symbolizes spiritual experience and rebirth. The other side shows that same man appearing and being engulfed in flames. The flames symbolize hell and spiritual experience. Both are set to a soundtrack that challenges perceptions and vision’s impact on them.</p>
<p>While viewers think they hear contrasting sounds of fire and rain, the sound is actually one soundtrack that they perceive differently according to the image they are watching. This emphasizes the concept of perception versus reality, causing a sensory and meditative experience and emphasizing the fine line of redemption in world religions.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Appropriations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cindy Sherman</strong> explores gender, and <strong>the way Western art presents the female body through the “male gaze”.</strong></p>
<p>Her black-and-white photographs, called <strong><em>Untitled Film Stills</em></strong> examine the stereotypical ways women are depicted in film. Taking control of her own image and constructing her own identity, Sherman is the designer, actor, director, and photographer of the series.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Untitled Film Still #15</em></strong>, the subject is a sexy female lead in bobby socks and high heels. She looks wistfully out of the window. Sherman takes the concept of representing women in art and popular culture and interprets it through the film still to show how women adapt and are expected to assume many different roles depending on their circumstances.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2585" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Film-Still-15.-Cindy-Sherman.-1978-C.E.-Gelatin-silver-print..jpg?resize=624%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Film-Still-15.-Cindy-Sherman.-1978-C.E.-Gelatin-silver-print..jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-Film-Still-15.-Cindy-Sherman.-1978-C.E.-Gelatin-silver-print..jpg?resize=234%2C300&amp;ssl=1 234w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Untitled Film Still #15</em>. </strong>Cindy Sherman. 1978 C.E. Gelatin silver print.</p>
<p>Sherman exemplifies both the relationship of male and female and that of contemporary and historical perspectives in her <strong><em>Untitled (#228)</em></strong>, from the History Portraits series, which can be viewed in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description. Here, Sherman portrays Judith from the Apocrypha, a portion of the Catholic Old Testament. Judith was an attractive Jewish widow who devised a strategy to save the city of Bethulia, her home, which was threatened by King Nebuchadnezzar’s Assyrian army under the command of Holofernes. Judith seduced Holofernes while he was drunk and then decapitated him. When the Assyrian soldiers came to storm Bethulia, they retreated when they saw Holofernes’s head.</p>
<p>Sherman worked from the representations in paintings done in the style of Italian, French, and Northern European painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. The story of Judith returning with Holofernes’s head has been represented in works by Sandro Botticellli and Cristofani Allori. Sherman’s Judith has rich tapestries hung behind her, symbolizing the domestic expectations of women. She is clothed in a red robe with a black sash, reminiscent of the clothing represented in Botticelli’s work.</p>
<p>In contrast to the traditional representations of Judith, the graphic nature of the beheading is represented in Sherman’s by the knife and the blood-stained left hand. The head of Holofernes is in her right, represented by a wrinkled, grey, balding mask.</p>
<p><strong>Sherman’s representation of Judith is significant</strong> as she is a historical figure who used her feminine nature and seduction to achieve a goal, exploiting herself. This is a departure from previous representations: The grotesque is representative of female interpretation of the subject as opposed to the male, sexualized version.</p>
<h5><strong>Off With Her Head</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yinka Shonibare</strong> is a British-Nigerian artist who considers himself biracial, being from both England and Nigeria. The artist expresses his frustration with the continual cultural push to classify a person as one race. His works, including <strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)</em></strong>, exemplify this duality and comment on the superficiality of race. Influenced by <strong><em>The Swing</em></strong> by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Shonibare’s representation is a headless mannequin clothed in batik fabrics with African-inspired prints. This portrayal raises both political and cultural questions for the viewer.</p>

<p><strong>The Swing. Jean-Honoré Fragonard. 1767 C.E. Oil on canvas</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Why Headless?</strong></h5>
<p>The headless mannequin is a direct reference to the <strong>French Revolution and use of the guillotine</strong>. The extravagant lifestyle of the monarchy before the Revolution is reflected in Fragonard’s <strong><em>The Swing</em></strong>.  Shonibare is bringing to light the irony of the Rococo style, the extravagant and promiscuous lifestyles of the monarchy, and the consequences thereof.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Why African-inspired Prints?</strong></h5>
<p>The use of batik fabric in the European-inspired dress is symbolic of colonialism and the relationship between Europe and Africa. <strong>Batik fabrics</strong> have inspired international fashion and are associated with West African nations. Worn by millions of Africans today, the brightly colored and patterned fabrics <strong>originally came from Indonesia and were imported by Dutch colonists to Africa</strong>. They are now made by African women and are symbolic of their identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Dreamings in Action</strong></h5>
<p>Artists portray their cultural influence and tradition within their artworks. <strong>Indigenous Australian artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye </strong>was born around 1910 but did not start working artistically until 1977, when <strong>she started working with batik</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1988, she began painting in acrylics on canvas. Her painting <strong><em>Earth’s Creation</em></strong> portrays a traditional narrative of the creation myth and the time of the <strong>Dreamings,</strong> inspired by her cultural life as an Anmatyerre elder.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2590" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Earths-Creation.-Emily-Kame-Kngwarreye.-1994-C.E.-Synthetic-polymer-paint-on-canvas..jpg?resize=805%2C347&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="805" height="347" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Earths-Creation.-Emily-Kame-Kngwarreye.-1994-C.E.-Synthetic-polymer-paint-on-canvas..jpg?w=575&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Earths-Creation.-Emily-Kame-Kngwarreye.-1994-C.E.-Synthetic-polymer-paint-on-canvas..jpg?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Earth’s Creation</em>. Emily Kame Kngwarreye. 1994 C.E. Synthetic polymer paint on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Dreamings were spirit beings who created ceremonies and sacred objects</strong>, or Aboriginal Laws, so they would be remembered and are important in all portions of indigenous life. Native Australian art symbolically links Indigenous Australians with these ancestral spirits. Those who practice this traditional religion believe that they are descended from the spirit beings and associate themselves with specific places related to the ancestors&#8217; stories and transformations.</p>
<p>The elders were responsible for the hierarchal system of training and initiation in which the knowledge of the sacred Dreaming stories are presented to individuals in stages over a lifetime. Kngwarreye was a lifelong custodian of the women&#8217;s Dreaming sites in her clan Country, Alhalkere. Kngwarreye believed her Dreaming was the source of the creative power and her knowledge. The dynamic and contrasting qualities of her brushstrokes and colors exemplify the ancestral power of the Dreamings in nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kngwarreye&#8217;s response when asked the meaning of her works, “whole lot, that’s whole lot”, representing her impression of existence through her experience in the Dreamings.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Chaos and Harmony</strong></h5>
<p>In contrast to the culture and tradition portrayed in Kngwarrey’s work, African artist <strong>Julie Mehretu</strong> is entirely removed from African stylistic influences and <strong>seeks to express the search for a new African identity </strong>and its movement, accommodation, and change and represent its convergence with other cultures on the canvas.</p>
<p>Mehretu was born in Ethiopia in 1970 but moved to the U.S. and traveled extensively. The themes of displacement and relocation recurs in much of Mehretu&#8217;s work and not only exemplify her experiences in change and identity, but those of others who were displaced by choice or by force.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1236" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/246-Stadia-II.jpg?resize=717%2C547&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="717" height="547" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/246-Stadia-II.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/246-Stadia-II.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Stadia II</em>. Julie Mehretu. 2004 C.E. Ink and acrylic on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>Many of Mehretu’s works represent places where people congregate and pass through during their lives, symbolizing community. <strong><em>Stadia II</em></strong> is a portrayal of a round stadium with tall walls like the <strong>Colosseum</strong> and overlaid with international emblems, flags, and corporate logos. The drifting background implies a sense of fluctuation and dislocation found in the chaos of the composition. By evoking multiple layers of time, places, and space, Mehretu conveys a sports metaphor in one image that explores competition, advertising, power, war, fanaticism, and media.</p>
<p>By paralleling her image with the <strong>Colosseum</strong>, the place where Roman warriors fought to the death for the entertainment of the people, Mehretu causes the viewer to reflect on nationalism, commercialization, and politics while using duality to represent change and evolution. This solidifies her exemplification of the new African identity.</p>
<h5><strong>Mass-Production</strong></h5>
<p>Not only can art be influenced by tradition and culture, but it can reflect the absurdity of culture.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Koons</strong> was raised in York, Pennsylvania, and studied painting in both Chicago and Maryland. In his <strong><em>Banality</em></strong> series, which shows evidence of the influence of Duchamp and Warhol, <strong>Koons uses kitsch</strong> and elevates the anonymous, cheaply produced objects to a high-art level to combine high art, craftsmanship, and massive scale.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1772" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1772" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1772" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230-Pink-Panther.jpg?resize=459%2C599&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="459" height="599" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230-Pink-Panther.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/230-Pink-Panther.jpg?resize=230%2C300&amp;ssl=1 230w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Pink Panther. Jeff Koons. 1988 C.E. Glazed porcelain.</strong></figcaption></figure>
<p>In <strong><em>Pink Panther</em></strong>, Koons portrays a popular cartoon character in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s in a sexualized position with Jayne Mansfield, an actress, performer, and centerfold model of the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>The sculpture is pastel colored and made of porcelain, giving it a glossy appearance. Koons’s sculpture functions as a commentary on middle-class values, exemplifying the commercialization that begins in childhood with cartoons and materialism of kitsch and continues with sex symbols in film and popular culture.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Koons, simply put, is Duchamp with lots of ostentatious trimmings. This is not a pretty sight. Duchamp’s ready-mades have an almost monastic austerity. Koons has bulked them up, transforming the ultimate insider’s art into the art that will not shut up. For Koons’s supporters, and they are legion, this is an anti-tradition that has become an honorable tradition, with all that implies about the risks and rewards of legitimacy. The art historians, with their addiction to neat chronologies, will tell you that Duchamp begat Rauschenberg and Johns, who begat Warhol, who begat Koons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jed Pearl (American art critic and author)</p></blockquote>
<p>While Koons’s work exemplifies the influence of pop culture, the manipulation of mass production within the artwork of Chinese artist <strong>Ai Weiwei</strong> exemplifies his political activism and philosophies.</p>
<p>Ai Wewei is an outspoken critic of the Communist Party. In January of 2011, the Chinese government razed his studio. His work represents contemporary Chinese engagement both with the art world at large and with the continuing issue of government censorship of the arts in China.</p>
<p><strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds)</em></strong> consists of millions of unique, hand-crafted, porcelain sunflower seeds. Each seed was individually sculpted and painted by specialists working in small-scale workshops in the city of Jingdezhen, China. This is significant as they were mass-produced but unique, which conflicts with the idea of mass production.</p>
<p>The seeds also carry personal associations for Weiwei—they were a common street snack shared by friends and related to Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. During this time, propaganda images depicted Chairman Mao as the sun and the mass of people as sunflowers turning toward him, and individuals were stripped of personal freedom. But for Weiwei, the sharing of sunflower seeds was a gesture of human compassion in a time of uncertainty, poverty, and repression.</p>

<p><strong>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds).</strong></p>
<p>In comparison to Koons’s use of porcelain as kitsch, Weiwei ‘s use of porcelain is significant as it is one of China’s prized exports. The seeds were displayed in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Museum from 2010 to 2011. Each separate seed challenges the readymade concept of the works of Duchamp, Warhol, and Koons and is a commentary on the human condition.</p>
<p>The individual seed is part of artwork and is an artwork to itself.</p>
<p>The works parallels human existence where each is an individual and important, each is also part of something bigger. This also exemplifies Weiwei’s political philosophies as an observation on the reduction of the individual in Communism.</p>
<h5><strong>Nature, Sexual Identity, and Spirituality</strong></h5>
<p>Some artists reflect the influence of culture and tradition, other represent relationships with nature, spiritual yearning, and sexual identity.</p>
<p><strong>Kiki Smith</strong> was trained as an emergency medical technician and draws on her EMT experiences to present the human body not as a poetic expression of the soul but as a fragmented container of organs, flesh, bone, and fluid.</p>
<p>Smith also explores the subjugation of the female body and its erotic interpretation by male artists by using the female’s inner biological systems to represent gender in her art. Her work breaks down the barrier of skin to expose these parts that are usually kept hidden from view and from our own recognition of our real nature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ribs </em></strong>is a rib cage constructed out of terracotta, a delicate material that reiterates the concept of fragility, evoking a shudder from the viewer because it deals so coldly with carnal realities.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Lying with the Wolf</em></strong>, Smith strays from her previous portrayals of the female body and depicts a female nude reclining beside a wolf. The work is one in a series that explores women’s relationships with animals using representations found in visual, literary, and oral histories. The woman is based on the fairy tale character Little Red Riding Hood and Saint Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris who was believed to have had a close relationship with animals and was able to domesticate wolves.</p>
<p>The woman and wolf are depicted as at peace rather than as predator and prey, in an almost sexualized pose. This reflects oneness and union with nature along with a yearning to connect the earthly with the spiritual and embodies the complex relationship of humans with animals.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Racial Divide</strong></h5>
<p>Artists intentionally explore the impact of European colonization and its influences. The art of <strong>Doris Salcedo</strong>, a Columbian-born sculptor, is influenced by her life in Columbia and the impact of European cultures there. <strong><em>Shibboleth</em></strong> is Salcedo’s statement about racism and represents the gap between white Europeans and everyone else.</p>
<p>The word shibboleth is Hebrew in origin and is derived from a story in Judges 12:6 of the Old Testament and Torah. The Gileadites used the pronunciation of the word as a test to identify members of the tribe of Ephraim who were trying to secretly return to their home territory. If they couldn’t say it correctly, they were revealed as Ephraimites and killed. It is now used to mean a custom, principle, or belief that distinguishes a group of people. It is used as a division, a way to exclude those deemed unsuitable.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shibboleth </em></strong>was installed in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Museum. It is a wound-like crack in the floor that extends through the building, starting as a thin line and expanding to almost a foot wide at its widest point. The work is as much about the crack as it is its emphasis on the negative space, the area around the crack. The crack is filled with a steel mesh fence that is symbolic of the barriers used to define boundaries and divisions.</p>
<p>Salcedo said that “it represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. The space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.”</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><em>Shibboleth</em></strong></p>
<h5>What Happens After Postmodern Architecture?</h5>
<p>The fluctuation in architectural styles in modern art is exemplified in the International Style of Villa Savoye, the connection and unity with nature in Fallingwater, the Postmodern complexity of the House in New Castle County, and the innovation of modern skyscrapers like the Seagram Building. Architecture in the 20th century provided interpenetration of the interior and exterior spaces and incorporated new materials and technologies.</p>
<h5><strong>Guggenheim Bilbao Museo</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Guggenheim Bilbao Museo</strong> is notable for its innovative postmodern architectural design<strong>. Frank Gehry, the architect</strong>, designed the Guggenheim to be a collapsing collection of units that is harmonious with the landscape. A combination of irregular asymmetrical and imbalanced forms covered in limestone and titanium gives the building a Space Age character.</p>
<p>At the top is a flower-shaped projection, and a glass-walled atrium in the center allows the infusion of natural light and open views of the landscape. The Guggenheim is an <strong>example of Deconstructivism</strong> in its imbalance, asymmetry, and irregularity, which is reflected in both the exterior and the interior. The organic, sculptural structure also demonstrates the abilities of computer-assisted design with interconnecting, flowing spaces and dynamic curves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1755" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?resize=767%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="767" height="576" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts</strong> was also a result of computer-assisted design. The architect, <strong>Zaha Hadid</strong>, champions the use of pure colors and abstract geometric shapes to express feeling in creative art and harmony with the environment. Her goal is to evince an emotional effect from the viewer through unadorned planes in dynamic arrangements.</p>
<p>The MAXXI is a composition of bending oblong tubes that overlap and intersect, and Hadid paid specific attention to the natural lighting by using thin concrete beams on the ceiling together with glass covering. Many facets of the exterior are reflective due to the glass covering used. Another example of <strong>Deconstructivism</strong>, the building was designed to provide a fluid interior without redundant wall divisions or interruptions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1760" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?resize=831%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="831" height="329" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?w=422&amp;ssl=1 422w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?resize=300%2C119&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Artists like Nam June Paik and Bill Viola manipulated technology, like television and video, to create artworks that exemplify cultural and spiritual connections. Other artists appropriate and re-appropriate artworks to explore and reflect cultural, historical, and gender relationships or as a reaction to cultural influence. Architecture in the 20th century provided interpenetration of the interior and exterior spaces and incorporated new materials and technologies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ART AND INFLUENCE OF RELIGION</h2>
<h4><strong>ICONS OF FAITH</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Petra Redux</strong></h5>
<p>The city of <strong>Petra</strong> was the capital of the <strong>Nabataean Kingdom</strong> until 106 C.E., when Arabia was annexed by Emperor Trajan and absorbed into the Roman Empire. Petra flourished under Roman rule and continued to be the capital of the region. Petra is a unique city that consists of pink hue rock-cut architecture, and its many caves and façades are sculpted from the soft rock on the sides of cliffs.</p>
<p>A commercial city, Petra had experienced a large influx of cultural influence through trade routes and influence from Egyptian, Roman, and Ancient Near Eastern cultures. The<strong><em> Treasury</em></strong> and <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong>, like the <strong><em>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut</em></strong>, are carved in situ in the side of a cliff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-373" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Petra-Tresaury.jpg?resize=624%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="750" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>reek and Roman influence are reflected in relief sculpture and Roman Corinthian-inspired columns used in the façade of the <strong><em>Treasury</em></strong> at Petra. While the façade of the <strong><em>Treasury</em></strong> is inspired by and uses Roman and Classical Greek conventions, the architect intentionally deviates by altering the width of the columns and using the conventions as ornamentation only. The <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong> at Petra has relief images of mythical animals similar to those used in the Babylonian and Persian empires.</p>

<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong> at Petra is a sacred precinct on the southern citadel hill, likely in an effort of the Nabateans to imitate Greek and Roman city centers. The temple is dedicated to the principal deity of Petra, Dushara, who is unique to Petra and paralleled with Zeus after Greek and Roman influence.</p>
<p>As worshipers enter the complex, they are surrounded by triple colonnades on the east and west side planned similarly to the Generic Greek (Peripteral) Temple Plan. Inside the colonnades is a <strong>lower temenos</strong>, which leads to the <strong>forecourt </strong>and the <strong>pronaos.</strong></p>
<p>Petra&#8217;s plan deviates from the traditional Generic Greek (Peripteral) Temple Plan.</p>
<p>Instead of a cells, there is a small theater or bouleuterion. This leads to the possibility that the temple functioned as a large palace and assembly hall.</p>

<h5><strong>Enter Christianity</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The middle of the 3rd century C.E. was an age of great social, economic, and military disarray in the Roman Empire. The reign of each emperor was usually brief. Rome once again regained a semblance of order under the leadership of Diocletian, who was declared emperor in 284 C.E. Diocletian wisely decided to share power with his potential rivals by establishing a <strong>tetrarchy</strong>.</p>
<p>Constantine, one of the junior tetrarchs, disrupted the tetrarchic system by invading Italy and defeating rival tetrarch Maxentius at the battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 C.E. This allowed him to take control of the Western half of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Constantine enacted many military, financial, administrative, and social reforms that strengthened the Western half, including the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E. This edict supported Christians in the Roman Empire, so that they no longer faced persecution. In fact, the emperor and some members of the Roman elite became the Christian church&#8217;s chief supporters and patrons. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to claim conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p>There were already Christians in the 1st century C.E., but art with Christian themes did not emerge until about 190 C.E. and was created during a period of intermittent persecution. This art reflects both the beliefs of the growing Christian communities and their adaptation of existing Roman artistic styles.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Biblical Knowledge</strong></h5>
<p>Art history is a pictorial document of cultural and religious events. It happened, it was illustrated, so now it can be studied to figure out what people used to do, where they came from, and most importantly, why.</p>
<p>To understand many Early Christian works of art, you need some <strong>Biblical knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Christians adopted the Hebrew Bible</strong> as the <strong>Old Testament</strong>, adding a <strong>New Testament</strong> that told of the life of Jesus, the earliest days of the Christian church, and the ultimate triumph of God in the final book of the Bible, Revelation.</p>
<p>Although <strong>Jesus and the earliest disciples were Jewish</strong>, most of his subsequent <strong>followers were gentiles</strong>. They included narratives from both the Hebrew Bible and their own Greco-Roman culture in the earliest Christian art, as various traditions intersect.</p>

<h5><strong>Art, Death, and Catacombs</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Etruscans used elaborate tombs and mausoleums within larger necropoleis to bury their dead, Jews and Christians used catacombs.</strong></p>
<p>The earliest Christian imagery in the Roman catacombs dates from about 200 C.E. The catacombs in Rome were cut out of a soft rock called tufa, and the walls were lined with loculi where bodies might be placed. <strong>Locul</strong>i line the walls in the gallery of the <strong><em>Catacomb of Priscilla</em></strong> in Rome.</p>
<p>The catacombs are believed to be named after the wife of a Roman consul. She converted to Christianity and as a result was sentenced to death. Originally, the loculi would have been covered with plaques inscribed with information about those buried and sometimes with simple drawings.</p>

<h5><strong>The Wealthy</strong></h5>
<p>Wealthier families usually had an entire chamber for their burial space, with marble s<strong>arcophagi</strong> to hold the bodies. Complex narratives were designed for the sarcophagi of wealthy patrons. <strong><em>The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</em></strong> combines the Judeo-Christian narrative with the deceased&#8217;s identity as a member of the Roman senatorial class. The style of the sarcophagus represents a new classicizing trend in the 4th century that departs from the harsh tetrarchic style of the late 3rd century. The front of the sarcophagus is composed of two registers, each subdivided by columns into sections that depict various scenes from the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<h5><strong>Religious Narratives</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Religious narratives </strong>in the catacombs portray more than text could. Common motifs represent significant moments or testaments of the faith of the deceased’s life.</p>
<h5><strong>Good Shepherd</strong></h5>
<p>In many cases, Christians and Jews adopted and adapted imagery from the surrounding Roman culture for their own purposes. The motif of the good shepherd was adapted by Christians from images of shepherds popular in the surrounding Roman culture.</p>
<p>In the catacombs of Christians and in churches, this shepherd image was appropriated to represent Jesus, the &#8220;Good Shepherd&#8221; who gave his life for his sheep.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Orant Figure</strong></h5>
<p>Early Christian artists appropriated the orant figure, who raises hands in prayer, from the Roman culture to represent Christian devotees. The female <strong>orant figure</strong> is positioned between two other representations of her life.</p>
<p>In her marriage to the left and with a child to the right. This centralization of the orant figure emphasizes her conversion as a significant life event, like her marriage and the birth of her children.</p>

<h5><strong>Devine Deliverance</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, painters created simple narrative images drawn from the Christian Old and New Testaments to decorate the catacombs and other settings. Dominant were references to the miracles of Jesus or scenes in which faithful figures experienced <strong>divine deliverance</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, the story of Shadrack, Meshack, and Abednego, found in Daniel 3 of the Old Testament, was popular in this period. They would not bow down before the idol of the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar and were thrown into a fiery furnace as punishment but saved from destruction by God.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2700" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=772%2C544&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="772" height="544" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?w=772&amp;ssl=1 772w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=768%2C541&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Three Youths in the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In this catacomb painting, <strong>the three youths raise their arms in an orant gesture.</strong> Certainly, the theme of avoiding idolatry resonated in a culture full of such idols.</p>
<p>During the 3rd century, Christians found themselves in a position whereby refusing to participate in the imperial cult risked death. This led to the portrayal of deliverance from death. The prayers for the dead often referenced God&#8217;s deliverance of the three Hebrew youths and other figures as a paradigm for the ultimate deliverance of those who were buried in the catacombs.</p>
<h5><strong>Religious Storytelling</strong></h5>
<p>Despite Jesus’s earliest followers being Jewish, Christians interpret events in the Hebrew Bible to have their fullest meaning in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and in the subsequent history of the Christian church. Therefore, events drawn from the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament, are often contextualized and interpreted in Christian contexts as types, or patterns, that foreshadow events in the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>This <strong>typological means</strong> <strong>narratives would be depicted in Jewish and Christian contexts with very different meanings.</strong></p>
<p>The story of the prophet Jonah is shown in Early Christian art in the ceiling decoration of the <strong><em>Catacomb of Petrus and Marcellinus.</em></strong></p>
<p>The ceiling painting, divided by red bands against a white ground, is reminiscent of domestic painting in Rome during this period. The disc in the center is a medallion, and the semicircular areas on the wall below are lunettes.</p>
<p>The<strong><em> Good Shepherd</em></strong> symbolizes Jesus, with the motif of the lambs repeated in the lunettes below. We see three of the four phases from the narrative of Jonah surrounding. Jonah is shown thrown overboard, swallowed by a whale, spit up by the whale after three days in its belly, and finally reclining under a gourd tree.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2701" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Good-Shepard-and-Jonah-Narrative.jpg?resize=805%2C547&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="805" height="547" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Good-Shepard-and-Jonah-Narrative.jpg?w=459&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Good-Shepard-and-Jonah-Narrative.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Good Shepard and Jonah Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Notice that Jonah emerges from the whale spreading his hands in prayer for deliverance in a way that echoes the surrounding orant figures and representations of Jesus as he departs the tomb.</p>
<p>Jesus compared himself to Jonah because he was in the tomb for three days, just as Jonah had been in the whale three days.</p>
<p>A similar mosaic from the <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> is of Justinian I, a Byzantinian emperor, and his attendants. Identifiers of his imperial power are in his clothing. He wears purple with a golden tableion, a richly jeweled crown, and a pendant broach.</p>
<p>Justinian holds the bowl containing the unleavened bread that was used in the Holy Communion and has a halo around his head. Though this is an <strong>important combination of religion and government</strong>, emperors of Constantinople were not considered gods or deified upon their deaths, which was considered idolatry in Christianity, as were emperors in Ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Justinian was not a high priest, as Roman consuls were. The high priest in Constantinople was the archbishop.</p>
<p>Justinian is portrayed as the largest figure, representative of his importance.</p>

<h5><strong>Constantinople Was Byzantium</strong></h5>
<p>The modern-day city of Istanbul, Turkey, was once referred to as Byzantium. It later became consecrated as <strong>Constantinople</strong> in May of 330 C.E. and was named <strong>after the Roman emperor Constantine,</strong> who made it the capitol of the Eastern Empire. Like Rome, it was governed by Roman law, had seven hills, and provided free entertainment and bread to its citizens.</p>
<p>The capital of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire was different from its Western sister-city; everyone spoke Greek, and their holy books and educational systems were in Greek.</p>
<p><strong>Constantinople was a Christian society</strong>. Muslims and Jews existed within its framework, but the emperor, as well as the church&#8217;s patriarch and most of its citizens, were Christian in their faith.</p>

<h5><strong>Byzantine Art </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>art and architecture of Byzantium was dominated by Christianity</strong> and is classified: <strong>early, middle, and late.</strong></p>
<p>There are three major influences in Byzantine art:</p>
<p><strong>Christian:</strong> A concern for spiritual imagery, as opposed to naturalistic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Antique:</strong> Byzantines were proud of their Classical heritage and often looked back to Classical Greece and Rome.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmopolitan:</strong> Constantinople stood on a crossroads between the Christian West and the Islamic East. Persia had great influence on Byzantine art.</p>

<h5><strong>Early Architecture: Hagia Sophia</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, or Church of Holy Wisdom, was the largest church in Christendom for a millennium. It was commissioned by Justinian I between 532 and 537 C.E.</p>
<p>It was built by two architects, Anthemios of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus. They were mathematicians who had never created anything of this scale before.</p>
<p>Completed, Hagia Sophia combines the longitudinal plan of a basilica with the vertical orientation that would eventually characterize most Byzantine churches.</p>

<p><strong>Plan for <em>Hagia Sophia.</em></strong></p>
<p>The use of <strong>numerical arrangements reflected Christian ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 for the Trinity</li>
<li>5 for the wounds of Christ</li>
<li>12 for the Twelve Apostles.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the east and west ends are half-circles, culminating in semi-domes (with five windows), each of which has three smaller semi-domes (with five windows), culminating in three apses. The north and south ends have five arches along the side aisles and seven arches in the galleries above, with 12 windows in the lunettes. The windows themselves are in two rows: one of seven, and one of five.</p>
<p>Early Byzantine churches, like <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, are simple on the outside. However, inside <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, the viewer is transported by the church&#8217;s majesty. Marbles of every color—some shipped from as far as Egypt—form the pillars, walls, and floors. Halls echo with the sound of choirs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hagia Sophia </em></strong>looks very different today than it did in the past. It retains its massive dome, but large buttresses and four minarets were added when the church was <strong>converted to a mosque by the Ottoman Turks</strong> with the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 C.E.</p>
<p>During the day, the 40 windows at the dome&#8217;s base make it look as though it is floating on light. At night, the light of thousands of candles gives the same impression to viewers looking at the dome from the outside.</p>
<p>The builders could incorporate so many windows into the dome because they used <strong>pendentives </strong>to shift the weight from the dome to piers, instead of walls. Because the walls do not support the dome, they could be pierced by many windows.</p>
<p>The use of light provides <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> with an otherworldly, spiritual characteristic of Byzantine art.</p>

<h5><strong>Early Architecture: San Vitale</strong></h5>
<p>The church of <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> was dedicated in the port town of Ravenna a decade after <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> was built in 547 C.E. This is not a Western-style church, despite being in Italy, because Justinian&#8217;s armies had recently reconquered the region.</p>
<p>Like the plan of <strong>Hagia Sophia</strong>, <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> shows two concentric octagons, with the inner one rising above the outer one. In the central space, eight columned arches separate eight piers. The ambulatory and gallery above it are interrupted by a cross-vaulted <strong>chancel</strong> that precedes the apse.</p>
<p>With all this symmetry, the asymmetrical <strong>narthex</strong> is unexpected and gives the church its signature look.</p>
<p>The <strong>sanctuary</strong> is covered with images and symbols that express the idea of Christ&#8217;s redemption of humanity and the reenactment the Lord&#8217;s Supper.</p>
<p>The celebration of Mass occurred on the lower level, and those in attendance witnessed the Mass processional from the upper balconies. This pulled the viewers into the action of the Mass.</p>

<p><em><strong>San Vitale</strong></em></p>
<h5><strong>Mosaics: something old, something new</strong></h5>
<p>Byzantine mosaics have features that are both a continuation of and a break with the ancient Mediterranean world. Mosaics take some characteristics, and they leave some behind. The frame around the mosaic is ancient. Intricate clothing is contemporary.</p>
<h5><strong>Theodora and her Attendants</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>
<p>Frames neatly compartmentalize mosaics with bursts of ornamentation.</p>
<p><strong>Faces</strong></p>
<p>A person depicted in a Byzantine mosaic usually faces front, with staring eyes. While his or her face can be expressive, the features themselves are usually stylized.</p>
<p><strong>Clothes</strong></p>
<p>Much of the complexity of Byzantine mosaics comes from the clothing. Stark, contrasting colors enhance the brilliancy of the drapery.</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>
<p>Byzantine bodies are elongated and generalized, their small, pointed feet dangling as if they float above the ground. They are usually outlined in black, enhancing their stark otherworldliness.</p>
<p><strong>Setting</strong></p>
<p>Mosaic backgrounds are simple, often just a gold field of color.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>
<p>In some Byzantine art, important people are larger and taller than less important people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Still Early Byzantine Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Ornamentation</strong></h5>
<p>For Byzantines, the more expensive the materials, the better the works of art. There was a decrease in large marble statuary and an increase in costly <strong>materials like metal, ivory, and glass</strong> in the early period. The glass industry was driven in part by demand for mosaic pieces, enamel for plating, and individual pieces for imperial court made of blue and purple glass.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of what is left of the famous Byzantine glass industry is shards. There was a decline of three-dimensional art (like sculpture in the round) in favor of two-dimensional art (like mosaics, frescoes, and enamels).</p>

<h5><strong>Representation</strong></h5>
<p>Though life-like portraiture was not popular, much of Byzantine art sought to represent people (and angels) individually. Byzantine artists did this by referring to complex Christian and Classical symbolism along with using straightforward Greek labels.</p>
<p>Byzantine images seek to tell a story, either a well-known one from the Bible, an exploit of an emperor or empress, or the heroic actions of a saint.</p>

<h4><strong>Narration</strong></h4>
<p>The word Byzantine today is synonymous with ornamentation. Byzantines employed many elaborate styles of decoration—an elaborate gold frame around an icon, busy geometric patterns on clothing, or thousands of angels crowding an upper register.</p>
<p>Greek letters are decorative and informative, and repeating motifs of flowers and animals are similar to neighboring Islamic art.</p>

<p><em><strong>Barberini Ivory.</strong></em></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Barberini Ivory</em></strong> was once part of an imperial <strong>diptych</strong> celebrating the military triumph of an emperor and represents an intersection of Classical imagery and Byzantine art. <strong>At the center is the emperor</strong> (possibly Justinian) on a horse. Note that he is larger than everything else and carved in higher relief.</p>
<p>In the same panel, Classical elements include a winged representation of Victory flying beside him and a personification of the fertile Earth beneath him. <strong>To his side and behind him</strong> is a barely visible conquered enemy, likely Muslim. More conquered people bearing gifts make up the <strong>lower register</strong>. In the <strong>left </strong>panel, a general holds a statue of Victory. Above the emperor are winged angels surrounding an image of Christ, who gives sanction to the emperor&#8217;s actions.</p>
<h5><strong>Archangel Michael</strong></h5>

<p><em><strong>Archangel Michael.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em>The<strong> <em>Archangel Michael</em> </strong>comes from an ivory <strong>diptych</strong> of the 6th century C.E. A representation of the Archangel Michael, it uses Classical elements including the <strong>wet drapery technique</strong>, Michael&#8217;s facial expression, and the orb of power he bears in his hand. The orb is surmounted by a Christian cross signifying Christ&#8217;s dominion over Earth. There is a change in perspective: Michael is in front of the pillars from the waist up, but his feet are on the steps behind the pillars.</p>

<h5><strong>Shroud of Charlemagne </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2715" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shroud-of-Charlemagne..jpg?resize=655%2C667&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="655" height="667" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shroud-of-Charlemagne..jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shroud-of-Charlemagne..jpg?resize=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1 294w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Shroud of Charlemagne </strong>is a silken cloth manufactured in Constantinople in 814 C.E. It depicts a large man riding a chariot. Smaller figures are nearby, not touching him. Note the frontal, linear nature of all the figures and the many ornamental circles with their stylized, repeating motifs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Apse Mosaic</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2719" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="722" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>All the figures in the <strong><em>Apse Mosaic and Choir of San Vitale</em></strong> are flat, symbolic, and isolated, lacking three-dimensional representation. There is no overlapping of figures, nor are there natural poses. While Classical, naturalistic poses will make a comeback from time to time in Byzantium, the Byzantine linear form is firmly established, with its focus on spirituality and detail<strong>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Icons and Iconoclasm</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Byzantine art</strong> is characterized by <strong>icons and highly stylized conventions</strong>. The icon <strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong> from the Monastery of St. Catherine portrays Mary, the mother of God <strong>(Theotokos),</strong> enthroned with an infant Christ, flanked by two saints, with angels rising in the background.</p>
<p>An icon like this would be displayed at a church or in smaller form at a private home. All figures are flat and frontal, wearing textured drapery and floating atop small, pointed feet and demonstrate the distinctly Byzantine style.</p>
<p><strong>Early or late, what’s the difference?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, <strong>Early Byzantine</strong> is marked by the <strong>three F&#8217;s—flat, frontal, and floating</strong>. As the period progressed, so did the portrayal of perspective and dimension. If someone is floating, you know what period they belong in.</p>
<p>People soon started spreading rumors about the mystical properties of these spiritual, otherworldly icons. Some icons spoke, cried, or bled. Some were said to be <strong>acheropoietes</strong>.</p>
<p>The Virgin of Vladimir is a middle-period Byzantine icon. She is characteristic of the Byzantine style, evident in the flat gold background, stylized but expressive face, elongated proportions, and ornamentally folded drapery.</p>
<p>Some members of the clergy condemned what they saw as a violation of the second commandment, which bans the use of idols. This influenced Emperor Leo III, who was having a difficult time as Islamic armies kept defeating him. After a major volcanic eruption in 726 C.E. darkened the skies over Constantinople for days, Leo III decided that the hand of God had been withdrawn from his city because icons were being used as idols.</p>
<p>Once Leo III banned icon use, he started to win battles. This began a tradition of <strong>iconoclast</strong> emperors. During this movement, known as <strong>iconoclasm</strong>, church mosaics were painted over with lime and replaced by secular or natural images. Eventually, the widowed Empress Theodora stopped iconoclasm while acting as regent for her son, Michael III, in 843 C.E.</p>

<p><strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George</em>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Triumph of Orthodoxy</em></strong> was made in the late Byzantine Period as part of a commemorative celebration of the end of iconoclasm.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Theotokos</strong> is enthroned in the center of the upper register. <strong>Empress Theodora and her young son</strong> take up the left. <strong>On the right</strong> is Patriarch Methodios, a man who had been tortured and imprisoned due to his love of icons and who had been raised to his post by Theodora herself.</p>
<p>In the <strong>lower register</strong> are saints, some holding icons. The background is the now typical gold. The figures are largely frontal, though there is overlapping. A few floating feet are visible. Contrasting colors are the most obvious part of this picture. The overall impression is of an intensely stylized icon-painting tradition.</p>
<p>Icons, of all Byzantine work, are usually the most rigid in form. This is partly due to the popularity of set images among the people and to the standards set by defiant defenders of icons.</p>

<p>The middle period of Byzantine art (834–1204 C.E.) begins at the end of iconoclasm. A new dynasty of Macedonian kings led by Basil I patronized the renaissance of Classical forms. This period is characterized by a renewed interest in Classical references and design. However, this initial resurgence of naturalistic art was then followed by increasing emphasis on elongated forms.</p>
<p>One of the first things the Macedonian emperors did was repair churches mutilated by iconoclasm. In 867 C.E., a new apse mosaic was added to <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>. It depicts a seated Mary Theotokos who doesn&#8217;t seem to be hovering entirely by herself. Her seat shows an attempt at three-dimensionality. Her body is more realistic; you can see her legs through the folds of her clothing. Her attitude toward her child is tender, and her hands are clearly rendered and emotive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Theotokos and Child from the apse mosaic</em></strong>. <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, <strong>Istanbul (Constantinople). 867 C.E. Mosaic.</strong></p>
<p>Perspective and emotion characterized the Middle Period. Faces are generalized, Christ&#8217;s clothing is flat, and the contrasting palette and flat gold background are stark.</p>
<p><strong>Triptychs overcame diptychs in popularity</strong> during the Middle Period. The <strong><em>Harbaville Triptych</em></strong>, made of ivory, displays Christ with Mary and St. John in the upper register of the central panel, with apostles below. Saints decorate the doors.</p>
<p>Note the frontal figures and the elongated feet, raised up on blocks. The figures on the lower registers are all wearing Classical togas, but the drapery is very flat. A decorative plant motif separates the registers in the central panel.</p>
<p>This work begins the decline of classical features and moves toward a new stylistic portrayal: bodies become more elongated and manneristic, and designs become more intricate and ornate.</p>

<p><strong>Harbaville Triptych. Constantinople. ca. 950 C.E. Ivory.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>More Ivory</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> was carved for al-Mughira, the youngest son of an Umayyad caliph, as a gift for his eighteenth birthday. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is a cylindrical container, usually used to contain perfume or cosmetics, that was traditionally given to members of royal families to commemorate special occasions and featured symbols of royal power and privilege, like hunting scenes and musical entertainments. The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> is has figural representation and is therefore <strong>not aniconic</strong>.</p>
<p>Art historians think that the symbolism represented in the pyxis illustrates the struggle between the Umayyads the Abasids, another Muslim group vying for power, and that it also served as an invitation to al-Mughira to gather power in hopes that he would be caliph. Therefore, <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> functioned as a container, a gift of luxury, and as a political work designed to serve as royal propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>Inscription</strong></p>
<p>The inscription at the base of the lid of the pyxis says &#8220;God&#8217;s blessing, favors, and happiness to a-Mughira, son of the commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him in the year 357 [968 C.E.].&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ivory</strong></p>
<p>The use of <strong>ivory</strong> is significant as it has been considered a luxury item since ancient times. Ivory objects have been found from prehistory, ancient Egypt, China, Japan, and India. While there are no surviving examples from ancient Greece, writings indicate they existed.</p>
<p><strong>Medallions</strong></p>
<p>The pyxis has four medallions, each with 8 lobes, that contain Umayyad symbolism, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scene of the attack of two bulls by two lions, which is a symbol of Umayyad victory.</li>
<li>Two men on horseback retrieving eggs from falcon nests, which symbolize the Umayyads as they were known as &#8220;the falcons of the Quraysh&#8221; and may be a symbol of the Umayyads claim to the throne.</li>
<li>A lute player between two figures, one holding a staff and a bottle, which are symbols of a ruler, the other holding a fan, thought to be a representative of the Abassids.</li>

<p>The medallions are surrounded by figures and animals that include falconers, wrestlers, griffons, peacocks, birds, goats, and animals to be hunted. The decoration is intricate and covers the entire visible surface of the pyxis.</p>

<h5><strong>A Time Without Art</strong></h5>
<p>The Middle and Late periods of <strong>Byzantine art</strong> are separated by a gulf of artless space from 1204 to 1261 C.E. This is when Constantinople was sacked by an army of the Fourth Crusade. The Latin invaders built nothing. They put up a puppet state, melting Byzantine metalwork and shipping off much of the city&#8217;s wealth.</p>
<p>When Michael VIII led the restoration of the city, poorer materials were used. Frescoes were more common than mosaics. Paper replaced parchment, and bookmaking diminished. Gold was replaced by silver gilt, pewter, and ceramic—even in the imperial court. Tradition and imitation of older work dominated. Extremities got even smaller and less detailed. Drapery was flat and angular.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Crusaders in Constantinople</em></strong>.</h5>
<p>By the 1400s, Constantinople was in ruins. Centuries of warfare had finally seen an end to the golden city.</p>
<p>Following an invasion by the Ottoman Turks, Constantinople was destroyed and renamed Istanbul in 1453 C.E. Its people were scattered. Some brought the learning of the Greeks back to the West, while some went north, where Russia stood to inherit the traditions of the Orthodox church.</p>
<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Petra, a commercial city that had architectural and artistic styles that resulted from numerous external cultural influences, became a part of the Roman Empire in 106 C.E. Constantine became the emperor of Western part of the Roman Empire and issued the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E., which ceased the persecution Christians were facing at the time. Art with Christian themes began to emerge in 190 C.E. Pagans, Jews, and Christians used catacombs that were often painted or had mosaics with religious narrative. The city of Byzantium became Constantinople and was a Christian society. Its art reflected Christian imagery and narrative, Classical heritage and cultural influence from Persia and other cultures.</p>

<h4><strong>Medieval Art and Influence of Religion</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>The Big Three</strong></h4>
<p>There are commonalities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. All three are <strong>monotheistic religions</strong> that have much basis in the Hebrew Bible. The spread of <strong>these religions impacted medieval art</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medieval art</strong> is driven by the requirements of <strong>worship, elite or court culture, and learning</strong>.</p>
<p>You have already learned about Islam and Christianity. Let’s explore <strong>how Judaism is interconnected with the Roman Empire and art of the medieval period.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Judaism</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2414" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=975%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Judaism believes in one just and fair god</strong> who is concerned with the actions of humankind. it is extrapolated from the Tanakh, or Hebrew bible, which was developed over a millennium and consists of the <strong>Torah, Nevi’im, and Ketuvim</strong>. The Hebrew bible prophesies that a messiah, promised deliverer of the Jewish nation, will come, and bring an age of universal peace and recognition of God. Judaism holds that this event has not yet happened.</p>
<h5><strong>Christianity</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2415" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=975%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Christianity-Pic.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Christianity is rooted in Judaism</strong>, but the two religions deviated from each other in the 1st century C.E. Christians incorporated the Hebrew bible as their Old Testament and have the same beliefs in the nature of God. They believe that prophesies of the Old Testament were fulfilled through Jesus, and the New Testament tells of the life of Jesus, the earliest days of the Christian church, letters of encouragement, and prophesies of what is to come.</p>
<h5><strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Roman Empire greatly impacted followers of Judaism</strong>. The Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonians in 586 B.C.E. The Second Temple was rebuilt as a replacement by 515 B.C.E. and was destroyed by Titus, the future emperor of Rome, in 70 C.E.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, synagogues rose to prominence as &#8220;little temples&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Synagogues</strong> adopted some of the functions of the destroyed Temple. <strong>Some synagogues were decorated with images depicting narratives from the Hebrew Bible</strong> beginning in the 3rd century C.E. The most extensive example discovered to date comes <strong>from the city of Dura-Europos</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>West Wall</strong></h5>
<p>The best-preserved part of the <strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue&#8217;s assembly hall is its west wall,</strong> with its focus on the niche that once held a wooden cabinet for the <strong>Torah</strong>. This is significant as it indicated the beginning of directional worship in Judaism. The west-facing niche enabled individuals to worship the scrolls and Jerusalem at the same time.</p>
<p>The <strong>three levels of narrative panels</strong> on the surrounding walls represent several scenes from the Hebrew Bible that recount the history of Israel in ways that connect to the Jewish community that worshipped there. A simple temple image marks the Torah shrine.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2416" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?resize=986%2C605&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="986" height="605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5><strong>The Exodus</strong></h5>
<p>In this detail from the <strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue paintings</strong>, we see part of the <strong>narrative in which the God of Israel delivered his people from slavery in Egypt by miraculously parting the Red Sea</strong> so that they could pass through. Like a Hebrew or Aramaic text, the <strong>narrative is read from right to left.</strong></p>
<p>Although <strong>Moses</strong> wields his staff, the presence of the large hands above—symbolic of the intervention of Israel&#8217;s God—is what truly has power to bring about the miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue</strong> does not contain an image of Israel&#8217;s god. Instead, <strong>symbols indicate divine involvemen</strong>t in the narrative like the hands from above or images of fire.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2417" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?resize=990%2C605&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Exodus (Moses and Israelites crossing the Red Sea).</strong></p>
<p>The Hebrew Bible depicts a nonphysical character of Israel&#8217;s god and contains various prohibitions against representing this god or creating images of other gods to worship, <strong>similar to aniconism in Islam</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Just a Book? Not Quite</strong></h5>
<p>One of the <strong>luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the illuminated manuscript</strong>. The earliest written documents were <strong>made of papyrus, parchment, or vellum and created in scroll form</strong> and functioned as an editable way <strong>to keep written text</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 1st century C.E., <strong>the codex</strong>, similar in format to a modern book, came into existence. A gathering of several sheets of folded vellum or parchment, this evolved in the 4th century to replace the scroll, as the scrolls were difficult to store and to access specific information quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The Vienna Genesis</strong> is a luxury manuscript made of <strong>purple dyed vellum with gold and silver writing</strong>. The <strong>purple dye is significant</strong>, as it was <strong>associated with royalty</strong>. Also was used to give imperial cloth its distinctive color—evidence of the high value placed on the manuscript.</p>
<p>It has several illuminations at the bottom of its pages. There is a continuous narrative, in a style similar to <em>Last judgment of Hu-Nefer</em>, recounting the story of Rebecca and Eliezer at the well, depicting the servant Eliezer finding a wife for Isaac, Abraham’s son.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2418" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?resize=600%2C766&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="766" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?resize=235%2C300&amp;ssl=1 235w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well, from the Vienna Genesis</strong></p>
<p>In the first episode, Rebecca leaves the city of Nahor to draw water from the well. In the second episode, she offers water to Eliezer and his camels. The city of Nahor is portrayed as a walled city in the background, like cityscapes in Roman Second Style paintings. There is also a partially nude female sitting on the well, a personification of the spring source of the well water. Both are <strong>evidence of the classical motifs and stylistic influence in Early Christian art.</strong></p>
<p>Another page shows <em>Jacob Wrestling the Angel</em>, also in continuous narrative. There are several episodes depicting Jacob’s journey and his encounter with the angel going from left to right and then twisting around and back to the left. The artist has included vegetation and the twisting of the bridge behind and in front of the figures to help create the illusion of depth.</p>
<p>Christianity during the Middle Ages placed increasing emphasis on the power of the book.</p>

<h5><strong>Only the Wealthy</strong></h5>
<p>Wealth was the determining factor when it comes to illuminated manuscripts. These books were labor-intensive and comprised of expensive materials. They were valuable and commissioned by rulers and the wealthy. Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry was commissioned by the Duke of Berry, his name says it all—wealthy patron.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2420" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Coronation-Gospels-Codex..jpg?resize=600%2C758&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="758" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Coronation-Gospels-Codex..jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Coronation-Gospels-Codex..jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Coronation Gospels Codex</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts</strong> became some of the most valuable, portable objects of the time, not only because they were frequently <strong>embossed with gold and inlaid with gems</strong>, but because <strong>creating, possessing, and reading them were acts of piety</strong>.</p>
<p>Historians have been able to determine the wealth of a site simply according to the number of books produced.</p>
<p>Many <strong>illuminated manuscripts</strong> from the Carolingian Period are liturgies or <strong>Gospel Books: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John from the New Testament</strong>. Gospel Books were needed across the kingdom to meet the needs of newly built churches and monasteries.</p>
<p>These books were handwritten, illuminated, and authenticated as true to the original word. Illuminated Gospel Books were often used at a ruler’s coronation service, so many illuminated manuscripts became <strong>known as Coronation Gospels</strong>, and imperial patronage drove the production of illuminated manuscripts.</p>
<h5><strong>And the Empire Fell</strong></h5>
<p>The word <strong>medieval comes from the Latin medioaevum, meaning Middle Ages</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Medieval Period is the time between the end of classical Greco-Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Renaissance</strong>, the rebirth of classical civilization.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages can be defined, roughly, as the period in European history between the <strong>7th and the early 11th centuries C.E.</strong></p>
<p>Although <strong>medieval art</strong> has sometimes been dismissed as a barbarous decline from the standards of classical antiquity, <strong>the period produced many innovative and artistic forms of expression</strong>. Some of the earliest medieval art comes from the migration period. During this period, nomadic, nomadic non-Christian people (the <strong>Celts, Franks, Anglo–Saxons, and Vikings</strong>) produced art of great skill.</p>

<p>As the power of the Roman Empire receded during the 5th century C.E., the Franks settled in northern Gaul (France). The Merovingian Kingdom was the first French royal house.</p>
<h5><strong>Late 8th Century C.E.</strong></h5>

<p>During the late 8th century C.E., the Vikings came forth from Scandinavia and began to plunder parts of northern Europe. In some cases, they established colonies. The Vikings traveled as far as Novgorod in Russia and North America.</p>
<h5><strong>Funerary Objects, Medieval Style</strong></h5>
<p>As the power of the Roman Empire receded, non-Roman peoples began to settle across Europe. These peoples often had little familiarity with the classical tradition of artistic representation and, initially, were nomadic. Art produced was often portable, but of high quality and is categorized as animal-style art.</p>
<h5><strong>Portable is significant?</strong></h5>
<p>Yes. Portable means moveable. And, if moved far enough, it will impact another culture. And now you have another example of cross-cultural fertilization.</p>
<h5><strong>Purse cover</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Purse cover</strong>, metalworking, and other kinds of funerary objects were retrieved from the Sutton Hoo ship burial site, <strong>crafted in cloisonné</strong>, is characterized by two features:</p>
<p><strong>Interlace patterns</strong>: Interlace is derived from Roman ornamentation, but the heads of monsters are new additions.</p>
<p><strong>Animal motifs:</strong> Abstract depictions of animals have been woven together as part of the decorative patterns of the purse cover. The <strong>two motifs in the center portray falcons devouring ducks</strong>. The <strong>two outer motifs represent a human figure between two beasts</strong>, in a similar style as the Bull-headed lyre. Here, the male figures are abstracted almost beyond recognition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2422" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Purse-Cover.jpg?resize=691%2C539&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="691" height="539" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Purse-Cover.jpg?w=691&amp;ssl=1 691w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Purse-Cover.jpg?resize=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The Anglo-Saxon treasures unearthed at Sutton Hoo have been described as one of &#8220;greatest archaeological discoveries of all time&#8221;. This discovery has been turned into Netflix film <em>The Dig</em> starring Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes.</p>
<h5><strong>Shoulder clasp</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shoulder clasp</strong> (closed) retrieved from Sutton Hoo ship burial site consists of two curved parts connected with a pin that serves as a hinge. A panel on each side is <strong>decorated with millefiori </strong>insets. <strong>Interlace patterns</strong> around the borders of the clasp become <strong>serpents</strong>, which are staples of poetry from an early period in Ireland.</p>

<h5><strong>Animal head post</strong></h5>
<p>The ship from the Sutton Hoo burial site is in ruins. However, during a later period, another people, the Vikings, produced a fantastic ship that has been preserved. The 70-foot-long ship was used for burial and was covered over by a burial mound.</p>
<p>The <strong>Animal head post</strong> from the ship gives an idea of the intricacy of the ship’s decoration. Like the metal work from the Sutton Hoo burial site, it is decorated with a complex interlace design and the post becomes a beast intended to intimidate.</p>

<p><strong>Animal head post. Viking ship burial. Oseberg, Norway. ca. 825 C.E. Wood.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Merovingian looped fibula</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Merovingian looped fibula</strong> were likely the possessions of a wealthy Merovingian woman and were intended to accompany their owner into the afterlife. There are decorative patterns covering the entire surface of each of the fibulae.</p>
<p>These patterns adjust to the shape of the object, amplify the form and structure, and therefore become an organic part of the pins. A fish is incorporated below the center of each pin, and the looped forms around the edges are stylized eagles’ heads, evidence of the inclusion of abstract animal forms.</p>

<h5><strong>Manuscripts Brought to You From the British Isles</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Art of the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings</strong> served as the basis for some of the earliest Christian art in northern Europe. In addition to the Christian faith, Christian missionaries brought literacy to the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings. This led to the early medieval period production of the illuminated manuscript. The Gospel Book was quite popular.</p>
<p>Manuscripts from the British Isles reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.</p>
<p>They were produced in monasteries on the islands of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Another term sometimes used is <strong>Hiberno-Saxon art</strong>, a name that reflects the influence of the Irish monastic movement.</p>

<p><strong>The Arrest of Christ. Folio 114r. Book of Kells. ca. late 8th-early 9th century C.E. Tempera on vellum.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Book of Durrow </strong>is the earliest extant example of <strong>Hiberno-Saxon Gospel Books</strong>. It is <strong>named for the town in Ireland where it was kept</strong> in the later medieval period, but its <strong>origin is unknown</strong>.</p>
<p>One likely candidate is the monastery on Iona founded by St. Columba during the 6th century. Vikings attacked Iona during the late 8th century. It is possible that the book was taken to Durrow in the wake of this disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Incipit. Gospel of Mark. Folio 86 recto from the Book of Durrow. ca. 660–680 C.E. Ink and tempera on parchment.</strong></p>
<p>Each of the gospels begins with an <strong>incipit page</strong>, in which lavish decoration emphasizes the first letter of the text. In this example, which opens the Gospel of Mark, <strong>the I</strong> and the first part of the &#8220;N&#8221; that <strong>begin the word Initium </strong>are composed of <strong>interlace patterns and Celtic spirals</strong> that resemble the patterns in metalwork from the arts produced by Celtic and Anglo-Saxon artisans.</p>
<p>The letters and words that follow grow smaller and less elaborate. In addition to beautifying a holy book, the incipit pages have the practical purpose of helping the reader locate sections in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Evangelist Symbol</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2426" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?resize=600%2C861&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="861" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?w=331&amp;ssl=1 331w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>PHOTO: Man, symbol for Saint Matthew. Folio 21 verso from the Book of Durrow. ca. 660–680 C.E. Ink and tempera on parchment</strong>.</p>
<p>Each gospel also begins with a full-page image containing an<strong> evangelist symbol</strong>. On this page, surrounded by an interlace border, the figure of a man looks like a checkerboard with legs and a head. He has the <strong>elements of Byzantine stylization: floating, flat, and frontal</strong>. The body of the man resembles the millefiori pattern of the shoulder clasp from Sutton Hoo.</p>
<p>The floating figure is flattened, with the legs shown from the side, whereas the head is positioned frontally. Despite the extreme stylization of the figure, there are also some realistic details—in particular, the figure is <strong>shown with the hairstyle of an Irish monk</strong>, with the head shaved at the front.</p>
<h5><strong>The Lindisfarne Gospels</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Lindisfarne Gospels</strong> were <strong>written in the monastery of Lindisfarne in England</strong> and remained there until Viking raiders drove the monks out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2427" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Matthew-cross-carpet-page..jpg?resize=600%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Matthew-cross-carpet-page..jpg?w=447&amp;ssl=1 447w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Matthew-cross-carpet-page..jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Matthew, cross-carpet page.</strong></p>
<p>Like the <em>Book of Durrow</em>, it reflects the influence of migration period patterns. In this <strong>carpet page</strong>, we can see intricate interlace and millefiori patterns. Here the patterns have resolved themselves into a cross, as if this symbol of Christian faith had tamed the powers represented by the birds and other creatures that skulk in the margins.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2428" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Luke-incipit-page..jpg?resize=600%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Luke-incipit-page..jpg?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Luke-incipit-page..jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Luke-incipit-page..jpg?resize=768%2C915&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Luke incipit page.</strong></p>
<p>The Lindisfarne Gospels also include evangelist portraits, a type of image derived from early Roman Christian art. Indeed, there is strong evidence that the portraits may be copies, or at least variations on manuscript sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2429" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?resize=600%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?w=761&amp;ssl=1 761w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Luke portrait page.</strong></p>
<p>In this image, <strong>the evangelist Luke</strong> is clearly derived from Roman sources, but is remade in the visual idiom of the <strong>Hiberno-Saxon</strong> tradition. The image shows Matthew writing his gospel, and his symbol is depicted above him. The folds of Luke’s garments have been transformed into an abstract pattern, as have the evangelist’s locks of hair.</p>
<h5><strong>It’s All Narrative</strong></h5>
<p>You have experienced narrative art in different forms. The <em>Vienna Genesis</em> uses continuous narrative to recount biblical stories. The narrative of the <em>Column of Trajan</em> detailed Trajan’s victorious campaigns against the Dacians spiraling upward around the column. The <em>Ludovisi Battle Sarcophagus</em> uses forceful diagonals, dramatic contrasts, twisting figures, and emotional expressionism to convey the story of a chaotic battle scene between Romans and a northern enemy. How does art in other cultures express narrative?</p>

<h5><strong>The Bayeux Tapestry</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Bayeux Tapestry </strong>is not a real tapestry, in which figures are woven in with the thread, but <strong>an embroidered work of art,</strong> in which colored wool was stitched onto a linen background. It resembles a long comic strip made of cloth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The narrative style is a <strong>combination of pictographic Byzantine codices and Romanesque illumination.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>58 surviving scenes</strong> describe the history of the conflict, William of Normandy’s conquest, the Battle of Hastings, and the aftermath. The Battle of Hastings began when England&#8217;s King Edward the Confessor died in 1066 C.E. William of Normandy was a relative of King Edward, but Harold Godwinson was crowned king. That same year, William sailed for England, slew Harold in battle, and took the crown for himself.</p>
<p>In The Bad Omen episode of the <strong>Bayeux Tapestry</strong>, a comet flies above Harold&#8217;s palace, making its occupants uneasy. In medieval astrology, comets foretold unsettling events. This comet signifies the coming invasion of England.</p>
<p>This scene shares many aspects with illuminated manuscripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Latin words floating overhead are much like Byzantines&#8217; Greek interjections.</li>
<li>Large, bright blocks of color used in the clothing lend an almost cartoonish quality to the narratives, contrasting with the realistic presentation of the figures in the Column of Trajan.</li>
<li>The blocks of color are typical of Romanesque illumination and of most art of the period.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Medieval period</strong> is classified as <strong>the time between the end of classical Greco-Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Renaissance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medieval art was greatly impacted by the requirements of Jewish, Christian, or Islamic worship</strong>. One of the luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the <strong>illuminated manuscript</strong>. The art produced by nomadic, non-Roman peoples was often portable but of high quality and is <strong>categorized with animal-style art.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of <strong>metalworking and other kinds of funerary objects were found in the remains of a ship at the Sutton Hoo ship burial in Suffolk, England</strong>. Manuscripts from the British Isles like the <strong><em>Book of Kells, the Book of Durrow, </em></strong><em>and <strong>the Lindisfarne Gospels</strong></em> reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Roman Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The term Romanesque describes architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Romanesque</strong> reflects certain Roman techniques, such as the <strong>barrel vault</strong> and the <strong>round arch</strong>. Several stylistic sources mark the Romanesque period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The legacy of Roman Imperial or Late Antique/Early Christian architecture and sculpture—seen in the use of Roman style masonry vaulting, rather than wooden roofs, and the reintroduction of monumental architectural sculpture in stone.</li>
<li>Continuity with the traditions of Carolingian and Ottonian art</li>
<li>The influence of Byzantine and Islamic art</li>
</ul>
<p>During the <strong>Romanesque</strong> period, the <strong>Holy Roman Empire</strong> included much of what is now Germany and Northern Italy. The<strong> Salian dynasty</strong> replaced the Ottonian dynasty in the 11th century; and the Ottonian and Early Christian influence is visible in architecture as masons began to adopt Romanesque innovations in masonry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Church of Sainte-Foy</em>.</strong></p>
<p><em>h of Sainte-Foy</em>.<span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">This influence extended beyond the Holy Roman Empire. Romanesque architecture was marked by experimentation and variety. As Romanesque was influenced, in turn Romanesque stylistic qualities influenced the early development of Gothic architecture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of the use of pointed windows to help distribute weight more efficiently</li>
<li>Early experimentation with vaulting techniques, such as groin vaults and the use of <strong>ribs</strong></li>
<li>Use of segmented units to construct a regular plan</li>
<li>Rhythmic elaboration of the interior elevation and <strong>nave arcade</strong></li>
<li>The addition of the east end of the church (as in the development of the pilgrimage choir)</li>
<li>The elaboration of Carolingian west work into a dramatic two-towered entrance</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Gothic, Not the Trend You Thought It Was</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Gothic period</strong>, known as the age of the great cathedrals, began in approximately 1150 C.E. and lasted until about 1400 C.E. Although it originated in France, the Gothic style spread throughout Western Europe to become the first truly International Style. The Gothic aesthetic encompassed a wide range of structures and media, including churches, palaces, and portraits.</p>
<p>Gothic architecture is best defined as the &#8220;quest for height and light&#8221;, considered to be an opposing pole to the Classical Greco-Roman styles in Europe. The heart of the Gothic aesthetic was the belief that divinity could be experienced through the senses, and Gothic architecture sought to connect viewers to the heavens with high, soaring vaults; bright, multicolored lights; and echoing sounds.</p>

<p><strong>The Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, exterior view of the west façade. Paris, France. ca. 1135–1140 C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The characteristic forms of Gothic emphasized and facilitated this heavenly encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>lofty masonry that reached toward the heavens</li>
<li>complex, ornate lines with elegant patterns</li>
<li>high, thin walls with great expanses of richly colored stained glass in large windows that allowed for extensive light</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>Elaborated architecture to support a socio-political development</p>
<p>Now that you know the characteristics—Gothic art and architecture is crazy elaborate—it’s time to move on to what it’s about: the social and political stuff.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2131" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?resize=990%2C654&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="654" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha-1.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this gallery, you will achieve an understanding of <strong>art and architecture of West, Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia.</strong> How is art and architecture evidence of cross-cultural connections and influences? How are religious beliefs and practices represented within art and architecture? How does patronage influence artistic and architectural production?</p>
<p>You will explore the cultural distinction of Asia</p>
<ul>
<li>the religions of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism</li>
<li>the influence of these religions and social hierarchy on art and architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Gallery Objectives</strong></h5>
<p>Different cultural and religious values are reflected in the art and architecture of a culture and dictate how sacred space is used. The beliefs of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism necessitated different characteristics in the sacred architecture and art. This is evidenced in how deities are represented in the art and the architectural designs. Trade transmitted both religious and artistic influence throughout Asia, and political entities utilized art and architecture to represent religious support of leadership.</p>
<h4><strong>Monuments of Faith</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>distinguish architectural elements of mosques</li>
<li>recognize the connection between religious needs and religious function of architecture</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sacred Connections</strong></h5>
<p>Think about your community and the buildings it contains. Can you visualize political structures like city hall or the courthouse? Do they contain common features like columns or large, ascending staircases? Think about places of worship in your community. Do they contain common features?</p>
<p>The use of architecture for religious needs is a common thread that connects cultures, despite time or geography. There are elements that are specific to religion or culture, like the <strong>ark in Jewish synagogues</strong>, <strong>the cross in Christian cathedrals</strong>, and the <strong>mihrab</strong> in Muslim <strong>mosques</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The definition of Islam is &#8220;submission to the one God,&#8221; and its followers are referred to as Muslim, or &#8220;those who submit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Islam rose in Arabia early in the 7th century and eventually brought the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Its extensive advance was not only the result of military conquests, but also of the nature of the Islamic faith and its appeal to millions of converts. This advance resulted in altering sacred architecture in regions that were conquered to accommodate the needs of Muslim worshipers.</p>
<p>The art and architecture of the Muslims represents the different techniques and ideas from diverse cultures that converted to Islam, and the impact of Islam was reflected in the art and architecture of other cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Art and architecture can have a sacred function.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Pillars of Islam</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2247 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=599%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="599" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?w=599&amp;ssl=1 599w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2247" class="wp-caption-text">Koran Manuscript</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are <strong>commonalities between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity</strong>. Islam incorporates Old Testament teachings, ethical standards, and rejection of idol worship. <strong>All three beliefs segment after the Old Testament.</strong></p>
<p>Muslims worship without a hierarchy of rabbis, priests, or saints acting as intercessors. Muhammad was believed to be God’s messenger and is considered the Final Prophet in a line that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He began to receive revelations of God through the archangel Gabriel and was persecuted by Meccan leaders who disagreed with his message.</p>
<p>In 622 C.E., he fled the city of Mecca for a desert oasis called Medina, or “City of the Prophet.” This exodus was called the <em>hijra</em>, or emigration, and is considered the beginning of the Islamic religion. Eight years later, Muhammad returned to Mecca with an army of 10,000, took control of the city, and converted the population to Islam.</p>
<p>Muhammad destroyed all the idols and preserved the <em>Kaaba</em>, the symbolic center of the Islamic world. He died in Medina in 632 C.E.</p>
<p>Muslims live according to the <em>Koran</em>, Islam’s sacred book.</p>
<p>This book was arranged by the Muslim ruler, Uthman, and contains the collected revelations communicated through Muhammad during his lifetime. It has 114 surahs, or chapters, divided into verses.</p>
<p>The duties of the Islamic faith include the <strong>Five Pillars of Islam</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Shahadah</strong>: Assert that <strong>there is only one God</strong> and that Muhammad is his messenger.</p>
<p><strong>Salat</strong>: Pray five times a day facing Mecca (where <em>The Kaaba</em> is located).</p>
<p><strong>Zakah</strong>: Give <strong>alms</strong> to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>Sawm</strong>: Fast during the month of <strong>Ramadan</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hajj</strong>: Make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime (if possible).</p>
<p>The Five Pillars guide Muslims in the commitment and practice of Islam, and the reward for the faithful is paradise. Islam also features a union of religious and secular authority, joining religious and political leadership in one ruler. This practice continued after Muhammad in the form of caliphs, or successors, who took charge of the community’s political and spiritual matters.</p>
<h5><strong>Is the Center of the World a Cube?</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> is a cubical, textile-draped shrine said to have been built for God by Abraham and Ishmael. It had been inundated with pagan idols before Muhammad conquered Mecca. After the battle at Mecca, Muhammad removed the idols, preserved the structure, and dedicated it to Allah.</p>
<figure id="attachment_789" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-789" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-789" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?resize=700%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="465" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?w=337&amp;ssl=1 337w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183-AP.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-789" class="wp-caption-text">The Kaaba<br />© Kazuyoshi Nomachi/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stripping of the idols resulted in the concept of <strong>aniconism</strong><strong>,</strong> avoiding figural imagery and graven images, in art. <strong>Islamic art that is created for religious purposes</strong> does not contain figural imagery. Islamic art and architecture take on both sacred and secular function. <strong>Aniconism</strong> has, therefore, resulted in variances in the imagery of sacred and secular art and architecture.</p>
<p>Religious architecture includes both mosques and commemorative monuments, but <strong>in comparison to religious buildings from Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity</strong>, there is an evident lack of <strong>graven images</strong>. Manuscripts or objects containing sacred text can contain <strong>calligraphy</strong>, <strong>illumination</strong>, or <strong>geometric and plant decoration</strong>, but cannot have the representation of figures. Due to the religious purpose of the Islamic commemorative monuments, <strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong><em>,</em> there is no figural imagery.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Kaaba</em></strong> represents the center of the Islamic world, is the place where all Muslim prayer is directed, and is the destination of the Islamic pilgrimage, or hajj.</p>
<figure id="attachment_788" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-788" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-788" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?resize=700%2C463&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="463" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?w=440&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-183.-The-Kaaba.-Aerial-View.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-788" class="wp-caption-text">Gathering at the Kaaba<br />© ALI JAREKJI/Reuters/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>This monument is covered with a silk curtain that is <strong>embroidered with calligraphy</strong> in gold and silver-wrapped thread. The use of expensive materials is often a representation of paradise in Muslim art and architecture. The curtain lacks figural imagery and is replaced annually during the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Every year during the month of pilgrimage, Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca. This occurs from the eighth to the twelfth of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar, and as it is a <strong>lunar calendar</strong>, it is 11 days shorter than the common <strong>Gregorian calendar</strong> used as standard today.</p>
<p>The worshipers move around, or <strong>circumambulate</strong>, the <em>Kaaba</em> seven times in a counterclockwise direction. This act is believed to show the unity of the believers in worship of Allah. Worshipers rise from the lowest of the seven steps, or stages, of the soul to the highest.</p>
<p><strong>The Kaaba</strong> has been modified and expanded extensively throughout its history to fix damage that had occurred, enlarge the area, or replace the cover. The last alterations took place in the 1950s by the Saudi Arabian government to accommodate the large number of pilgrims who come on the Hajj.</p>
<h5><strong>The <em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-793" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-793" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=700%2C704&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="704" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock-AP-Image-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-793" class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Rock<br />© SEF/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is the first great Islamic monument and the third most holy site in Islam. It was commissioned as an architectural tribute to the triumph of Islam by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik between 687 and 692 C.E. It is built on the Noble Enclosure or “The Foundation Stone,” a rock that is the site of the first and second Jewish temples.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-794" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-and-Exterior-Drwaing.jpg?resize=600%2C553&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="553" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The site is also significant as it is the presumed location of Adam’s grave, the place where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac, and the location where Muhammad began his journey to heaven. The coming of a new religion to Jerusalem was marked by building on a site holy to both the Jewish and Christian faiths. The <strong><em>Dome of the Rock</em></strong> is the first architectural display of Islam’s belief: that it completed the prophecies of both Judaism and Christianity and supersedes them. It is a statement of the idea that Islam is the completion of the worshiper’s connection with God.</p>
<figure id="attachment_795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-795" style="width: 683px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-795" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?resize=683%2C860&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="683" height="860" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-185.-Dome-of-the-Rock.-Interior-Photo.jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-795" class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Rock<br />© Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>With a central-plan structure, the<em> <strong>Dome of the Rock</strong></em> imitates the form of early Christian and Byzantine <strong>martyria</strong>. The 75-foot double-shelled dome is made of wood, and then covered with gold, a valuable material used as a representation of paradise. It is supported by alternating piers and columns. This creates <strong>concentric</strong> aisles that allow worshipers to circumambulate the rock in the center, again demonstrating the oneness of the Muslims in worship.</p>
<h4><strong>Calligraphy</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>summarize the impact of Islamic art on outlying cultures and regions</li>
<li>explain the role of calligraphy in religious artworks, luxury objects, and architecture</li>
<li>compare Islamic architecture with architecture of other cultures <strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Calligraphy was a prominent art form, particularly in Islamic art in West Asia where beautiful forms were created to transmit sacred texts. Calligraphy is found on <strong>architecture, decorative arts objects</strong>, and <strong>ceramic tiles</strong>, as well as in <strong>manuscripts</strong> written on paper, cloth, or vellum.</p>

<figure id="attachment_2253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253" style="width: 999px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2253" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?resize=990%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="483" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-191-C.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2253" class="wp-caption-text">A close up of the inscription</figcaption></figure>
<p>At one end of the carpet is an <strong>inscription of poetry in three lines</strong>. It begins with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br />
The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</p></blockquote>
<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.</p>
<p>The fourth line provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.</p>
<h5><strong>The Reverence of Calligraphy in Islamic Art </strong></h5>
<p>Islamic culture values poetry and oral tradition. They believed that the message of God was revealed through the prophet Muhammad, so words are the priority of the religion. Unlike Christianity it does not have a use for iconic images.</p>
<p>The beautiful writings of calligraphy were considered the highest art. It was used not only to spread the words of the Qur’an but also decorative images as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: &#8220;The first thing God created was the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Islamic calligraphy includes </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Arabic Calligraphy, Ottoman, and Persian calligraphy</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">. It developed from two major styles: </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Kufic</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">, the oldest form of Arabic script and </span><strong style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">Naskh</strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.0625rem;">, traditionally used for more informal purposes. It is important to note that there are variations on each style, as well as regional differences.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Folio from a Qur’an</em></strong> was created with ink, color, and gold on parchment paper. The paper was costly and made from sheep or goat skin.  The work measures 12 inches wide.</p>
<figure id="attachment_820" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-820" style="width: 986px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-820" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=986%2C570&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="986" height="570" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-187.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-820" class="wp-caption-text">Folio from a Qur’an<br />© The Pierpont Morgan Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The word folio simply means a page in a book. Dimensions of the page were calculated carefully before cutting the parchment.</p>
<p><strong>The page uses calligraphy</strong> or writing that is intentionally decorative to indicate status and significance. Each page contains only nine lines of calligraphy. Calligraphic style used is known as Kufic. This method employed strokes of uniform thickness, short straight vertical lines, and long horizontal lines.</p>
<p>Early Korans would only feature three to five lines per page to meet the need for visual clarity, as there were times one Koran would be shared by several readers. Since the copies were hand-produced and were finely crafted, they were expensive and rare. <strong>The red marks</strong> function as pronunciation guides, and the chapter title, page numbers, geometric designs, and vegetal imagery are embedded in the golden ornament in the middle of the page. <strong>Gold is significant, as it is symbolic of paradise in Islamic culture.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Court of Gayumars, folio from Shah Tahmasp’s Shahnama. Sultan Muhammad. c. 1522–1525 C.E. Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calligraphy was used to embellish luxury objects</strong>. These smaller-scale luxury arts feature an immense collection of manuscript paintings, ceramics, and metalwork and are examples of both the range and quality of Islamic skill. <em>The Shahnama, or Book of King</em>s, is a Persian national epic poem by Firdawsi (904–1025 C.E.) that recounts the history of Iran from creation until the Muslim conquest. This poem is paired with manuscript paintings in the Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp. There are 258 illustrations by many artists in this book that was presented as a gift to Selim II, who commissioned the Selimiye Mosque.</p>
<p>This specific page, <em><strong>Court of Gayumars</strong></em>, was painted by Sultan Muhammad. A non-religious work, it uses figural imagery to depict Gayumars, the legendary first king of Iran, as he presides over his court from his mountain throne.</p>
<p>The image is placed off-center as if it is floating, and delicate figures of the court, animals, trees, rocks, and sky populate a lush landscape. This enhances the sense of lightness and airiness, giving the illustration a heavenly appearance and a reference to paradise. The animals, trees, and rocks support the text in the Shahnama, which states that wild beasts became instantly tame in the presence of the Gayumars.</p>
<p>The poem, in calligraphy, encompasses the top and bottom of the painting. The manuscript became part of a private collection in the West and was eventually split and sold as individual pages. This is evidence of the Western collector’s view that each page was an independent work of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Metalwork</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Islamic metalwork</strong>, which encompassed <strong>metal plaques, vessels, arms, armor, and sculpture, was considered one of the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world</strong>, extending well beyond West Asia. Islamic metalsmiths would ornament the surface of vessels with scrolls, interlacing designs, <strong>calligraphic inscriptions</strong>, and human and animal figures. As these vessels were not religious in nature, the aniconism of the Islamic religion does not apply.</p>
<p>The<strong> Basin</strong> by Muhammad ibn al-Zain is made of brass and inlaid with gold and silver. The practice of inlaid brass work was common from the mid-12th century forward due to a shortage of silver. Basins similar to this were used for washing hands at official political ceremonies, and this specific basin may have been fashioned for a Mamluk sultan for use in his palace.</p>

<p><strong>Basin (Baptistère de St. Louis). Muhammad ibn al-Zain. c. 1320–1340 C.E. Brass inlaid with gold and silver.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The skill of the work denotes the generosity of the patron, but the lack of a specific inscription means there is no evidence of whom the basin was created for. The artist, Muhammad ibn al-Zain, signed the basin six times. This was uncommon, and the exact reason al-Zain did this is unknown.</p>
<p>The surface is decorated with three bands whose backgrounds feature stylized vegetal forms of inlaid silver. The upper and lower bands depict running animals, and the center band shows Mamluk hunters and Mongol enemies. Both the inside and underside are decorated with figures and animals. The basin was acquired by the French and referred to as the <strong><em>Baptistère de St. Louis</em></strong>. It was used in the baptismal rites of newborns of the French royal family as early as the 17th century and is an example of both the status and widespread influence of Islamic art.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mughals–a Little Islamic… And a Little European too</strong></h5>
<p>The Mughals were the most successful of the many Islamic groups that established themselves in India beginning in the 12th century, and they presided over a cosmopolitan court with refined tastes. Foreign ambassadors and merchants often visited, and the emperors admired Persian art and sought out European luxury goods. This resulted in <strong>artworks and architecture that had both European and Islamic influence,</strong> an outcome of cross-fertilization.</p>
<p>Jahangir was the fourth Mughal emperor and ruled from 1605 until 1627. Jahangir commissioned a painting from the <strong><em>artist Bichitr</em></strong>, who portrayed his patron in both a European and Islamic style. The painting Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings features a scroll-like border with intricate vegetal patterns.</p>
<p>Islamic influence is seen in the intricate vegetal patterns framing the painting, and <strong>the calligraphy is in two pairs of cartouches both at the top and the bottom of the painting</strong>. The intricate vegetal patterns are continued in the lower portion of the painting. Jahangir is shown sitting on top of an hourglass throne, with four figures to the left. The top figure is a Muslim Sufi Shaykh, or mystic saint, who is being presented with a book from Jahangir, below him is a Turkish sultan, then a full European style portrait of King James I of England, and then below him a representation of the artist himself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-844" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=500%2C729&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="729" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-208.jpg?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</em>. Bichitr. c. 1620 C.E. Watercolor, gold, and ink on paper.</strong></p>
<p>The allegorical style of the painting is evidence of the European influence of style. The tower of figures represents the social hierarchy in the emperor’s eyes.</p>
<p>The inscription “although to all appearances kings stand before him, Jahangir looks inwardly toward the dervishes” attests that the emperor looks to Islamic holy men for guidance.</p>
<p>By placing himself in the lowest place in the tower, <strong>Bichitr </strong>recognizes that he is lowest in status. He also portrays himself giving Jahangir a gift, displaying his reverence for the emperor. The hourglass symbolizes that Jahangir sits above time. The side profile view of the faces is evidence of European influence, but King James I of England’s face is looking directly at the painter, as it was copied from a painting given as a gift to Jahangir. Jahangir’s head is encircled in a radiant halo that combines a sun and a white crescent moon. This <strong>halo is a visual display of Jahangir’s title of honor</strong> and evidence of European and Byzantine influence. This, in addition to the scrollwork and calligraphy, is also evidence of Islam influence, specifically from the Shahnama.</p>
<h5><strong>Calligraphy and Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>In the Buddhism of India, writing was always encouraged not only by monks and nuns, but the regular, everyday person who was Buddhist. This involved handwriting Buddhist scripture.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhist Calligraphy </strong>refers to the lettering art that draws subject from Buddhist literature. The artists are Buddhists and secular individuals.</p>
<p>Then there is<strong> calligraphy of Buddhists. </strong>This form of calligraphy does not necessarily present words from Buddhism.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chinese calligraphy</strong>, more than half of the famous works from ancient China are based on Buddhist subjects or created by Buddhists. These works can be classified into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manuscripts</li>
<li>Inscriptions</li>
<li>Engraving Scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>It is further classified by author:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calligraphy of Buddhists</li>
<li>Calligraphy of Secular Artists</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Manuscripts</strong></h5>
<p>Long before printing presses, <strong>Chinese Buddhist masters</strong> copied all scriptures into manuscripts by hand. The work starts with a title, main section containing spaces between paragraphs and a postscript. The result is simplistic yet elegant.</p>
<h5><strong>Inscriptions</strong></h5>
<p>Inscriptions were also part of Buddhist calligraphy. One area of prominence was grottoes art in famous Buddhist temple grottoes.</p>
<p>Such Chinese Buddhist temple grottoes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yungang</li>
<li>Longmen</li>
<li>Dunhuang</li>
</ul>
<p>These inscriptions were used for models for later calligraphers.</p>
<p>Other inscriptions can be found in mountains and stupas.</p>
<h5><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Calligraphic style of the Buddhist sect known as Zen in Japan and Cha’an in China included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bokuseki</strong>, or ink trace in Japanese.</li>
<li>Chinese <strong>(Wade-Giles romanization) Mo-chi, </strong>or (Pinyin)<strong>Moji</strong>,</li>
</ul>
<p>These forms of calligraphy were a direct result of Cha’an Buddhism crossing into Japan during the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century. During the Moromachi period (1338-1573) <strong>Bokuseki</strong> was a part of a distinguished monks accomplishments. Monks admired for this include:  Musō Soseki (1275–1351), Sesson Yūbai (1290–1346), and Tesshū Tokusai (fl. 1342–66).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ani-Aniconism</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>recognize the representation of the divine in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>contrast sacred spaces related to Hinduism and Buddhism</li>
<li>examine religious burial practices in South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Hindu Art and Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Similar to calligraphy in Islam, <strong>mantras are written ornately on Hindu art and architecture</strong>. The first symbol in the Tibetan mantra pictured is Om. As Hindus worship, mantras are recited that bring the deity into the image. Om is used at the end of a prayer as an invitation to the deity.</p>
<p>The belief that the deity is present is not taken lightly, and the image will not be removed from the temple. Individuals pray and make offerings like food, flowers, water, oil, dancing, or ritual sacrifices to the deity, supporting their belief that the deity is physically present in the image and, therefore, must be cared for.</p>

<h5><strong>Hindu Temples, Break It Down</strong></h5>
<p>From the 10th through the 14th centuries, India was largely a cluster of small kingdoms and different areas that developed highly individualized styles. The forms for temples in the north and south remained standard, although each building reflected the creator&#8217;s personal aesthetic and spiritual sensibility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2566" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?resize=598%2C794&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="598" height="794" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?w=271&amp;ssl=1 271w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shikara-TEmple.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Image: Shikara (tower) in a northern-style temple, carved from base to tip with colorful figures and reliefs.</strong></p>
<p>In the northern-style temple, the tower is called a <strong>shikara</strong>. It has a slightly convex shape and tapers at the top, where it is crowned by a flattened and fluted stone called an amalaka or fruit.At the very top, a finial connects the earthly realm below to the celestial above. Temples are symbolic in form, based on the mandala that symbolically connects the heavens and earth.</p>

<p><strong>The Vishnu Temple</strong> at Deogarh is one of the earliest temples in this northern style. The doorway, visible in this image, demonstrates the importance of the concept of the portal.</p>
<p>This is the passage from the ordinary world of the flesh to a place of spirit. Stepping over the threshold is a symbolic act of purification.</p>
<h5> Buddhism Iconism-Aniconism</h5>
<p>“To the first of his followers, and the tradition associated with <strong>Theravada Buddhism</strong> and figures like the great Emperor Ashoka, the Buddha was a man, not a God. He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of <strong>India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand</strong>.</p>
<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the <strong>Mahayana School</strong>, Buddha was a savior and often a god—a god concerned with man’s sorrows above all else. The Mahayana form of Buddhism is <strong>in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan</strong>. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.</p>
<p>The <strong>aniconic mode</strong> of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism</strong> (Sanchi Stupa) developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that never show the Buddha in human form. Instead, his presence was <strong>indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations</strong> as well as by his “non-image.”</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>the Chinese aniconic phase refrained from any pictorial representation</strong> and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy.</strong> The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.</p>
<p>A record left by the thirteenth-century monk Dharmasvamin of his visit to Bodh Gaya is especially interesting considering the problem of <strong>aniconism</strong>. Like earlier pilgrims to the sacred site, Dharmasvamin did not find the living Buddha at Bodh Gaya. Instead, what he described is not unlike what we see in some of the so-called aniconic reliefs, for he said that &#8220;inside the courtyard stood the empty throne of Sakyamuni . . . which was worshipped, and an eternal offering lamp was kept in front of it.”</p>

<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa Early Aniconic representations of Buddha: “the non-image”</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>At the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi 1st century CE </strong></h5>
<p>Sculptural friezes at important early Buddhist stupas like Sanchi depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the <strong>Buddha represented in aniconic form, using certain fixed symbols</strong>. On the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi the Buddha’s body is <strong>represented by the Body tree</strong>, a crowning lotus rosette on a column like structure, a stupa, the Buddha’s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).</p>
<p>Each symbol represents a pivotal event in Buddha’s life: <strong>a lotus</strong> (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, <strong>a fig tree or throne</strong> representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, <strong>a wheel, a flaming column</strong> with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and <strong>a stupa</strong> (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.  In some cases he is also represented by <strong>a pair of footprints</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>The icon (corporeal body) of the Buddha in India and China: Gandhara style</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Buddhism along the Silk Road Gandharan Buddha 2nd century</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandhara</strong> is the ancient name of a region in northwest Pakistan bounded on the west by the Hindu Kush Mountain range and to the north by the foothills of the Himalayas. In 330 B.C., Alexander the Great conquered this region and familiarized its artists with the classical Greek sculpture.</p>
<p>Starting about 50 B.C., Kushan era, the sea trade driven by monsoons increased. Thus, merchants from Rome and the Middle East passed through <strong>Gandhara</strong> on their way to Central Asia and China. Gandharan control of the high mountain passes vital to this international commerce made the region wealthy. The resulting cosmopolitan elites became some of the most powerful Buddhist patrons in all of South Asia.</p>
<p>Gandhara’s art combines <strong>(syncretism)</strong> local characteristics with elements derived from <strong>both Indian and western (Greek, Roman) cultures.</strong></p>
<p>After the 1st century C.E., with the development of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form. These new, iconic images of the Buddha were particularly popular in the region of Gandhara and in Māthura, south of New Delhi. They were depictions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, i.e. bodhisattvas. Many of the concepts characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism—the later form of Buddhism—appear to have developed in Gandhara.</p>
<p>These <strong>anthropomorphic images usher in a new phase of Buddhist art</strong> in which artists convey meaning through the <strong>depiction of special bodily marks (lakshanas) and hand gestures (mudras)</strong> of the Buddha.</p>
<p>In this anthropomorphic image of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the artist depicts Prince Siddhartha seated on a throne, surrounded by the demon Mara and his army, who attempted—unsuccessfully—to thwart Prince Siddhartha’s attainment of enlightenment. At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth, calling the earth to witness his spiritual awakening. In doing so he becomes the Buddha.</p>

<ul>
<li>the body is hidden with heavy cloak echoing a Roman toga; its sharp folds echoing Greek Parthenon draping styles form concentric curves centered on the right shoulder.</li>
<li>the face is elongated, the chin is quite prominent, and the corners of the relatively thin mouth are slightly sunken.</li>
<li>the eyes are narrow under a heavy lid, gazing downward in compassion to the world</li>
<li>the wavy Greek-like hair is gathered into a topknot symbolic of wisdom</li>
<li>a lightly incised circle, called an urna, appears between the eyes. The urna was an identifying mark of the Buddha’s divine status and ability to see beyond our realm.</li>
<li>Buddha has long earlobes that recall the heavy royal earrings he once wore</li>
<li>the second-century Bodhisattva Maitreya had a musculature markedly western/Greek</li>
</ul>
<p>The bodily attributes displayed in Buddhist sculpture varied only slightly</p>
<p>The Buddha is shown in his human shape because of his last incarnation in the human world, but particular bodily marks are witness to his transcendence of the human realm. After enlightenment, the historical prince Siddhartha Gautama acquired various marks (lakshana) that identify him as the Buddha.</p>
<p>The <strong>importance of the bodily attributes</strong> for any Buddha image in India and China can hardly be overestimated. Descriptions of these are formalized in the Buddhist canon, specifying 32 primary and 80 secondary superhuman attributes. For the most part, however, the local lists are homogenous.</p>
<p>The major bodily attributes of a Buddha are witness to his completion of awakening and are, therefore, the only adequate way to represent him in human form. The Buddha’s body is dignified, well proportioned, and extremely tall, with its slender and long limbs.  There is a top hair bump, and the hair is fashioned into tiny snail stylized curls. Another mark is the urna between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s earlobes are extended in reference to the heavy jewelry he wore previously as a prince. He wears a simple monk’s robe, in keeping with his spiritual purpose, and sits in a lotus position.</p>
<p>Fingers have all the same length, or special markings on the palms and on the soles of the feet. All parts of the Buddha’s body, even features that cannot be represented, like his voice, are determined by his being enlightened.</p>
<p>Often the face and the uncovered parts of the body were gilded, representing the light emitting from the Enlightened One’s body. His skin was said to be of a golden hue, emitting light from every single pore.</p>
<p>Other important attributes mentioned in the texts pertain to the meanings of his hands position, the mudras, which evoke ideas during Buddhist meditation or rituals:</p>
<ul>
<li>right hand over right knee (calling Earth as a witness to Enlightenment)</li>
<li>right hand held up with palm out (symbolizing giving reassurance, “no fear”)</li>
<li>hands held at chest with fingers turning invisible wheel (setting in motion the “wheel of the doctrine”—that is, preaching)</li>
<li>hands placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched palms facing upwards (“meditation mudra”)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathura was a sacred place for the followers of Jainism</strong> who sculpted their deities. The <strong>Mathura Buddhas </strong>are related to the earlier Indian yakṣa figures (male nature deity). This is a direct continuation of the old Indian art of Sanchi with few Gandharan elements facial types will establish the traits of the Buddha iconography:</p>
<ul>
<li>full of energy with broad shoulders, swelling chest</li>
<li>if standing the legs are firmly planted and spaced apart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mudras:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>left hand palm facing down in “calling earth as witness” mudra</li>
<li>often the right hand forms a mudra of “fearlessness” representing protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear; the left arm akimbo or resting on the thigh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warmer Climatic Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buddha’s torso is dressed with a transparent monk’s robe</li>
<li>a higher fluidity of the clothing</li>
<li>drapery is closely molding the body giving the illusion of nudity.</li>
<li>details tend to be less realistic, and more symbolic</li>
<li>radiant inner calm and stillness, the products of supreme wisdom</li>
<li>earlier the shaven head and the topknot of the head indicated by a tiered spiral</li>
</ul>
<p>Later Buddhas had shell-like hair curls, which became the standard representation throughout the Buddhist world. These Buddhas have ornate halos around the Buddha’s head, while in Gandharan art the aureole is plain.</p>
<ul>
<li>garments with lotus flower (symbol of purity) design</li>
<li>the presence of either the lion throne or the lotus throne.</li>
<li>the sitting Buddha images naturalistic pose with legs crossed</li>
<li>represented as powerful with broad shoulders and open eyes</li>
<li>more warmer climate adaptations: the right shoulder bare,</li>
</ul>
<p>Standing Buddhas tend to display characteristics and attitudes seen in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara:</p>
<ul>
<li>the clothing covers both shoulders, with symmetric folds</li>
<li>the left hand holds the gown of the Buddha while the other hand (Roman toga style)</li>
<li>the folds in the clothing are more typical of the Gandharan style</li>
</ul>

<p>A remarkable parallel can be drawn with the icon of Christ. The portrayal of his physical features follows the notion of a “delineation,” which places every human being into a coded system of particular features that establish a distinctive identity. The Patriarchs of the Byzantine stated that “The icon of a man is not inscribed according to nature, but according to position.” (Barber 2002). In other words, there was no doubt about what the historical, incarnated Christ “looked like,” because there was only one way in which he could have manifested physically in the world. Thus “an icon has to be seen as a living eyewitness of actual events.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<h4><strong>Natural and Spiritual</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>recognize symbolism and iconography of the natural and spiritual world in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>evaluate cross-cultural impact of religious and political themes</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>iconographic symbolism, natural motifs, and themes of human’s connection</strong> with both the <strong>natural and spirit world</strong> in <strong>Buddhism and Shindoism</strong> saturated non-religious art and reflected the continued impact from Silk Route and trade.</p>
<h5>China</h5>
<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism</strong>. Predating this are philosophies and historical texts that are based around nature and the cosmos. This later influenced Chinese Buddhism.</p>
<h5><strong>Neo-Confucianism in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Self − Qi + Li = Oneness</strong></p>
<p>Daoism and Confucianism were both prevalent ethical, philosophical, and religious systems in China when Buddhism was introduced. <strong>Neo-Confucianism merges the three philosophies</strong> and teaches that the universe consists of two interacting forces know as li, or idea, and qi, or matter, “The individual’s goal is to rid the qi of impurities through education and self-cultivation so that the li may realize its oneness with the Great Ultimate.”</p>
<h5><strong>Essence</strong></h5>
<p>Art, like monument landscape painting, expressed Neo-Confucian ideas visually. The artist’s goal was to paint the essence of the landscape, not to reproduce the appearance of it. The artist was required to understand all of the aspects of the li of the landscape and, therefore, would express the desire for the spiritual communion with nature that was the key to enlightenment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1487" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1487" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1487" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/201.jpg?resize=500%2C1091&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="1091" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/201.jpg?w=154&amp;ssl=1 154w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/201.jpg?resize=138%2C300&amp;ssl=1 138w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1487" class="wp-caption-text">Travelers among Mountains and Streams<br />© Fan Kuan/Corbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>In <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, Fan Kuan relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape, embracing Neo-Confucian ideas. Gaps between the tree distances function like pauses between the varying views.</p>
<p>Scale in the piece <strong>emphasizes the sense of vastness and space</strong>. The small trees and shrubs are dwarfed in light of the size of the mountain.</p>
<p>The painting, presenting universal creation in its totality, is an orderly statement reflecting the artist’s worldview. The essence of the landscape in <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, including the sense of vastness and space, supported viewers as they meditated while seeking spiritual communion with nature and, therefore, seeking enlightenment.</p>
<p>Silk was both a popular and valuable material, and it was able to be made in large pieces to support large, monument landscape paintings like <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>. At over seven feet high, the piece differs from the Japanese hand scrolls—small-scale secular paintings designed to be appreciated in private settings. These pieces differ in not only size but also subject. The hand scroll <strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> is an account of a battle, unlike the natural mountain view in <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Korea</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism came to Korea from China in the 4th century C.E. and carried with it symbolic themes of the natural and spirit world. Tombs of the Silla kingdom contained artworks representative of the wealth and power of its rulers.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Gold and jade crown</em></strong> is made of sheet gold, embossed along the edges, and is an example of the high level of skill among the artists in the Silla kingdom. This technique may have come from China.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1470" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1470" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?resize=600%2C681&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?w=298&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/196-Jade-and-Gold-Crwon.jpg?resize=264%2C300&amp;ssl=1 264w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1470" class="wp-caption-text">Gold and jade crown<br />© DeA Picture Library/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gold rivets and wires secure the pieces of jade along the crown and horn-like projections. Jade is significant as it was both a symbol of the wealthy and elite, but it was also believed that it possessed magical qualities that could protect the dead. The projections are representative of tree and antler forms and are believed to symbolize life and supernatural power, suggesting the connection of nature to the supernatural world.</p>
<h5><strong>Japan</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>beauty of the changing seasons</strong> has always been <strong>celebrated by the people of Japan.</strong> Each season brings its own celebrations and festivals. This is also part of <strong>Shinto</strong>, Japan’s native belief system and indigenous religion. It has been preserved in and has been part of the everyday fabric of Japanese life.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine Shinto</strong> had a close relationship to the Imperial royal family and was both a religion and a state. <strong>Sect Shinto</strong> originated around the 19<sup>th</sup> century and has 13 major sects organized by the founder or systematizer. <strong>Folk Shinto</strong> is based on Japanese folk beliefs. All three are interrelate.</p>
<p><strong>Poetry and visual arts</strong> are part of Shinto. Kokinshu (A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern) is the first known works of Japanese poetry, and nature is the inspiration. Shinto paintings of the Heian period show Spring blossoms Autumnal leaves and winter scenes.</p>

<p>The work above, from the Metropolitan Museum is entitled <strong><em>Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons</em></strong>. It was painted in the late 16<sup>th</sup> century during the Momoyama period (1573-1615), in Japan. The work is a pair of six-panel folding screens with ink, color, gold, and gold leaf. The story moves from right to left.</p>
<p>Here are some detailed close ups:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many paintings depict the <strong>transitioning of seasons</strong>. A theme in both Shinto and Buddhist art is the <strong>theme of beauty and brevity</strong>. For a more minute view of seasonal changes flowering plants and flowers become painting compositions.</p>

<p>Decorative arts were adorned in the same way. Think ceramics, lacquerware and even kimonos.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>In Japan, painting of landscape also incorporated varying techniques. In <strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong>, Ogata Korin used <strong>tarashikomi</strong>, which literally means “dripping in.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?resize=320%2C286&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="320" height="286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/210-B-1.jpg?resize=300%2C268&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2237" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?resize=318%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="318" height="287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/201-A-1.jpg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Tarashikomi involves applying a second layer of paint before the first is dry. This results in a dripping form that creates fine details like ripples in water or leaves and is specifically used in <strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> to depict the tree trunks.</p>
<p>This painting, like <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains</em></strong>, relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape. The stream cuts through the center, giving the impression of expansion. The trees offer asymmetrical views. The white plum tree on the left is mostly outside of the screen, while the red plum tree on the right is mostly within the screen</p>
<h5>Gardens</h5>
<p><strong>Wet and dry gardens in Japan</strong> echo the connection of the natural and spirit world. They are designed to create both a sense of integration between the observer and nature and an atmosphere in which meditation can take place.</p>
<p><strong>Wet gardens</strong> contain stones, vegetation, and water, while <strong>dry gardens contain</strong> stones, vegetation, and representations of water. Water and stone represent opposites that complement and complete each other in Buddhist symbolism. The walled dry gardens at <strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> consist of 15 arranged stones on a raked bed of white sand, which is representative of water and purity.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2068" style="width: 572px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2068" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=572%2C381&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="572" height="381" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Wet-Garden-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2068" class="wp-caption-text">Ryoan-ji, wet garden<br />© John Lander Photography</figcaption></figure>
<p>The stones are carefully arranged in five groups so that the entire garden cannot be seen from the porch, and only 14 stones can be viewed from any other angle. The gardens were viewed as puzzles, or lessons, to promote study and meditation. Those who come to the garden to meditate believe that they will be able to see the 15th stone when they reach enlightenment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2202" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?resize=587%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="587" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?w=349&amp;ssl=1 349w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden-D.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Scholars disagree about the stones’ meanings: some theorize that the stones represent islands in a stream or possibly peaks of mountains, others state that they have no meaning and are just an abstract composition that functions to incite meditation. Gazing at dramatic natural scenery was considered highly beneficial to the human spirit and helpful in gaining enlightenment</p>
<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism</strong>. Predating this are philosophies and historical texts that are based around <strong>nature and the cosmos</strong>. This later influenced <strong>Chinese Buddhism</strong>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these holy men were <strong>drawn to the mountains</strong> to establish temples. Mountains also appear in art as early as the Han Dynasty as a looming background within a variety of themes and idealized settings.</p>
<p><strong>Landscape paintings</strong> would become its own genre by the late Tang Dynasty. This would also become a major theme for poets.</p>
<h5><strong>Plants and Animals</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Animals, both real and imagined </strong>also made their way into Chinese art such as<strong> serpents, bovines, cicadas, dragons, and phoenixes, along with vegetation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dragons</strong> are symbolic of <strong>male energy</strong>, while<strong> phoenixes are symbolic of female energy</strong> and illustrate the connection of the natural and spirit world in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Painted designs and pictures on Chinese porcelain exemplify this. Porcelain resembles jade and, when fired, would have a translucent, shiny surface. It was, therefore, highly regarded like jade in Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In Daoism <strong>tigers represent the ying and dragons the yang.</strong> They were also considered a balance to one another as the tiger is from the real world and the dragon is from the imagined. The tigers appear in Buddhism as well, such as jataka tales with other Buddhist figures. The Chinese dragon was reimagined from Naga the Indian deity or god of snakes.</p>
<p>Animals are vividly portrayed in <strong>art from the ancient Near East</strong> and appear as part of ever day life. They appear in flocks, as pack animals for work and travel, in hunting scenes, and ridden in battle. Horses were of upmost importance as both transportation and warfare. These scenes appear on painted pottery, stone that has been carved and in metal works.</p>
<p><strong>Wild animals</strong> were portrayed as powerful. <strong>Lions guarded royal doorways</strong> during the Urak period. Other creatures such as vultures, foxes, and bulls were also prominently featured. Wings, claws, horns, and animals fighting were all elements that provoked thoughts of danger.</p>
<p>Many of these great <strong>animals were linked to gods</strong> such as the storm god Adad as the bull. Other gods appeared winged.</p>
<p><strong>Domesticated animals</strong> were popular accessories in the Near East. In fact, many were first domesticated here including dogs, cats, goats, sheep, and donkeys. Camels would come later in the first century A.D. These animals appeared in decorative arts and in amulets showing that they were considered lucky and protective</p>
<p>Animals also appeared in art as <strong>a sign of fertility</strong>, featured in pairs, families and mothers caring for there young. <strong>Animals appearing in repetitive sequencing symbolize abundance</strong>.</p>
<p>Animals were also used ritualistically and were sacrificed to the gods and part of ceremonial hunts. Through this association, animals in art were part of temples, as too were the vessels used in such ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>Works crafted from ivory</strong> became increasingly sought after and were a sign of the elite. Vast collections have been found in Neo-Assyrian palaces.</p>

<p><strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>is an example of<strong> decorative arts </strong>that is both beautiful and utilitarian. Made of  solid <strong>ivory</strong> from the tusk of an elephant, the work stands <strong>6 inches tall</strong>.  Ivory was expensive, durable, smooth, elegant, and easily carved, making it a highly desirable material. This pyxis was made from the famous workshop of Madinat al-Zahra</p>
<p>Islamic art is not always <strong>aniconic</strong>, meaning it does not use animal or human form. It is religiously <strong>aniconic</strong> only. In non-religious or secular and for private use, representational images can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Horror vacui</strong>: literally means “<em>fear of emptiness</em>” and refers to artwork that is completely full of imagery. This decorative work is an example of this. The work is dense, overcrowded, and intricate, with no space for recession.</p>

<h5><strong>Politically Utilitarian</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Pyxis of al-Mughira </strong>was a gift to 18-year-old al-Mughira, son of a caliph, as a coming of age present. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is cylindrical box with a separate lid. The one has a <strong>utilitarian</strong> purpose, as it was used for cosmetics. Royal men wore makeup, particularly eye makeup, as a sign of status.</p>
<p><strong>Ivory objects were given to royalty</strong> on important occasions. Think marriage, birth, and coming of age.</p>
<p>Such works expresses the political authority of the Spanish Umayyads.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This work is decorated with four eight-lobed medallions. This is symbolism of the number eight. It represents the eight levels of Paradise. There are carved <strong>falconers, griffons, peacocks, birds, and animals to be hunted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Royal iconography</strong> includes courtly figures and lute players. <strong>Falcons</strong> were a symbol of Umayyad legitimacy and power. Date palm trees may allude to the lost Umayyad lands of the Middle East.</p>
<p>The <strong>two lions</strong> symbolizing the Umayyads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The inscription reads: “God’s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Power and Symbolism in Nature</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>power and symbolism of nature</strong> is portrayed and perceived differently by different audiences. In <strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong>, nature is seen as dangerous and antagonistic.</p>
<p>Mt. Fuji, which is usually depicted as large and imposing, is small and dwarfed in the background compared to the wave. This change in the presentation of Mt. Fuji symbolizes the power of nature and its ability to conquer. Even a large and imposing mountain is dwarfed in the face of nature. Two boats with faceless passengers are about to be toppled by a huge, dragon claw-like wave. This demonstrates the dominance of nature, that it can overpower even the largest mountains and humankind.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura</em>)</strong>, is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai</strong>. This is a <strong>polychrome woodblock print created with ink and color on paper.</strong> <em><strong>Part of the Series: Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuj</strong></em>i it measures 10 by 14 inches.</p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as The Great Wave. Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5>Content</h5>
<p><em><strong>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> is a Japanese seascape <strong><em>Ukiyo-e print</em></strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The color palette is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> is a part of the series, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play, The Great Wave stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>The apparent symbolism <strong>points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the Ukiyo-e print represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by Hokusai. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, The Great Wave was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the ukiyo-e technique.</p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p>Hokusai has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term Ukiyo-e means the floating world, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. Ukiyo-e prints were recognized by their emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>
<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in The Great Wave.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><em><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</strong></em> was created as one of the thirty-six prints by Japanese <strong><em>artist Katsushika Hokusai</em></strong>. Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in The Great Wave, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><em><strong>Setting</strong></em></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Political Emphasis</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Neo-Confucianism</strong> also had political emphasis. Families emphasized loyalty to the king as part of loyalty to the family, and this was echoed in artworks. <strong><em>The Portrait of Sin Sukju</em></strong> was a propagandistic painting on silk that demonstrated Sin Sukju as a powerful prime minister in Korea. It also contrasts the vegetal and landscape views in <strong><em>Travelers among Mountains and Stream</em></strong>s by using figural imagery, depicting Sin Power and Authority</p>

<h5><strong>Power and Authority</strong></h5>
<p>Power and authority were demonstrated by patrons <strong>through the sculptures of Buddha</strong> in both the <strong>Longmen caves and the Daibutsuden temple </strong>and in in the <strong>Todai-ji complex</strong>. Artwork and architecture is used to support government and political structure.</p>
<p>The<strong> Forbidden City</strong> in Beijing, China is an imperial palace compound and served not only as the home of emperors and their household but as the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government. Planned according to traditional Chinese principles, the city is walled and laid out on a rectangular grid with evenly spaced streets.</p>
<p>The balance and symmetry of the plan of the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> reflects ancient Chinese beliefs about the harmony of the universe and emphasize the emperor’s role as the Son of Heaven, whose duty was to maintain the cosmic order from his throne in the middle of the world. The monumental nature of the <strong>stone, marble, and brick connect with the demonstration of power and authority</strong>. This provides a distinct contrast when compared to Sukju without any surroundings.</p>

<p>The <strong>courtyard style residence</strong> uses a <strong>geometric organization</strong> of space that is aligned with the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>Outer court represented <strong>Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the South.</li>
<li>Belonged to realm of state affairs and only men had access to its spaces.</li>
<li>Included: emperor’s formal reception halls, places for religious rituals and state ceremonies.</li>
<li>Hall of Supreme Harmony represented central focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inner court represented <strong>Heaven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the North</li>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>Eastern and Western sides reserved for retired emperor and empress dowager</li>
<li>Also included <strong>Buddhist and Daoist temples</strong> building during Ming Dynasty</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>The symbolism shows the relationship between Heaven and Earth. Emperor is the Son of Heaven and can mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>Power is conveyed visually and there is a spatial representation of power. This shows the emperor’s power over laws and regulations since he can regulate and reorganize nature.</p>
<p>The architects followed ideal cosmic order and social hierarchy in Confucianism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The complex was to showcase Yongle’s magnificence during turbulent years after the overthrow of his nephew. It was a visual assertion of imperial power with ceremonial space, ritual space and living space.</p>
<p>It was named the <strong><em>Forbidden Palace</em></strong> because only royal court could enter.</p>
<p>The complex was a political and ritual center for China for 500+ years. It was a place of power and propaganda that legitimized rulers and became visual evidence for the Mandate of Heaven.</p>

<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 North Gate (Gate of Divine Might)</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some key points about the <strong>North Gate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walls are 30 feet high to keep people out</li>
<li>Designed to withstand cannons</li>
<li>Gate from which troops would often leave</li>
<li>3 openings: middle one was reserved for the emperor only</li>
<li>Heavily guarded day and night</li>
</ul>

<p>This gate has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five entryways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest in the center was used as passage for Ming and Qing emperors.</li>
<li>The side ones are smaller and were used for officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-eaved roof is guarded by two pairs of <strong>Ming stone lions.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Mao Zedong</strong></h5>
<p>Today the gate is characterized by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong weighing 1.5 tons. Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two placards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: Long Live the People’s Republic of China</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrases have significant meaning as <strong>“Long Live”</strong> was reserved for Emperors of China. But afterward it was available to common people because Mao had liberated it…just like Forbidden City!</p>
<p>In 1989, three dissidents attacked the portrait with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests. They were sent to prison for 17 years (released 2006).</p>

<p>The Emperor’s seat is in here and was meant for grand ceremonies such as enthronements and weddings. From here, the emperor could establish cosmic order and mediate between both worlds. This is the middle of the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>9 main bays wide and 9 dragons inside (9 is a special number)</li>
<li>Bureaucrats and officials would gather in front of the gate at 3 am waiting for the emperor to walk by at 5am.</li>

<p><strong>The Northeastern section </strong>was a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. He planned to retire and abdicate, then settle down in modest quarters here, along with his major art collection.</p>
<p>This part of the complex is called the <strong>Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service</strong> and this room is the theater room. The layout mirrors the arrangement of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The finest craftsmen of the day spent <strong>five years building</strong> just this palace. He never spent a night here.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the palace was chained shut and largely forgotten. It has now been restored to what was imagined it would have been like.</p>
<p>If he didn’t sleep here, what did he do here?</p>
<p>There were <strong>gardens, banquet rooms, prayer halls</strong>, an <strong>opera house,</strong> and a <strong>theater room</strong>. It was a place to <strong>meditate, write poetry</strong>, and <strong>enjoy company of concubines.</strong></p>
<p>It was a simple rectangular room with translucent <strong>embroidered scenes</strong>, <strong>jade-inlaid wall hangings</strong> and <strong>Chinese carved decoration. </strong>There were also panoramic <strong>murals painted on silk</strong>, <strong>wisteria painted on ceilings</strong>, along with <strong>magpies flying over the tiled rooves</strong> of the palace. This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l’oeil</strong>). This was a testament to the emperor’s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.</p>
<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ming</strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant</strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.</p>
<p>The construction of the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son’s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).</p>
<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.  The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China.</p>
<h4><strong>Idealism + Politics = Propaganda</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>propagandistic properties of artwork</strong> also demonstrate power and authority, and the power of governments to regulate artwork. In 1949, Mao Zhedong came to power in China and encouraged artists to create art that conveyed Communist ideas in methods that were accessible to the masses and the new Communist state of China.</p>

<p>The painting <strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> is an example of the multitude of realistic oil paintings of workers, soldiers, and peasants that resulted from his encouragement. These paintings replaced the traditional ink paintings of natural landscapes largely <strong>due to the strict regulation of artistic production in 1966.</strong></p>
<p>At this time, the Chinese government pushed a cultural revolution and sought to modernize itself by destroying anything that resembled tradition.</p>
<p>Many traditional artists were humiliated and tortured, and their artworks destroyed. Younger artists <strong>created works that would be distributed by the government</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em></strong> became one of the most popular images of the Cultural Revolution in China.</p>

<p><strong>Japanese art is deeply interested both in nature</strong> (and the spirits imbedded in it) and the ways in which nature relates to humans.  This is evident in architecture, ukiyo-e prints and other landscape paintings.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Japanese islands were sheltered, or at least removed, from cultural and political exchanges with other regions</li>
<li>Never successfully invaded</li>
<li>1854: Opened to foreign markets by American Commodore Matthew Perry
<ul>
<li>Shipment of <strong>ukiyo-e prints</strong> to European markets (17<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> centuries Japanese woodblock prints)</li>
<li>popular themes: beautiful women, erotica, actors, sumo wrestlers, history and folk tales, landscapes, travel scenes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Shinto </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>beauty of the changing seasons has always been celebrated</strong> by the people of Japan. Each season brings its own celebrations and festivals. This is also part of <strong>Shinto</strong>, Japan’s native belief system and indigenous religion. It has been preserved in and has been part of the everyday fabric of Japanese life.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine Shinto</strong> had a close relationship to the Imperial royal family and was both a religion and a state. Sect Shinto originated around the 19th century and has 13 major sects organized by the founder or systematizer. Folk Shinto is based on Japanese folk beliefs. All three are interrelated.</p>
<p>Poetry and visual arts are part of Shinto. Kokinshu (A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern) is the first known works of Japanese poetry, and nature is the inspiration. Shinto paintings of the Heian period show Spring blossoms Autumnal leaves and winter scenes.</p>

<p>The work above, from the Metropolitan Museum is entitled <strong><em>Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons</em></strong>. It was painted in the late 16th century during the Momoyama period (1573-1615), in Japan. The work is<strong> a pair of six-panel folding screens</strong> with <strong>ink, color, gold, and gold leaf.</strong> The<strong> story moves from right to left.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Many paintings depict the transitioning of seasons</strong>. A theme in both Shinto and Buddhist art is the theme of beauty and brevity. For a more minute view of seasonal changes flowering plants and flowers become painting compositions. Decorative arts were adorned in the same way. Think ceramics, lacquerware and even kimonos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>School of Buddhism arrived from China in the 12<sup>th</sup> century</li>
<li>Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century via Silk Road traders.</li>
<li>It quickly became associated with the Imperial Court and the elite showed status this way.</li>
<li>Reject worldliness in favor of courage, loyalty, and enlightenment</li>
<li>Taught through introspection, not books</li>
</ul>

<li>Highly esteemed in Japan, particularly in form of printing</li>
<li><strong>Two-color and polychrome</strong> introduced in 18th century</li>
<li>Ukiyo-e prints (17th-19th centuries Japanese woodblock prints; genre scenes are popular themes: beautiful women, erotica, actors, sumo wrestlers, history and folk tales, landscapes, travel scenes)</li>
<li>“pictures of the floating world”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>

<p><strong>Todai-ji</strong> in <strong>Nara, Japan</strong> was created by various artists, <strong>including sculptors Unkei and Keikei, as well as the Kei School</strong>. Material <strong>includes bronze and wood (sculpture)</strong> as well as <strong>wood with ceramic-tile roofing (architecture).</strong></p>
<p>In the 8th century, this was the largest building project on Japanese soil ever. The construction was modeled after Chinese Tang architecture and <strong>sinification.</strong> It was <strong>based on the pagoda</strong> style and multi-eaved buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Elaborate bracketing systems</strong> were used such as <strong>complex wooden joints instead of nails</strong> to hold the building together. Large sturdy pillars helped to funnel weight to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Cypress Wood</strong></p>
<p>The Japanese have always had a close link to the natural environment and history of wood craftsmanship. An enormous amount of the material was required.  <strong>Cypress was the main wood used</strong>. It grows up to 40 meters, is naturally straight, has tight grain that easily splits into long beams and is resistant to rot.</p>
<p><strong>The main Buddha Hall</strong> used 2200 acres of local forest and it had 84 massive pillars. The wood had to be brought from many miles away and came from ten different provinces.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Place of worship for Buddhists and place of learning for Buddhist students</li>
<li>Displayed Emperor Shomu’s power, piety, and prestige</li>
<li>To unite Japanese clans under his rule, he promoted spiritual unity across the land that he was the leader of</li>
<li>Todai-ji was to be the chief temple of Buddhism in Japan</li>
</ul>
<p>During the rebuilding the Minamoto family was eager to present itself as national saviors who were pious. They wanted to seem morally superior to the Taira clan. Thus, political propaganda during each of its building phases.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Todai-ji</strong> is also known as <strong>“Eastern Temple”.</strong></p>

<p>What is unusual here is that the first and second story are of equal width.  Usually, the second story is not as wide. So, this is meant to impress.</p>
<p>It uses wooden bracketing that was constructed during the reconstruction. The wooden bracketing is from Song China.</p>

<p><strong>Nios are aggressive guardian deities of Buddhism</strong> that were originally a Hindu idea. They justify the force by eliminating evil.</p>
<p><strong>Nios are the Japanese version of vajrapani</strong> and are usually used as guardians at the gates of Buddhist temples. They are a metaphor for shoguns who will defend their Buddhist faith</p>
<p>The large-scale rebuilding in the 12th century created a multitude of commissions for buildings and sculptors. To fulfill demands, the Kei School of Sculpture emerged. This was the peak of Japanese sculpture.  The work was noted for the muscularity and dynamism of its figures. Sculptors such as Unkei and Keikei became famous.</p>
<p>The Nios are 26 feet tall, with powerful and dynamic bodies, in dramatic contrapposto.  They have bulging muscles and popping veins. The hair is pulled tightly back, and a sense of movement is created.  Originally, they were covered in black lacquer.</p>
<p><strong>Joint wood block technique:</strong> layered planks, hollowed blocks, lacquered</p>
<p>Documents were found inside the wood bodies about the patronage.</p>
<p><strong>Dramatic contrapposto: stances and symbolic meanings</strong><br />
◦ one hand up /down to welcome/suppress those with pure/impure hearts<br />
◦ the open-mouthed statue ( Agyo ) on the left, pronouncing the first letter of<br />
the Sanskrit alphabet, ah, meaning beginning or birth.<br />
◦ the closed-mouth (Ungyo) statue on the right, pronouncing the last letter,<br />
un, meaning the ending or death.<br />
◦ 1988, during their 1st restoration 1988 Buddhist sacred texts were found inside</p>

<p>The <strong>Great Buddha</strong> was originally created between 743 – 752 CE. It would have been complete in 749, but the snail-curly hair took an additional 3 years. At over 49 feet tall, it is Japan’s largest statue. It represents Vairocona Buddha the Buddha of wisdom and therefore must be larger than life.</p>
<p>The work was Commissioned by Emperor Shomu, and it required all the available copper in Japan. This was then mixed with tin to create bronze.</p>
<p>When completed, the Japanese court, officials and Buddhist dignitaries from China and India attended an “eye-opening” ceremony. An Indian monk painted in the Buddha’s eyes, symbolically imbuing it with life.</p>
<p><strong>Daibutsu</strong> is Japanese for Giant Buddha.</p>
<h5><strong>Buddhism in Japan</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century via Silk Road traders.</p>
<p>It quickly became associated with the Imperial Court and the elite showed status this way.</p>
<p>During the 8th century Emperor Shomu promoted Buddhism across the state and built Todai-ji for the Kegon sect of Buddhism (earliest form of Japanese Buddhism). This was part of a large building project where he ordered temples, monasteries, and convents to be built throughout Japan’s 66 provinces.</p>
<p>In the 12th century, during the rebuild, there was the Gempei Civil War between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto clan won as the Buddhists from Todai-ji had allied with them.</p>
<p>Taira clan burned the site in 1180 as retaliation. The destruction shocked Japan.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rebuild</strong></h5>
<p>The Minamoto elite contributed funds to rebuilding it and then looked like benefactors.</p>
<p>The Buddhist priest Chogen was placed in charge of reconstruction. He made three trips to China to observe what Song China was doing artistically.</p>
<p>In 1700 Buddha was redone.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Traditional Joint Block Technique</strong></h5>
<p>For <strong>wood sculptures,</strong> the joint block technique (yosegi zukuri-multiple-block technique) of creating sculpture was introduced, in the latter half of the 10th century. This was due primarily to the lack of large trees and a growing creative impulse to create gigantic statues. First it was developed for seated sculptures by a Fujiwara sculptor, Jocho. Later the Jocho’s style of statues was extended for standing statues.  Sculptor Unkei (1148 – 1223 AD) was well known for using this technique.</p>
<ol>
<li>A schematic drawing was prepared.</li>
<li>The center log was cut into a rectangular shape.</li>
<li>The head and body were roughly carved from a center block, and other blocks were joined to it by means of clamps and/or a peg system.</li>
<li>There were five basic ways to combine blocks of wood</li>
<li>Each block was split in sections.</li>
<li>To reduce splitting due to the contraction/dilation of wood the sections were hollowed out to a thickness of two or three centimeters.</li>
<li>The pieces are rejoined permanently, and final carving completed.</li>
<li>Final modeling and finishing are followed by a coat of lacquer or covered by a lacquered cloth, and coloring and gilding are added.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fewer knots and a thinner cross-section were preferred by artists, because these pieces tended to crack less. Wood needed to be dried in a controlled environment to avoid the exterior drying out, while the center was still moist. Shrinkage rates could also increase cracks.</p>
<p>Smaller trees could be used with this method, which was beneficial because at the time there was a lack of large ones. This also ensured speedier production. These smaller pieces were also more portable and could be carried back and forth to the off-site shop easily. Additionally, this prefabrication methods allowed for easier repairs of the statues.</p>
<p>The result was sculptures that were less expensive.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Pagoda(to)</strong></h5>
<p>Pagoda(to) is a tiered tower with projecting roofs. It evolved from the Indian stupa.  A pagoda plays a very important role in remembering ancestral spirits, and in religion.</p>

<h5><strong>Differences</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>One can enter a pagoda</li>
<li>One can only circumambulate a stupa</li>
<li>Pagoda is much taller than a stupa</li>
<li>Pagoda links people with the heavenly realms by reaching higher</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>The stupa traveled from India to China via Buddhism. It developed into a structure with layers and tiers that became taller.  This influenced the Japanese on how they both designed and built pagodas.</p>

<h5><strong>Structure of Wooden Pagodas</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>pagoda</strong> is usually built in a square plan. <strong>Each level contains 12 pillars</strong> and a heart pillar in the center. Earth is symbolized by the square shape, while the center is the “axle of the world”.</p>
<p>Some Buddhist temples in Japan still feature pagodas. These are usually <strong>five levels. </strong>This represents the <strong>five elements or the godai. </strong></p>
<p>These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>chi (earth)</li>
<li>sui (water)</li>
<li>ka (fire)</li>
<li>fu (wind)</li>
<li>ku (void, sky, or heaven).</li>
</ul>
<p>The eaves are heavy with clay tiles, so the <strong>finial or spire</strong> is used as a counterweight. It is made from copper or iron.</p>
<p>The <strong>shinbashira</strong>, is an element rarely seen in Chinese or Korean pagodas. This central pillar runs from the bottom to the top. It allows all floors to be able to sway independently. This is especially important during earthquakes and typhoons.</p>

<h5><strong>Stone Pagodas (sekito)</strong></h5>
<p>This is the generic term for any pagoda or stupa made from stone. These are always built with an odd number of stories. These structures are more solid than the wooden variety. Initially, these acted as a grave or monument. Now, these pagodas are garden decorations.</p>
<h5><strong>Types of Stone Pagodas</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gorinto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>five pieces of stone</li>
<li>grave marker erected for the departed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Muhoto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pagoda shaped like an egg</li>
<li>grave marking for Buddhist priests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hoto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pagoda associated with the Buddhist deity, Tahou nyorai</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hokyointo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>low rectangle with square body</li>
<li>used as a grave marker</li>
<li>images include Buddha, a Sanskrit syllable, or an umbrella with wings</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Gardens and Pagodas</strong></h5>
<p>In Japan, quite often pagodas will be surrounded by gardens. Ponds both natural and constructed are nearby. The gardens inspire peace and a time for quiet reflection.</p>
<h4><strong>(8) 203. <em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong></h4>
<p>Kamakura period. Japan 1250-1300 CE</p>
<figure id="attachment_2115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2115" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack.jpg?resize=990%2C60&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="60" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack.jpg?w=677&amp;ssl=1 677w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack.jpg?resize=300%2C18&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack.jpg?resize=666%2C41&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2115" class="wp-caption-text">Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace<br />Photograph © 2013 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</figcaption></figure>
<p>This work contains two images and is <strong>a handscroll using ink and color on paper</strong>. The handscroll was joined on their shortest side and <strong>rolled around a wooden cylinder</strong>. <strong>Each section was almost 2 feet long and 1 foot high.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Focus</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2112" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112" style="width: 984px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2112" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Details.jpg?resize=984%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="984" height="555" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Details.jpg?w=317&amp;ssl=1 317w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Details.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2112" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />Photograph © 2013 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</figcaption></figure>
<p>The focus of the drawing and writing in the Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace is on the battle scene. This emphasizes its violence, the skills of the samurai, as well as the luxury of the emperor and of his consorts.</p>
<blockquote><p>The text usually precedes the illustration, but in this case, it frames it. The scroll’s inscription summarizes the events. “It was more than horrible.”</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>The Ongoing Battle of the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>The artist removes the roof of the palace and places himself at an elevated “bird’s eye” observation point.  Here, he describes every scene in detail. This technique was largely used in <strong>yamato-e paintings</strong> and creates a feeling of peeking indiscreetly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> uses a continuous narration technique. The action moves from right to left in panels that are unschooled by the narrator.</p>
<p>A single ox carriage transports your eye in the whirlwind of carts and mounted warriors. The wheels of the cart are spinning, and people are trapped.</p>
<p>A few characters appear more than once. Note the courtier Fushiwara and the mounted Minamoto Yoshitomo with his samurai horned helmet tied with a chin strap. The main characters are seen pushing the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa in the carriage.</p>
<p>This work <strong>combines poems with drawings</strong>.</p>
<p>The artist uses a differentiated portraiture technique for the samurai heroes emphasizing their emotions and ruthlessness. Meanwhile the courtiers, and court ladies were depicted fugitively with stylized aristocratic dignified faces, lacking personality.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Going from right to left</strong>, the hand scroll offered a <strong>cinema experience</strong>. Your eye draws imaginary diagonal lines, while following the ox cart carrying away the captured retired emperor. The use of diagonal lines emphasizes movement and disentangles the viewer from the mass of the samurai killing courtiers.</p>
<p>The storytelling exhibits symmetry and relies on a crescendo to capture the viewer’s attention. It starts with a nicely decorated single ox carriage. Following the carriage, the viewer gets entangled among colliding carts and warriors.</p>
<p>The violence escalates. It culminates as the palace is engulfed by flames. Courtiers have their necks cut. Court ladies in heavy silk dresses are ambushed by arrows and chose to commit suicide by jumping in the wells.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2199" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?resize=872%2C541&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="872" height="541" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?resize=768%2C476&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After kidnapping the retired emperor, the samurai flew on their horses leaving behind a disaster.  In the end a running archer followed by a samurai led the rebels far away from the palace engulfed by flames. The samurai break free. They seem to draw energy from the violence they created.</p>
<p>Without any remorse for the wreckage, the painting celebrates the samurai’s swift and fatal power. It is the Minamoto clan (the victors) point of view.</p>
<p>The <strong>brushstrokes are refined</strong> while depicting the palace, the gateways, and people at the court. The <strong>brushstrokes become brisk</strong> for the horses and the samurai.</p>
<p>The dramatic moment of the battle is captured using vivid red and green colors. The use of black for the palace focuses the viewer on its veranda event in which the emperor is forced to enter the cart.</p>
<p>The painting is intended to be realistic. The attention to detail makes it a valuable historical reference.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A handscroll tells a story section</strong>, by section as it is horizontally unrolled.  <strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> gives realistic details on the conflict between rival samurai clans.</p>
<p>It was made in the 13th century to commemorate a 12th century event, glorifying the clan Minamoto and the Samurai in general.</p>
<p>The mounted armored archer and their war tactics seemed to illustrate the words of the Chinese tactician Sun Tzu (The Art of War):</p>
<p><em>In raiding and plundering be like fire…Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. </em></p>
<p>The facts in the painting happened in the end of the Heian period. The painting was commissioned in the Kamakura period (1185 -1333) and initiated by the Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo. During the Kamakura period the samurai were an established “knightly” class and Minamoto were the shogun’s clan.</p>
<p>The work also has documentary value on the Heiji Rebellion (1159-60). This detail-oriented painting provides precious information on the armor, head protection and weapons of the samurai, as well as the weaponry of other foot soldiers. Observe the historical references of the clothes of courtiers and court ladies. Also look at the architecture and decoration of royal gateways and buildings.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>hand scroll technique probably originated in India around 4th century BCE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Around the 6th century CE., it arrived via the Silk Road</strong> all the way to Japan together with the Buddhist religious scrolls and the Chinese writing system. It took almost two centuries for Japanese Buddhists to produce their own scrolls.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Night Attack on the Sanjô Palace</em></strong> is a narrative painting, called <strong>e-maki</strong>. It combines an illustrated hand scroll, with the sequential technique of the Buddhist scrolls, and the traditional Japanese painting, yamato-e, developed alongside poetry during the Heian period.</p>
<p>Initially e-maki depicted literary classics such as <em>The Tale of Genji</em>. In the military ruled Kamakura era, illustrated handscrolls often had a focus on “war tales” like this one. The action-oriented paintings or the ones detailing historical events were preferred by men. They were called otoko‐e, or “men’s paintings”. An entire set was dedicated to the events of the Heiji rebellion. Another scroll tells the story of Taira recuperating the retired Emperor and one is only remnants.</p>
<p>The attack on the retired emperor was insignificant, but the painting is a masterpiece of Japanese painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>The audience of an emaki was reduced. It is an intimate object that was held in the hands of the narrator who presented the story scene by scene to a small group of listeners.</p>
<p>With their exquisite calligraphy and paintings, generally done by official court painters, the emaki appealed to an educated elite, such as the imperial family, the shogun, or Buddhist monks.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>The scene takes place during the Heiji Rebellion at the end of the Heian period. This was known as the period of calm and tranquility. This is considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court. At the end of this era the sovereignty laid with the emperor, but in fact the power was wielded by the noble clans.</p>
<p>The Fujiwara and afterwards the Taira clan controlled the imperial court by marrying their daughters with the emperor and relegating the emperors to endless ceremonial functions. Japanese emperors reclaimed their power by abdicating in favor of a successor and relegating that one to conduct the ceremonies. Disputes ensued each time that the successor to the throne was chosen or an emperor retired.</p>
<p>By participating in all these disputes, the samurai warrior class steadily rose and made political gains throughout the entire Heian period.</p>
<p>In 1159, during the Heiji Rebellion the courtier Fujiwara no Nobuyori seemed the help of the samurai Minamoto no Yoshitomo to attack the palace. They started a fire and mercilessly killed courtiers and court ladies, in a bid to seize both the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa and his son from the power grip of the rival samurai clan, Taira.</p>
<p>Minamoto tried to control the emperor. Another scroll continues the story by telling how the Taira managed to regain control of the emperor. The continued rivalry between Minamoto and Taira led to the civil Genpei War, the destruction of the Taira and the establishment of the Minamoto Shogunate.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural context of the artwork(s):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong></p>
<p>The Bayeux tapestry is an embroidered (not woven) 70-meter-long scroll telling the story of the Norman conquest of England of 1066. It is a propaganda tool which tells the story <strong>glorifying the Normands and justifying the conquest of England</strong>.</p>
<p>The patron was Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, William the Conqueror’s half-brother. He ordered it to embellish the newly built Bayeux cathedral.</p>
<p><strong>Documentary value on the Norman and Saxon lives in the 11<sup>th</sup> century</strong></p>
<p>This was made shortly <strong>after the Battle of Hastings</strong> in 1066. The central panel of this detail-oriented embroidery provides precious information on <strong>the weaponry, armory of the Normands, on their fleet and cavalry techniques, but also on the royal banquets</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Ryoan-ji (wet and dry gardens) is a rock garden in Kyoto, Japan</strong> that <strong>measures 100 feet by 33 feet. </strong></p>
<p>It has a <strong>rectangular plot of pebbles, surrounded by low earthen walls, with 15 rocks</strong> laid out in small groups on patches of moss. Rocks are encircled by white pebbles which are smooth river rock.</p>
<h5><strong>Spotlight on the Rocks</strong></h5>
<p>The rocks are in five groups with 15 rocks in total.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 group of 5</li>
<li>2 groups of 3</li>
<li>2 groups of 2</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrangement of rocks leads the viewers’ eyes from left to right. Balance is achieved by small groups which create a rhythm and overall sense of harmony.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a <strong>Zen temple</strong>. It serves as a place of spiritual refreshment, contemplation, and rejuvenation. Since the elite practiced Zen Buddhism, this was a sign of status. It was used to incite meditation.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2069" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=944%2C607&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="944" height="607" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?w=330&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/207-Dry-Garden.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>dry garden</strong> was viewed from a temple deck as an exercise in enlightenment and acceptance. No matter what vantage point you have, you can only ever see 14 out of the 15 rocks. It is said that you can only see the 15th rock through attaining enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>The number 15 denotes completeness in Buddhism</strong>.</p>
<p>Buddhists maintain completeness is not possible.</p>
<p>If you TRULY accept that you can’t see the stone (that you cannot have completeness), then you become enlightened, and THEN you can see the 15th stone.</p>

<p>Visiting this dry garden is supposed to encourage meditation.  It is a place of contemplation and meditative practice for monks who rake the rocks daily into different patterns.</p>

<p>The lesson is that you can work very hard at something – and you should – but that it will be gone the next day. This doesn’t mean that we should work less hard but rather appreciate things while we do them and accept that they will end or disappear.</p>

<p>A wet garden is an Immersive and natural experience. Meditation and contemplation encouraged through strolling around the garden. The sound of the water and birds is meant to be calming.</p>
<p>This reveals the deep respect the Japanese have for the natural world, and the belief that lessons and enlightenment can be learned/attained through the natural world.</p>

<p>The wet garden has two small islands in lake. There is a small shrine on one of the small islands in the lake. It can be accessed through a bridge. This is a shrine to the Shinto goddess of luck.</p>
<p>Cherry trees abound on the island. The pond that attracts water birds.</p>
<h5><strong>A Visual of the Dry Garden</strong></h5>
<p>The dry garden is carefully raked each day by the Buddhist monks. These meticulous arrangements of rocks and pebbles are circled around each rock formation in particular patterns. It is unclear if these patterns have a particular meaning.</p>
<p>In 2002, a research team at Kyoto University claimed that the garden’s rocks, when viewed from the proper angle, subconsciously evoked the outline of a branching tree.</p>

<h5><strong>The Influence of Zen Buddhist Principles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Restraint, simplicity, and honesty are held in esteem</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Immersion in nature (gardens)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ryoan-ji</strong> was originally a Fujiwara aristocrat’s villa during the Heian Period. Later, a powerful warlord captured the villa and converted it to a Zen Buddhist temple in 1450 CE.</p>
<p>This was constructed for the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism that came from China in 1191 CE</p>
<p><strong>Zen gardens are a principal concept of Zen Buddhism</strong>, which was a type of Buddhism that the elite practiced because it required ample time in the day for meditation, gardening, tea-drinking</p>
<h5><strong>More About Zen Buddhism and Gardens</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Zen</strong> is the mainstream monastic <strong>form of Mahayana Buddhism</strong> in China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. <strong>The word means “meditation.”</strong> It was introduced to Japan in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. The Samurai class were the first to embrace it.</p>
<p>In <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong>, it is believed that anyone can achieve enlightenment.</p>
<p>It is also credited with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the beginning of Noh theater</li>
<li>the Japanese tea ceremony</li>
<li>a new study hall (shoin) style of Japanese architecture</li>
<li>Zen gardens</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Noh theater</strong> is based off stories where an everyday person is transformed into a superhero. Highly trained actors and musicians give stage performances dressed in masks and silk finery.</p>
<h5><strong>Kyoto Zen Gardens: The Moss Temple</strong></h5>
<p>In the beginning, Japanese gardens were highly influenced by Chinese gardens. Think lakes and islands with stones for accents. Then things changed.</p>
<p>Saihoji 西芳寺, Saihōji, more commonly known as Kokedera 苔寺, is one of Kyoto, Japan’s Unesco World Heritage Sites.  The word Kokedera means moss temple. Here is how it began.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2229" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Moss-Garden.jpg?resize=740%2C416&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Moss-Garden.jpg?w=740&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Moss-Garden.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In 1339, a Zen master <strong>Muso Soseki</strong> transformed a Buddhist temple into a Zen monastery. A traditional Heian pond was created with some rock islands or a wet garden. Then, he crafted a dry garden with three rock islands. It was all representational. One rock symbolized a turtle. The flat rocks were considered meditation rocks. Granite rocks were layered into what looked like a waterfall.</p>
<p>The garden was not kept up and later moss grew all around, forming what looked like a lake. Today, it is estimated that there are 120 different types of moss growing in the gardens.</p>
<p>Visitors can participate in the temple’s religious activities. This involves kito and shakyo. Kito is the copying of Buddhist scriptures, and low writing desks are provided. Shakyo involves chanting, which is guided by a monk.</p>
<h5><strong>The Gardens of Japan</strong></h5>
<p>Originally from Kamukura, <strong>Muso Soseki</strong> made some of the most important gardens in his time in and around Kyoto. Between the 12th and 14th century, Kamakura was the capital of Japan. It was governed by the Samurai. Many gardens were built around a huge Zen temple called Kamakura Gozan or Five Mountains. This beautiful setting was known for its bay and expansive mountains. This region also made good use of vast farmlands.</p>
<p>Kyoto too had a long history of gardens for its aristocratic and dynastic cultures. The lifestyle here was different. Boating was popular.  Pond gardens and blossoming cherry trees provided a beautiful background.</p>
<h5><strong>Karesansui</strong></h5>
<p>Karesansui is a Japanese garden style which represents the abstracted natural landscape mainly by rock compositions. Early karesansui in the 13th century was built on a hillside. Many gardens in Kamakura gardens have this style. Later karensansui in the 15th and 16th century was built on flatlands using mountains as a backdrop. Many Kyoto gardens have this style.</p>
<p>Ryoan-ji garden once used borrowed scenery from the far away Mt. Otokoyama. Then, it added a low fence to create more dimension. Minimum elements, deck, stone edges, sand, and rock add to this.</p>
<p>Later design techniques became more sophisticated pertaining to rock composition, layout of steppingstones, and even the materials used.</p>
<h5><strong>What are some of the main characteristics of a Kamakura garden? </strong></h5>
<p>Kamakura is boarded by mountains on all three sides, so this was incorporated into the gardens. This technique is called borrowed scenery or incorporating background landscapes into garden compositions. No fences were used so that the gardens blended in seamlessly.</p>
<p>Texture and color of the background played a part in composition. Gardens had to work with the natural topography and most run through valleys.</p>
<p>Early Zen temples in Kamakura incorporated ponds into gardens. These would later fuse into tea style gardens.</p>
<h5><strong>What are some of the main characteristics of a Kyoto garden?</strong></h5>
<p>Kyoto is a flatland surrounded by mountains. This provided flat gardens in an urban setting. The borrowed scenery was from the very distant mountains. Water from these mountains helped to form natural ponds.</p>
<h5><strong>Differences</strong></h5>
<p>Kamukura and Kyoto styles differ due to topography and climate.</p>
<p>The dynamic relation with a natural landscape is one of the characteristics of Kamakura gardens. It makes a significant difference between Kamakura gardens and later karesanui gardens in Kyoto.</p>
<h5><strong>Similarities</strong></h5>
<p>There are interesting similarities between Kamakura gardens and Kyoto gardens in the later period like Japanese tea gardens and the Shugaku-in garden.</p>
<p>Zen monks brought the tradition of cultivating tea from China to Japan during the very early Kamakura period (1185-1333). Monks first used a tearoom, before a whole tea house was constructed. Gardens were part of the overall ambience.</p>
<p>Shūgaku-in is comprised of three gardens connected by gravel paths. These wind through vegetables paths and fields of rice.  There is the upper garden, middle garden, and upper garden. Emperor Gomizuno-o (1596-1680) built these gardens as a retreat just outside of Kyoto.</p>

<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> by artist Ogata Korin was created using <strong>ink, watercolor, and gold leaf on paper</strong>. Each stand <strong>5 feet tall by 5 feet and 6 inches wide</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Beauty of the Form </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Two paired paper panels</li>
<li>Composition fills screen but is a simplified composition</li>
<li>Pared image down to the essentials to magnify important parts</li>
<li>Use of negative space (gold)</li>
<li>Abstraction/simplification and naturalism exist together</li>
<li>Background: subtle grid of gold leaf</li>
<li>Space tips upward</li>
<li>Patterned design of river shows movement</li>
<li>Serpentine contour of lake</li>
<li>Interplay of color, form, texture</li>
<li>New method: tarashikomi (tear-a-she-KO-me) blended different colors together while the bottom layer was still wet (this is the European method of wet-on-wet&#8211;just the Japanese version.)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>White and Red Plum Blossoms</em></strong> is a meditation on the transience of nature. It is the old versus new and a lesson of human existence. What was new will become old. Yet, there are merits to each part of life.</p>
<p>This work also contributes to an aesthetic pleasure. To decorate for one’s house in such an expensive way shows signs of status.</p>
<p>Folding screens were popular forms of art and interior décor.</p>
<h5><strong>The Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are two folding screens.</p>
<p>On the left the white plum tree grows off the paper. It is an older tree that bends downward. It flowers with a calm, mature, stable wisdom.</p>

<p>Traditional Images of Inspiration</p>
<p>It was common in Japan to use traditional images of nature to inspire meditation, contemplation, and a source of healing.</p>
<h5><strong>Rimpa Artists and Works</strong></h5>
<p>In the 19th century, art historians termed artists like Korin “Rimpa” which literally means School of Korin.</p>
<h5><strong>Rimpa work is characterized by:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>abstraction + naturalism</li>
<li>simplified compositions</li>
<li>sensuality in how the paint is applied with the tarashikomi method</li>
<li>Rimpa artists develop tarashikomi (wet on wet technique of applying and mixing paint; creates a swirly look)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Rimpa artists were inspired by:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>textiles (remember Korin’s family background)</li>
<li>ceramics</li>
<li>lacquerware which was all decorated in a traditional Japanese patterned manner</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Favourite scenes included:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Passage of time</li>
<li>Seasons</li>
<li>Japanese literature (example: Tale of Genji – story of Heian Era extravagance)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ogata Korin (1658-1868)</strong> was the son of a merchant family who dealt in fabrics, and textiles for kimonos. Their clients included samurai and nobility. The family owned a lot of art by artists who used traditional Japanese flattening and decorative patterns. The artist was inspired by this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa </em></strong><strong>(Kanagawa oki nami ura),</strong> is an artwork by Japanese artist <strong>Katsushika Hokusai. </strong></p>
<p>This is a<strong> polychrome woodblock print </strong>created with<strong> ink and color on paper. Part of the Series: <em>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em> </strong>it measures<strong> 10 by 14 inches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave Off Kanagawa</em></strong> is one of the most popular woodblock prints in the world. Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em>.</strong> Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled <em>Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji</em>.</p>
<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.</p>
<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.</p>
<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under The Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is a Japanese seascape <strong>Ukiyo-e print</strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.</p>
<p>The <strong>color palette</strong> is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Great Wave</em> is a part of the series</strong>, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play<strong><em>, The Great Wave</em></strong> stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>The apparent <strong>symbolism points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism</strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the <strong>Ukiyo-e print</strong> represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of <strong>a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang</strong>, the two opposites.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by <strong>Hokusai</strong>. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, <strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong> was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the <strong>ukiyo-e technique.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques</strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Dispaly of Emotion</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Hokusai</strong> has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.</p>
<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term <strong>Ukiyo-e means the floating world</strong>, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. <strong>Ukiyo-e prints</strong> were recognized by their <strong>emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.</strong></p>
<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.</p>

<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the <strong>influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art</strong>. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in <strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Great Wave</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> was created as one of the thirty-six prints <strong>by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.</strong> Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai’s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in <strong><em>The Great Wave</em></strong>, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.</p>
<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.</p>
<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Japanese Paintings</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yamato-e</strong> painting flourished in Japan during the <strong>Heian period (794–1185</strong>). In the late 9<sup>th</sup> century, Japan stopped trading with China, after several centuries. Instead, the country looked inward. This was known as “the period of calm and tranquility,” or the Heian period. The court was at the center creating innovative new trends in painting and literature.</p>
<p>The term <strong>yamato-e</strong> literally means <strong>“Japanese painting”.</strong> This was a term used to distinguish Japanese painting from Chinese painting.</p>
<p>Japanese paintings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>tales from Japanese literature and history</li>
<li>activities and motifs associated with the four seasons</li>
<li>Japanese locales</li>
<li>Rich, rolling hills</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Heian Period and Onward</strong></h5>
<p>Later, <strong>yamato-e</strong> evolved to be not only about locale and content but also contained:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly stylized figures</li>
<li>Abbreviated facial features.</li>
<li>Paints and thick pigment</li>
<li>Clouds to hide and divide spaces</li>
<li>Blown off roof tops to glimpse inside buildings (known as <strong>fukiniki yatai</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Literature</strong></h5>
<p>One of the most famous Japanese novels ever written is entitled <strong><em>Tale of Genji. </em></strong>It was written by Murasaki Shikibu, who was a court lady, back in the year 1000. The novel inspired painting using the <strong>fukinuki yatai</strong> technique. This allows the viewer to peak in at a private scene.</p>
<p>These <strong>paintings</strong> during the <strong>Heian period (794-1185)</strong> appeared on <strong>screens and sliding doors</strong>. Such doors had a functional purpose. They divided rooms and kept spaces warm. Therefore, very few survive. It is interesting to note that these doors changed with the season with complementary images for winter, spring, summer and fall.</p>
<p><strong>Waka poetry</strong> developed alongside <strong>yamato-e</strong>. These poems are <strong>comprised of 31 syllables</strong>, either created with the paintings or inspired by them.</p>
<p><strong>Yamato-e paintings </strong>were also<strong> painted onto handscrolls </strong>and were <strong>called emaki. </strong>These works depict classic literature. Handscrolls were unrolled and read on low tables.</p>
<p><strong>Emaki </strong>were commissioned by the elite. Think the imperial elite, shogun, or monks from wealthy Buddhist temples.</p>
<p><strong>Emaki</strong> were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invented in India before the 1<sup>st</sup> century</li>
<li>Used for religious texts</li>
<li>By the 4<sup>th</sup> century A.D they were used in China</li>
<li>It took several centuries before they reached Japan—through the spread of Buddhism</li>
<li>Earliest Japanese handscroll shows the life of Buddha, created in the 8<sup>th</sup> century A.D</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Kamakura Period</strong> <strong>(1185-1333)</strong></h5>
<p>During this period new genres were evident. Now that the military was in charge, there was a call for narratives around new leaders such as the Japanese monk <strong>Shinran (1173-1263)</strong> who developed <strong>a sect of Buddhism called True Pure Land</strong>. Kakunyo (1173-1263) the grandson of Shinran wrote the first biography about his grandfather. This started the trend of including the illustrated story on handscrolls, and later hanging scrolls to be displayed publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Likeness Paintings or nise-e </strong>moved away from the highly stylized look and instead captured the attributes of a particular person. As poets were highly prized the theme of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, Japan’s very finest, became popular.</p>
<h5><strong>Muromachi Period (1392-1575)</strong></h5>
<p>Ink paintings from China threatened to overtake <strong>yamato-e</strong>, but artists from the Tosa School, the official painters to the royal court in the fifteenth century, kept these works alive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bamboo in the Four Seasons</em></strong> is <strong>a set of six panel folding screens </strong>using<strong> ink color and gold leaf on paper,</strong> in the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is <strong>attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu</strong> and was painted between the late 15<sup>th</sup> century and early 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Here the illustrations tell the story moving right to left changing seasons starting in the spring and progressing to the winter. Paintings that use the four seasons as a theme are referred to as <strong>shiki-e </strong>type of yamato-e.</p>
<p><strong>Tsukinami-e</strong> depict the changing of time as well, but through monthly cycles and nature is often intertwined with human forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Edo Period (1603-1867)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yamato-e</strong> continued to evolve and change during the Edo period. Now, the wealthy merchant class were interested. New painters entered the market. The same themes were prevalent with new stylistic elements. Other styles also emerged.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Decorative Rinpa style</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Artists created <strong>paintings, textiles, ceramics and lacquerware</strong> with vibrant colors and scenes from nature</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Wkiya woodblock prints</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Popular themes were Kabuki actors, courtesans, romantic images</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Theme for Chinese art: “Dynastic Power”</strong></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2157" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C558&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="558" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chinese-and-Korean-Art-Title-Page.png?w=1281&amp;ssl=1 1281w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>One of the most notable <strong>themes in Chinese art is power</strong>.</p>
<p>Power can be expressed in many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>political power</li>
<li>religious/spiritual power</li>
<li>economic power</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Displays of formal imperial/dynastic power are the most common – even in 20<sup>th</sup> century. Chinese history when dynastic power has ended, displays of political power are still common.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Confucianism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Began by Confucius</li>
<li>An ethical and philosophical system that creates an ideal man who respects traditional values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daoism (Taoism)</strong></p>
<p>Aims to find the Dao (“way”) through withdrawing from society into nature to achieve serenity. The philosophy was started by Laozi (Lao-tsu).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yin-Yang</strong></li>
<li><strong>Yin:</strong> female, soft, dark, wet, cold, passive</li>
<li><strong>Yang:</strong> male, hard, light, dry, warm, active, energy</li>
<li>Mandate of Heaven + Dynasty Cycle</li>
<li>Created an attitude of the desirability of tradition, permanence, and stability à art, just like political traditions and cultural hegemony, does not change</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Buddhism in China</strong></h5>
<p>Starting with the 1st century C.E., <strong>Buddhism brought to China new ideas about life and death</strong>, and <strong>new opportunities to assimilate and assert authority</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese rock cut caves</strong> were inspired, but different from the Indian rock cut caves. It preserved an assembly hall but instead of a stupa, it contained a Buddha statue.</p>
<p>There were Buddhist monasteries with a residence hall for the monks. The central hall (nave) was arranged to allow approaching the Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>The first patrons of Buddhism</strong> were Northern Wei rulers—a Turkic people ruling over the Han Chinese who saw in Buddhism an opportunity for consolidating their power and reduce the importance of ancestors’ veneration. Yearning for assimilation and control, the foreign rulers made use of Buddhist images for authority and power.</p>
<p>The rock-cut caves were decorated with sculptural images made after Indian/Gandhara models and with robes decorated with linear/abstract Northern Wei style.</p>
<p>The later Tang dynasty leaders Emperor Gaozong (650–685) and his consort Wu Zetian, who later enthroned herself as empress (684–704), patronized Buddhist establishments and <strong>encouraged the efforts of monks to acquire and translate Buddhist texts from India.</strong></p>
<p>During China’s golden age, Tang rulers <strong>asserted their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography</strong>. The official examination system enabled educated men to serve as government officials, and laid the foundation for lasting growth, prosperity, and cultural development in art. Think Buddhism with Chinese features.</p>
<p>From the 4th -10th CE development and flowering of <strong>Chinese Buddhism</strong> would later be exported to Korea and Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pure Land Buddhism</strong> focused on the faith in the savior Buddha Amitabha</li>
<li><strong>Chan (or Zen) Buddhism</strong>: meditation/mindfulness during daily activities</li>
<li>still imported new Indic and Central Asian practices : the devotion to the primordial Buddha Vairocana, new bodhisattvas, and the use of the mandala’s cosmic diagrams.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Funeral banner of Lady Dai </strong>is an artwork of<strong> painted silk </strong>that measure<strong> 6 feet by 7 inches long. This is an </strong>early example of painted naturalistic scenes in Chinese art.</p>
<p>During this time, we begin to see some of the Chinese 2D characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy black calligraphic line</li>
<li>use of red and black</li>
<li>stylized figures</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the earliest known Chinese portrait. Painted silk was a common and expensive artform in China.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was <strong>a sign of status</strong>, as painted silk was an expensive artform.</p>
<p>It was used to <strong>attract the spirit of the deceased</strong> to its tomb, where it could be properly started on its afterlife journey&#8211; instead of remaining on earth to bother the living. (This is like Tut’s tomb)</p>
<p>It was <strong>part of the funeral procession</strong> and was carried in front, before being draped upon her coffin.</p>
<h5><strong>Here is What We See </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical divisions</strong>

<li>Left: yin (female component = moon)</li>
<li>Center: yin + yang</li>

<h5><strong>A Market for Art</strong></h5>
<p>During the <strong>Han Dynasty</strong> the Silk Road trade was incredibly popular and wealthy individuals in China invested in art.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Lady Dai?</strong></h5>
<p>She was the wife of Marquis of Dai, a high-ranking civil servant. The lady died around the age of 50. Lady Dai lived in Han Dynasty which was the Golden Age of Classical China with a highly stratified society.</p>
<p>Only elites could afford elaborate rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>The Find</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2166" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/194-coffins.jpg?resize=602%2C284&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/194-coffins.jpg?w=602&amp;ssl=1 602w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/194-coffins.jpg?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The tombs of Marquis of Dai, Lady Dai and her son were all discovered in 1971. Lady Dai was put to rest in seven nested lacquer coffins.  Her body was found wrapped in 20 layers of silk. The airtight tomb was 36 feet underground in a clay lined and charcoal packed hole. (Charcoal absorbs moisture)</p>
<p>All the above led to a very well-preserved body. Her skin was still elastic, joints flexible, she had eyelashes and nostril hair. Blood remained in her veins, and all organs were intact.</p>

<p>She died of a heart attack. There were 138 melon seeds in her body which suggests she died shortly after eating the fruit.</p>

<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>is located at<strong> Longmen Caves, in Luoyang, China.</strong> Made from hard, gray <strong>limestone </strong>the largest Buddha<strong> measures 57 feet. </strong>These were carved<strong> in situ</strong> into <strong>living rock</strong> as <strong>high relief. </strong>Here there are 2,300 caves and niches that extends for over a mile.</p>
<p>The Buddha and bodhisattvas display a new, softer, and rounder modeling, as well as facial expressions. Vajrapani and lokapala display a more engaging and animated musculature, with forceful poses. These would have been painted in brilliant blues, reds, browns, and golds.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p>This is a place of <strong>Buddhist worship.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_2055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2055" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2055" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?resize=700%2C524&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="524" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/195.-C.jpg?w=442&amp;ssl=1 442w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2055" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />Used by Permission</figcaption></figure>
<p>The patrons were emperors (and one empress) and this was the display of power and piety of these people. Rulers wielded Buddhism to affirm their piety, superiority, and tolerance.  Specifically, this revealed the strength and spirituality of Tang Dynasty. It was a metaphor for political power.</p>
<p>This arrangement with <strong>Buddha in the center</strong> emphasized a correct religious order.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Tang Dynasty was struggling to balance bureaucrats and aristocrats, who consistently posed a threat to the emperors. For emperors to sponsor productions of artworks such as these was to show that there was a likeness between the emperors and Buddha. Thus, aristocrats and bureaucrats should be subservient to the emperor, just as bodhisattvas and disciples were to Buddha.</p>
<p>This sculptural arrangement intentionally <strong>mirrored the political situation</strong> – one person is supreme.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Buddha at Longmen Caves </strong>contains in total almost 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, more than 60 stupas, and 2800 inscriptions.</p>
<h5><strong>A Look at Fengxian Cave</strong></h5>
<p>The specific cave we are examining is called Fengxian Cave.  Here 9 figures pose as a group.</p>
<p><strong>From Left to right: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Bodhisattva</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Vairocana Buddha</strong> (Buddha who represents all the infinite wisdom in the universe),</li>
<li>Disciple</li>
<li><strong>Bodhisattva</strong></li>
<li>Lokapala</li>
<li>Vajrapani</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A bodhisattva</strong> are Buddhists who do not pass on to nirvana, but who stays to help.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrapani</strong> are Chinese guardians of Buddha, who wields thunderbolts. The violence is justified only if there is a threat made to Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>Lokapala</strong> are heavenly kings who watch over one of each of the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>There are many <strong>smaller figures of deities, monks, and donors</strong> surrounding the nine main figures.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Most of the carvings date between the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century and the middle of the 8<sup>th</sup> century (Northern Wei through early Tang). Wei had moved capital to Luoyang in 494 CE.</p>
<p><strong>Tang Dynasty</strong> was considered the age of Buddhism in China</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddhism and Confucianism each vied for power over emperors.</li>
<li>Many Chinese, Indian, Central Asian, and Southeast Asian monks traveled through Asia, spreading Buddhism’s messages.</li>
<li>Alternating periods of Chinese Buddhism’s popularity or lack thereof prevented constant flow of work.</li>
<li>Largest period of construction (and the construction of Fengxian Caves) was sponsored by Emperor Gaozong, and his wife and <strong>the one and only empress of China, Empress Wu.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Cross Cultural Comparison</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fengxian (Ancestor Worshipping Cave) Temple</strong> (673–75 C.E., Tang dynasty, limestone. Luoyang, Henan province)</p>
<ul>
<li>situated high above the riverbed, the array of the 9 colossal statues sponsored by Emperor Gaozong and his wife (future Empress Wu) <strong>dominate the Longmen site</strong></li>
<li>the high relief sculptures carved into hard, gray limestone are widely spaced in a semi-circle with a central monumental <strong>Buddha standing more than 55 feet high, pedestal included</strong>.</li>
<li>flanked on each side by a monk, a bodhisattva, a heavenly king, and a thunderbolt holder</li>
<li>depicts the supreme Vairochana (Primordial) Buddha of Mahayana Buddhism</li>
<li>the pairing of religious and military figures on either side of a large central Buddha symbolized the religious and military factions that together supported a strong ruler.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>an innovative composition</strong> in which the religious system mirrors the imperial system, reinforcing the Mandate of Heaven ideas with Buddhism iconism. The message is that the Tang emperor is the earthly representative of the supreme Vairochana Buddha.</p>
<p>The opulence, Buddha’s lotus position, the halo and flaming mandorla carved into the wall behind <strong>suggest the harmonious paradise of the Pure Land Buddhism</strong>. The clear and symmetrical ordering of the statues recalls a Confucian context.</p>
<p>Buddha, monks (arhats) and bodhisattvas <strong>display rounder and serene facial expressions</strong>. The heavenly guardians and the thunderbolt holder (vajrapani) are more realistic, engaging, and animated, with realistic musculature and forceful poses.</p>
<p><strong>Buddha’s features (iconography)</strong>: lotus pose, elongated earlobes, downcast eyes, a halo, and mandorla carved on the rock behind, Gandharan robes falling in concentric circles.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Fengxian (Ancestor Worshipping Cave)</strong> illustrates the <strong>Pure Land Buddhism</strong> which added mystical elements to the basic Buddhist teachings. This was popular in China and Japan. By living a moral life, through faith, trust, and a personal relationship with the (savior) Amitabha Buddha, believers reach the Pure Land a realm free of spiritual corruption, where it is easier to achieve enlightenment</p>
<p><strong>Buddhist symbolism supports the Mandate of Heaven</strong>, an ancient Chinese belief held that gods granted the emperors the right to rule based on their ability to govern well and justly.</p>

<p>The size of the stone figures announces their <strong>legitimacy, power, and life force</strong>. Just like Buddha they used to be living creatures, i.e. honored ancestors. Most of them do not face the ocean but look inland watching over their descendants.</p>
<p>The <strong>moa</strong>i are endowed with a <strong>spiritual force called MANA</strong>.</p>
<p>The carvers “awaken” the states from the compressed volcanic ash, insert eyes of white coral with inlaid pupils of red or black rock which makes their eyes staring. They are called “living faces” (Buddha’s eyes look down with compassion)</p>
<p>While <strong>moai</strong> slender arms are pressed close to the sides, Buddha’s hands and their codified mudras are an indication of his message to the world of believers.</p>
<p>They share elongated earlobes as a status sign which in Buddhism also translated in the willingness to hear the suffering.</p>
<p>Also, both statues have topknots.</p>
<p>Made of red stone the moai topknots are gigantic weighing as much as 10 ton.</p>

<p><strong><em>Travelers Among Mountains and Streams</em></strong>, by artist <strong>Fan Kuan</strong> is a work comprised of <strong>ink and color on silk</strong>. It measures <strong>7 feet by 3 feet and 4 inches</strong>.</p>
<p>This work has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisp brushwork</li>
<li>Painting on silk</li>
<li>Height is emphasized by filling up the composition</li>
</ul>
<p>There are gaps between the foreground, middleground, and background. This suggests space in between. Negative space implies space is moving backwards and receding.</p>
<p>Scrolls were selected by artists based on color and texture and usually have the title up on the top right.</p>
<h5><strong>Style Features</strong></h5>
<p>There are<strong> six components</strong> that Fan Kuan was taught by his master, as were many <strong>literati.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit/vitality</li>
<li>Harmony/rhythm</li>
<li>Mental concentration</li>
<li>Scenery</li>
<li>Brushwork</li>
<li>Ink</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>What was the Function of a Scroll?</strong></h5>
<p>Scrolls were expensive, a <strong>sign of status</strong>, and something you would display to your guests. These artworks were not permanently displayed. They were meant to be admired and studied but carefully packed away.</p>
<p>One can study the image, meditate upon it and generally slow down. This provokes the same response as gazing at a beautiful vista would.</p>
<p>There is immensity of nature. Man is dwarfed by nature. There is also beauty in nature. Men can get lost in nature and revel at its immensity.</p>
<h5><strong>A Display of Daoist Attitude</strong></h5>
<p>Scrolls could also display the <strong>Daoist </strong>attitude of <strong>Yin and Yang</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daoism was popular amongst the elite</li>
<li><strong>Yin:</strong> female; dark; receptive; yielding; weak</li>
<li><strong>Yang:</strong> male; light; assertive; creative; strong</li>
<li>The interaction of these complementary ideas is necessary to natural order</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Content of </strong><strong><em>Travelers Among Mountains and Streams</em>.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>A group of travelers with pack mules travel through the mountainside and pass along a stream</li>
<li>Qualities of yin and yang
<ul>
<li>Some parts are empty and barren (yin), others are crowded and full (yang)</li>
<li>Mountains (yang) and sky (yin)</li>
<li>Water (yin) and sunlight (yang)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gritty mountainside takes up 2/3 of the picture</li>
<li>Based on real geological traits (vegetation tends to only grow in fine soil and mountains tend to have deep crevices)</li>
<li>This is probably a constructed landscape (this was not seen as a lie or fabrication, but rather that man could create a perfect landscape)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>During the chaos of the Five Kingdoms period (between the Tang and Song dynasties), many scholars and artists fled to the mountains. Known as <strong>literati</strong> these people were disenchanted with human affairs and turned towards nature.</p>
<p>Scenes that depicted majestic landscapes developed into an ironically popular style in urban China. China elevated landscape paintings to an important subject for art, hundreds of years before Western artists would.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fan Kuan</strong>, was an artist and a Daoist hermit, whom very little is known about. He is famous for landscapes in the Song period, and this is possibly his only surviving work.</p>

<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em> </strong>a set of two vases made from<strong> white porcelain with cobalt-blue underglaze </strong>each stand 2 feet tall<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Porcelain</strong> is a very specific kind of ceramic that is hard, white, brittle, and shiny. It gets the name from Marco Polo. Porcelain is close to the Italian name for a cowrie shell, and he thought it looked as shiny as a shell.</p>
<p><strong>Underglaze </strong>means the decoration is applied to the surface before it is glazed. This makes the decoration durable.</p>
<p><strong>Parts of the Vase</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lip</li>
<li>Neck</li>
<li>Handles on neck</li>
<li>Shoulder</li>
<li>Body</li>
<li>Foot</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> are one of the most famous cultural specimens of Chinese porcelain art. As part of the collection of Sir David Percival, they received the eponymous title! Sir Percival was known to possess a vast collection of Chinaware. He bought 1500 pieces of china during the Chinese Civil War, in the early 20th century, from Dowager Empress Cixi. She sold them to gain funds for the war.</p>
<p>The pair of artifacts <strong>exhibit a far eastern and middle eastern merger</strong> concerning the shape and the motifs they manifest. The viewer should deliberately focus on this aspect of <strong>cultural exchange</strong>. At the same time, they have an inscription on the neck, which stands out vividly. The inscription mentions the name and date of the artifact.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The two David Vases are <strong>identical with similar forms, colors, and materials</strong>. Made from porcelain, they are supposedly denoted to the deteriorated versions made in bronze, which was prevalent in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
<p>The identical vases possess the shape of an elongated vase with a handle on the neck above the shoulder. The form has a cylindrical base that tapers inwards to acquire a balanced grip on the ground. Above the same, two moldings create initial lower sections. The main body of the vase forms an arch near the shoulder, which concludes with molding. The elongated neck, a bit lesser than the length of the main body, joins to the thick rim, forming the head of the vase. The <strong>handles are shaped in the form of an elephant head and trunk on both sides.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2170" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/204-Close-UP.jpg?resize=643%2C459&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="643" height="459" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/204-Close-UP.jpg?w=311&amp;ssl=1 311w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/204-Close-UP.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The artisans, maintaining the minimalistic approach, have used <strong>blue pigment on the white porcelain</strong>. The <strong>design </strong>of the vases is a <strong>blend of animals and decorative foliage</strong>. The lower cylindrical body is divided into equal sections comprising <strong>symbolic motifs.</strong> The following section displays <strong>floral motifs</strong> while the main body has a <strong>single dragon</strong> with an undulating body covering the entire circumference. Following the molding with a decorative pattern, the first section has the form of <strong>a flying phoenix amidst clouds.</strong> Divided by protruding partitions, the upper neck section has a pattern of successively repetitive vertical leaves. The head of the vase shows alternating floral motifs with foliage.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong> do not have a special function to serve because they were for the altar of a Daoist temple. However, they have a vivid inscription at the cusp of the shoulder and the neck above the band of the dragon. The inscription mentions the name of the official who commissioned these elegant pair of blue and white Chinese wares.</p>
<p>Porcelain was used to create the initial vases. They were then painted with blue pigment. Artists deglazed at the end, thereby increasing the longevity of the pigments. This process is called underglaze. Hence, the vases are still intact and continue to gleam the space.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Although the material of porcelain indicates the Chinese traditions, the visual elements are borrowed from the Middle eastern regions of art. The middle east Mesopotamia zone was an artistic hub that created many copper-inlaid-with-gold vases. The designs, apart from arabesque, also had human figures and inscriptions, which served as a document to the history of the ware. Hence, these traditions seemed to have penetrated in Chinese workshops with the Mongol invasion. The kingdom of Mongols had expanded over nearly all of Asia.</p>
<p>China was the lead producer of porcelain, and hence the products were typically known as chinaware. And, as it appears, the blue and white porcelain products are quintessentially Chinese. Some of the kilns made by China could reach 2200 Fahrenheit.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>Because of the easy to read and distinct inscription, we know that these vases were commissioned by Zhang Wenjin of Yushan county in 1351. Along with <strong><em>The David Vases</em></strong>, he also presented an incense burner to a Daoist temple in Xingyua (modern-day Wuyan county). Yushan county is situated 120 km from Jingdezhen, where the vases were apparently made.</p>
<p>The inscription descriptively mentions the professional background of Wenjin who was in the salt trade. He made these vases as an offering to the temple to appease the god for his sins. At the same time, he also wanted to protect his family from evil.</p>

<p><strong>The inscription reads:</strong></p>
<p>信州路。玉山縣。順城鄉。德教里。荊塘社。奉聖弟子。張文進。喜捨。香炉。花瓶。一付。祈保。合家清吉。子女平安。至正十一年。四月。良辰。謹記。星源。祖殿。胡淨一元帥。打供。</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><strong>Translation</strong></h5>
<p>“Zhang Wenjin, from Jingtang community, Dejiao village, Shuncheng township, Yushan county, Xinzhou circuit, a disciple of the Holy Gods, is pleased to offer a set comprising one incense burner and a pair of flower vases to General Hu Jingyi at the original palace in Xingyuan, as a prayer for the protection and blessing of the whole family and the peace of his sons and daughters. Carefully offered on an auspicious day in the 4th month, 11th year of the Zhizheng reign.”</p>
<h5></h5>
</blockquote>
<h5>Setting</h5>
<p>During this period of the 14th century, Mongols had captured the entire stretch of the middle east to the far east. This stimulated an enormous amount of exchange in art, culture, and commerce between the Yuan dynasty of China and the Ilkhan empire of Iran. The blue pigment or cobalt in chinaware was imported from the Iranian Ilkhan empire. At the same time, the form of the vases also reflects a similarity with the bronze vases, which was a popular art activity in the middle east. The motifs and the pattern were also a middle east influence.</p>

Architecture</p>
<p><strong><em>Forbidden City</em> </strong>located in<strong> Beijing, China </strong>is a stunning Chinese Palace made of<strong> stone masonry, marble, brick, wood, and ceramic tile. </strong>It sits in the center of the city<strong> on 178 acres.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the building is <strong>timber and brick</strong>, with sloping rooflines and <strong>glazed roof tiles. </strong>The emphasis is on traditional craftsmanship through the support of Chinese laborers. Tile roofs curve upward to allow light in and keep rain out.</p>
<p><strong>The Significance of Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Extensive use of <strong>the number 3</strong> and multiples of 3 are used throughout. There are <strong>three tiered roofs</strong>, and the <strong>staircases have 9 steps.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 3</strong> is associated with harmony between yin and yang</li>
<li><strong>Number 9</strong> is associated with divinity of emperor</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Meaning of Color</strong></h5>
<p>The use of color in the<strong> <em>Forbidden City</em> </strong>also has meaning. These are the four main colors.</p>

<p>The <strong>courtyard style residence</strong> uses a <strong>geometric organization</strong> of space that is aligned with the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>Outer court represented <strong>Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the South.</li>
<li>Belonged to realm of state affairs and only men had access to its spaces.</li>
<li>Included: emperor’s formal reception halls, places for religious rituals and state ceremonies.</li>
<li>Hall of Supreme Harmony represented central focus.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Inner court represented <strong>Heaven</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pointed towards the North</li>
<li>Private space</li>
<li>Eastern and Western sides reserved for retired emperor and empress dowager</li>
<li>Also included <strong>Buddhist and Daoist temples</strong> building during Ming Dynasty</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>The symbolism shows the relationship between Heaven and Earth. Emperor is the Son of Heaven and can mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>Power is conveyed visually and there is a spatial representation of power. This shows the emperor’s power over laws and regulations since he can regulate and reorganize nature.</p>
<p>The architects followed ideal cosmic order and social hierarchy in Confucianism.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The complex was to showcase Yongle’s magnificence during turbulent years after the overthrow of his nephew. It was a visual assertion of imperial power with ceremonial space, ritual space and living space.</p>
<p>It was named the <strong><em>Forbidden Palace</em></strong> because only royal court could enter.</p>
<p>The complex was a political and ritual center for China for 500+ years. It was a place of power and propaganda that legitimized rulers and became visual evidence for the Mandate of Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 North Gate (Gate of Divine Might)</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some key points about the <strong>North Gate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walls are 30 feet high to keep people out</li>
<li>Designed to withstand cannons</li>
<li>Gate from which troops would often leave</li>
<li>3 openings: middle one was reserved for the emperor only</li>
<li>Heavily guarded day and night</li>
</ul>

<p>This gate has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five entryways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest in the center was used as passage for Ming and Qing emperors.</li>
<li>The side ones are smaller and were used for officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-eaved roof is guarded by two pairs of <strong>Ming stone lions.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Mao Zedong</strong></h5>
<p>Today the gate is characterized by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong weighing 1.5 tons. Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two placards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: Long Live the People’s Republic of China</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrases have significant meaning as <strong>“Long Live”</strong> was reserved for Emperors of China. But afterward it was available to common people because Mao had liberated it…just like Forbidden City!</p>
<p>In 1989, three dissidents attacked the portrait with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests. They were sent to prison for 17 years (released 2006).</p>

<p><strong>The Northeastern section </strong>was a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. He planned to retire and abdicate, then settle down in modest quarters here, along with his major art collection.</p>
<p>This part of the complex is called the <strong>Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service</strong> and this room is the theater room. The layout mirrors the arrangement of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>The finest craftsmen of the day spent <strong>five years building</strong> just this palace. He never spent a night here.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the palace was chained shut and largely forgotten. It has now been restored to what was imagined it would have been like.</p>
<p>If he didn’t sleep here, what did he do here?</p>
<p>There were <strong>gardens, banquet rooms, prayer halls</strong>, an <strong>opera house,</strong> and a <strong>theater room</strong>. It was a place to <strong>meditate, write poetry</strong>, and <strong>enjoy company of concubines.</strong></p>
<p>It was a simple rectangular room with translucent <strong>embroidered scenes</strong>, <strong>jade-inlaid wall hangings</strong> and <strong>Chinese carved decoration. </strong>There were also panoramic <strong>murals painted on silk</strong>, <strong>wisteria painted on ceilings</strong>, along with <strong>magpies flying over the tiled rooves</strong> of the palace. This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l’oeil</strong>). This was a testament to the emperor’s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.</p>
<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Ming</strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant</strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.</p>
<p>The construction of the Forbidden city was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son’s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).</p>
<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.  The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China</p>
<h5><strong>Forbidden City Imperial Power and Authority</strong></h5>
<p>How can we attribute the art-historical period during which the <strong>Forbidden City</strong> was constructed? How do both the plan and the architecture demonstrate the culture and/or patron&#8217;s function and/or purpose of the structure?</p>
<p><strong>The Forbidden City </strong>designates the Beijing palace of the Chinese emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties who ruled China from the 15th century until the early 20th century<strong>. </strong>The planning of the imperial palace took place during the reign of the 3rd Qing Emperor Yongle and it was done according to the Chinese traditions.</p>
<p><strong>The city was rectangular</strong> just like the world according to Chinese traditions and its name “Purple City” corresponded to the central star of the Chinese sky the “small purple star” (the Western Polar star).</p>
<p>The plan and the architecture of the city <strong>reflect the ideal cosmic order in Confucian ideology</strong>. The imperial palace was planned on a north-south axis, with a parade avenue which crossed the whole city and connected the gates. The first two gates, the Meridian and Supreme Harmony Gates open to courtyards. The palace rules emphasized the segregation according to rank to <strong>underline the authority of the emperor.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Meridien Gate had 5 Portals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The central gate was reserved for the emperor.</li>
<li>The other middle gates were reserved for family and officials</li>
<li>The outermost gates were used for servants.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>second courtyard leads to three halls</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the Hall of Supreme Harmony, </strong></li>
<li>the Hall of Central Harmony, and</li>
<li>the Hall of Protecting Harmony.</li>
</ul>
<p>These halls belonged to realm of state affairs and were reserved to men. They are elevated on a monumental three-tiered white marble terrace. Their tiled roofs are two-tiered and their wooden eaves are painted in intricate patterns all demonstrating the power and authority of the emperor. The <strong>roofs are yellow which is the imperial color</strong>. Their ridges are <strong>decorated with animal ornaments and heavenly guardians</strong> and the more important the building, the greater the number of clay figures.</p>
<p>The <strong>roof of the Hall of Harmony is crowned with two huge dragon ornaments</strong> weighing almost 4 tones each. Here is where the dragon throne was located. The <strong>dragon symbolized the power of the emperor</strong>.</p>
<p>The three Halls are the last buildings in which officials had access. The rest of the city was reserved for the imperial family, which earned it the nickname of <strong>Forbidden City. </strong></p>
<p>The segregation from commoners and officials was complete and <strong>emphasized the divine role and duty of the emperor</strong>. Symbolically the outer South court represented Earth, and the inner Northern court represented Heaven. Only the Emperor as the Son of Heaven and could mediate both worlds.</p>
<p>The main palaces of the private quarters, the emperor’s Palace of Heavenly Purity, Hall of Union and empress Palace of Earthly Tranquility are also elevated. Most have two-tiered roofs and intricate caisson ceilings. The <strong>symbolism of the dragons</strong> continues in the inner court with the Nine Dragons tiled screen of the retired emperor palace.</p>
<p>The <strong>grandeur of the inner court surpasses the one of the outer court</strong>. The Palace of Heavenly Purity was so large and inconvenient for daily life that after Kangxi, the emperors chose to reside in a smaller Hall quoting their filial piety towards the greatest of the Chinese emperors.</p>

Interpretation of history</p>
<p><strong><em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan</em> </strong>was made by an<strong> unknown artist </strong>but<strong> based on an oil painting by Liu Chunhua. </strong>This<strong> color lithograph </strong>produced in the late 1960s<strong> measures 2 feet by 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>The work features a <strong>low horizon line</strong> to enlarge the figure and <strong>atmospheric perspective.</strong></p>
<p>It is painted with <strong>Western realism</strong> as it is <strong>modeled</strong>, in <strong>3D</strong>, has <strong>precision</strong>, and <strong>accuracy with form. </strong>There is realism of fabric, body, and landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Mao</strong> is idealized, luminous, lighter than the background so he stands out. When this painting was first made, he was in his 70s, but he appears much younger.</p>
<p>As for colors there is no use of traditional reds. Instead, <strong>purples, greens, browns are used</strong>. The symbolic colors were abandoned for realistic colors.</p>
<h5><strong>All About Color Lithographs</strong></h5>
<p>When an image is popular artists want to make prints of it for reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw image the with and oily crayon on a flat stone</li>
<li>Cover the stone with water. It is repelled from the oily crayon.</li>
<li>Cover the plate with oil-based ink. It is repelled from the places where the water was and latches onto the oily crayon.</li>
<li>Press the paper down on top. Apply pressure</li>
<li>To make a color lithograph, you would need multiple stones – one for each color.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was intended to be <strong>propaganda, emotionally moving </strong>and present an <strong>interpretation of history</strong>. It was made when Mao was not in a position of strength. He has found himself in this trouble because of the failure of the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>The point of this work was to help Mao regain power and mend the country. This was to convince others that Mao could lead the country again, like he had through the revolution, despite the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>The emphasize was on Mao’s grassroots beginnings and his inherent strength. It shows him as a revolutionary who was committed to championing the common people and doing what was right by addressing the lives of the working class.</p>
<p>This work was described by Communist party officials as a “model work”.</p>
<p>Mao looks the heroic, ennobled, aggrandized leader, who is honorable, successful, and determined.</p>
<p>The image was widely published in newspapers and journals, as well as reproduced in the form of posters, statues, and kitchenware. Some believe there were more than <strong>900 million copies</strong> made.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The strike hasn’t happened yet. He is brave because this is the dawn of a new day.</li>
<li>Heroic pose as he strides forward among lush fields.</li>
<li>The winds of change literally blow through the valley.</li>
<li>Chinese landscape now serves a new purpose – it shows the struggle of the common man and the beauty of China’s people.</li>
<li>Telephone pole in the distance associates Mao with technology.</li>
<li>Umbrella tucked beneath one arm, hand in a fist – he is superhuman, charismatic, determined, practical.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>In the early 1920s, Mao and other communists helped guide the 13,000 miners’ <strong>strike at the Anyuan Coal Mine</strong> to protest the treatment of workers and demand higher wages.</p>
<p>This resulted in higher wages, better conditions, an education program, and widespread support for the Communists. Mao emerged as one of the most significant and well-liked leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Mao ruled from 1949 – 1976.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Leap Forward (1958 – 1962) </strong>was Mao’s plan to industrialize China while maintaining the basic agricultural/pastoral structure of China. The “solution” was to have farmers create steel mills in their backyards. Millions died as not enough food was produced, steel mills caught fire and many other catastrophes. The plan backfires tremendously</p>
<p><strong>Mao’s Cultural Revolution of 1966</strong> continued for a few more years as a reaction to Mao realizing he was on the brink of losing power. Mao tried to turn frustration towards him into frustration towards the traditions of Chinese culture. Mao argued that his plan would have worked had it not been for Chinese traditions that stood in the way.</p>
<p>Mao mobilized peasants <strong>(Red Army)</strong> and together <strong>they tortured</strong> traditional artists, scholars, and professors, while they <strong>destroyed </strong>thousands of books, historical objects, and artworks (<strong>anything Confucian or Buddhist they could get their hands on).</strong></p>
<p>Mao encouraged artists to create “art for the people” that would convey communist ideas in ways accessible to the masses. Realistic images of workers, soldiers, and peasants began to replace traditional ink/silk images of landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Liu Chunhua’s</strong> image was painted in 1969 in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. Liu Chunhua was a member of the Red Guard.</p>

<p><strong>Gold and Jade Crown </strong>is a<strong> metalwork </strong>object<strong>, </strong>worn on the forehead, that<strong> measures 1 foot and 4 inches. </strong>The crown is lavish with ornamentation and elongated branch-like protrusions from which tiny <strong>gold discs</strong> and <strong>jade ornaments</strong> are attached.</p>
<p>The crown required very delicate and precise hammering as gold is a soft metal and jade is a hard material.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Works such as these were found in <strong>burials</strong> for royalty. Initially, historians believed this to be the sole purpose. Objects that were important in life were taken to the grave, but these crowns were also used in special and occasional <strong>ceremonial rites</strong> of the Silla royalty.</p>
<p>Silla used <strong>shamanistic practices</strong> in their ceremonies where Kings and Queens were significant players. The gold indicated the power of the wearer. A crown is also a visual marker of status.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbols and Meanings</strong></h5>
<p>Three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke a sacred tree that once stood. It is believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi. </strong>Jade ornaments symbolized ripe fruit hanging from the tree branches as <strong>fertility and abundance. </strong>The antlers symbolized the power and speed of a deer. It is a sacred animal in Korea.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries, Korea was divided into three kingdoms, with the <strong>Silla kingdom</strong> being the most powerful and wealthiest of all three.</p>
<p>Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced <strong>shamanism</strong>. This is a type of nature worship which requires the expertise or mediation of a figure called a shaman who can facilitate communication between the gods and people. In shamanism gods control nature. Humans are at the mercy of nature. The shaman intervenes on behalf of the people.</p>
<h5><strong>The Glitter of Gold</strong></h5>
<p>Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as <strong>a country of gold</strong>. Silla kings began to associate with gold and use it to identify royalty.</p>
<p>Silla was particularly famous for its craftsmen and items created out of gold. Through collections unearthed in Silla tombs historians have determined that kings and queens lived in large royal palaces, and wore robes of pure silk embellished with gold, as well as <strong>belts and crowns of solid gold</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2175" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Korean-Royalty.jpg?resize=388%2C521&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="388" height="521" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Korean-Royalty.jpg?w=388&amp;ssl=1 388w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Korean-Royalty.jpg?resize=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1 223w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Jewelry was part of the ensemble with <strong>earrings, rings for every finger, and armloads of bracelets</strong> crafted in gold. Royalty sat down to lavish meals that were served in <strong>gold and silver vessels</strong> and plated on <strong>gold plates</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>earliest golden objects</strong> unearthed were in the Wolseng-ro Tomb in Gyeongju. It was constructed in the last quarter of the fourth century. <strong>Two large pendants were found</strong> made of pure gold. At the top are gold hoops, from which fall long chains, embellished with delicate pieces of gold. Historians believe these were hung from a headband on either side of the forehead.</p>
<p>Later, <strong>six royal mound tombs provided further insight into the lives of the Silla royals</strong>. Dating back to the early Silla period, between the first quarter of the 5<sup>th</sup> to the first quarter of the 6<sup>th</sup> century the tombs each contained a royal golden crown. Hwangnam Daechong, a tomb measuring 80 meters in diameter had a crown with a matching belt, necklaces, rings, earrings, and vessels all made from gold. The fact that royal deceased were buried with the gold objects shows the high regard the Silla people had for the precious metal.</p>
<h5><strong>Two Types of Crowns</strong></h5>
<p>Two types of crowns were discovered.</p>
<p>The first is the <strong>conical cap</strong> (magwan), a small hat worn over a topknot. Originally, these were made of birch wood and crafted into a cone shape. Conical caps were worn on the head and strapped below the chin. Fine silk fabric was placed over top, with precious metal objects attached. These crowns did not survive, but the ornamentation did, allowing for historians to reconstruct what the crowns would have looked like.</p>
<p>The southern mound at Hwangnam contained a magwan made of silver and gilt bronze. There were also decorative elements to adorn it including a gold winged object, measuring just over 16 inches high and gold rectangular plates with discs of gold circles hanging from wires. Each of the rectangles measure just over 3 inches each.  While nearby at the Geumgwachong Tomb or Gold Crown Tomb, a golden magwan crown was unearthed, measuring 7 inches high.</p>
<p>The second type of crown is the <strong>daewag or headband</strong> style from which vertical elements hang down. These crowns are made from thin gold sheets and lined with fabric, to provide the skin with comfort. In the early stages the daewag was made of a high purity gold with a minimum of decoration. Later the crowns became highly decorative but were crafted from lower purity gold.</p>
<h5><strong>Belts</strong></h5>
<p>Gold belts were another symbol of Silla royalty. These were crafted from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leather bands</li>
<li>Gold plaques</li>
<li>Pendants</li>
</ul>
<p>The plaques were linked together and contained engravings of dragons, phoenixes and palmettes. Heart shaped gold charms were attached to the plaques.</p>
<p>Pendants also held charms such as knives, tweezers, medicine bottles, fish, and jade pieces.</p>
<h5><strong> More About Royalty: Queen Seondeok&#8217;s Reign in Silla Korea </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Under the Reign of Korean’s First Female Sovereign Silla Experienced a Flourish of Arts and Science</strong></p>
<p>The ancient Kingdom of Silla was ruled by a woman from 632 to 647 CE. Her name was Queen Seondeok, and she was Korea’s very first female sovereign.</p>
<p>The queen’s father King Jinpyeong ruled for an impressive 53 years between 579-632 CE. He had no male heir, and the crown was passed on to his daughter. When she took the throne, she also took the word <strong>wang</strong> or <strong>king</strong>—just like the queens in Egypt had before her.  Seondeok was the Silla’s 27<sup>th</sup> ruler. She inherited a prosperous fortune. Compassionately her first objective was to help the poor in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Seondeok </strong>was also a fighter. She refused to give up land the Silla owned. She sent a 10, 000-man army to rescue the famous general Kin Yu-Sin. He was being held by rival King Bojang of Gogurye for ransom.  The demand was for <strong>Seondeok</strong> to give up territory the Silla has taken. Seeing the fierce army, the king released the general immediately!</p>
<p>Silla’s neighbors were not without power. The queen had already established trading and cultural ties with the Tang Court of China. The two states formed an army. Yet, warring in Korea continued until 668 CE after the queen’s rule had ended.</p>

<p><strong>During her time Buddhism grew increasingly popular.  </strong>The queen saw an extensive building program especially when it came to Buddhist temples. While these were made of wood and did not survive, examples of stone pagodas still do.</p>
<p>The most notable work is the granite built <strong>Cheomseongdae</strong> observatory in Gyeongju, the Silla capital. It stands<strong> 9 meters high</strong>. The blocks are large rectangles set in a circular formation, forming a bottle like shape.</p>
<p>There is a window with 12 layers of bricks below it and 12 layers of bricks above it. The sun’s rays are captured during the spring and summer equinoxes, given its south facing views.  It was <strong>initially thought that the building functioned as a sundial</strong>, as astronomy and astrology were important parts of Korean society that helped with agriculture. It also lent authority to rulers as the chosen ones.</p>
<p>Another theory is that <strong>Cheomseongdae </strong>was meant as a replica of Mount Sumeru, the holy Buddhist mountain. This would indicate the sight was a place to worship and pray. The female like form could also mean that it was built to represent the Ishtar/Inanna who was connected to the heavens. One final theory is that it was suppose to represent the Queen herself.</p>
<h5><strong>Hwangnyongsa Temple</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hwangnyongsa Temple is a Buddhist temple</strong> which translates into English as <strong>Temple of the Illustrious Dragon,</strong> also in Gyeongju. Myth has it that a yellow dragon was spotted at this exact location, symbolizing the defeat of all enemies of Silla.</p>
<p>The project began with the breaking of the ground by King Jinheung, in 553 CE. The site measured 280 by 280 meters, with a huge Buddha at a height of 4 meters. The queen added a nine-story pagoda for which she hired master architect Abiji from Baekje. It also included a massive bell. Everything was destroyed by the Mongols in 1238 CE, but the foundation remains for visitors to see.</p>
<h5><strong>Death of the Queen</strong></h5>
<p>Not everyone agreed Seondeok should rule. Fuming aristocrats thought the throne should now be granted to someone outside of the bloodline. A rebellion ensued, that was thwarted by general Kin Yu-Sin and the queen’s nephew.</p>
<p>She would later die of illness and was entombed within the sacred mountain of Nangsan, Gyeongju.</p>
<h5><strong>The Second Queen</strong></h5>
<p><strong>After the rule of Queen </strong>Seondeok, her cousin Jindeok (r. 647-654 CE) took the throne. She would further help Silla dominate the Korean peninsula.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Goryeong Sin Family Collection in Korea</p>
<p><strong>Portrait of Sin Sukju</strong> from the <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> is a hanging scroll made from <strong>ink and color on silk. The work </strong>measures<strong> 5 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches.</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Korean portraiture conventions, court artists painted subjects in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-length view</li>
<li>¾ turn</li>
<li>Only one ear showing</li>
<li>With crisp angular lines</li>
<li>Little to no modeling; mostly using lines to show folds of fabric or skin</li>
<li>Highly controlled brushwork</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This hanging scroll was meant <strong>to be displayed</strong>. Silk is a sign of <strong>status.</strong></p>
<p>Sin Sukju (1417-1475) is depicted as a “meritorious subject” and celebrated as Prime Minister. He was an official honored for his distinguished service at court and his loyalty to the king. These types of portraits were common for government workers.</p>
<p>These portraits were cherished by families and worshipped for generations. This is similar to Head of Roman Patrician with a focus on ancestral rituals.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju is dressed in his official robes, with a black silk hat on his head.  He is shown as a Neoconfucian scholar. He sits with his hands folded neatly and concealed within his sleeves. Excessive fabric is a sign of wealth (think of Arnolfini Portrait!).</p>
<p>He wears a rank badge on his chest that was typically made of embroidered silk. This indicates the status of the official which ranged from emperor to local official. Images of birds identified rank. Sin Sukju’s badge shows a pair of peacocks amongst flowers and clouds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Sin Sukju was Prime Minister from 1461 – 1464, and again through 1471 – 1475.</p>
<p>The <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting</strong> was trained to capture the likeness of sitters, while adhering to pictorial conventions for illustrating government members. Imperial Bureau was the government school of artists that standardized painted images. Since images were so standardized, artists likely specialized in one area such as the face, hands, or robe.</p>
<p><strong>Sinification</strong> refers to the diffusion of Chinese culture to other regions. Koreans adopted not only Confucianism but also traditions of Chinese paintings. This was a sign of cross-culturation.</p>
<p>Notice the painting of a Chinese bureaucrat on the left</p>

<h5><strong>Contextual History</strong></h5>
<p>In 1800 &#8211; 1200 B.C. the Aryans arrived from the north. Then, <strong>Hinduism began</strong>. There was no founder and no set of tenets. As a polytheistic faith, there are hundreds, even thousands, of gods. This is a complex religion with practices, schools and beliefs. It is a life devoted to prayer, devotion and good deeds.</p>
<p>In the 6<sup>th</sup> century BCE, <strong>Siddhartha Gautama founded Buddhism.</strong> This became the dominant religion of Southeast Asia. Buddha is not a god but an example of leading an ascetic life. Buddhists believe a life of suffering ends when rebirth ends and the soul achieves nirvana.</p>
<p>Common symbols include the lion (as Buddha was royalty), the wheel (law) and lotus (purity)</p>
<h5><strong>Target Concepts </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Religions rooted in the East seek <strong>an end or escape from the karmic cycle or reincarnation</strong>.</li>
<li>Buddhism begins in India but spreads throughout the East.</li>
<li>Artistic and architectural styles were influenced by Buddhism.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction </strong>is frequently the answer when a culture wishes to depict the supernatural</li>
<li><strong>Iconography </strong>coveys messages in Eastern Art</li>
<li>Eastern Art has its own styles that differs from Western Art.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>An Influence of Artistic Styles</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Military conquest</li>
<li>the Silk Road</li>
<li>Colonialism</li>
<li>Trade in Buddhist Art</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> in <strong>Khajuraho, India</strong>, is built from <strong>sandstone</strong> and stands <strong>85 feet high.</strong>  It is one of the ancient Hindu shrines of India. Located inside the native of Khajurao, in central India, they are famous for their incredibly beautiful erotic sculptures, displaying several sex positions in the most sensual form. One of the finest specimens of temple architecture, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is made in a <strong>Nagara style architecture of northern India.</strong></p>

<p>Despite many foreign invasions, the temple has survived the wrath of time. The well-carved columns, plinth, walls, sanctum, and halls are worth noticing. They are living proof of <strong>semantic Indian art</strong> and expert <strong>craftsmanship of Indian artists</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2080" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-interior-closeup.jpg?resize=864%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="864" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-interior-closeup.jpg?w=726&amp;ssl=1 726w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-interior-closeup.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Males and females locked in sexual positions portray the deep knowledge that ancient Indian sages had regarding lovemaking as a concept of attaining spiritual bliss. Moreover, artists have sculpted human figures with accurate anatomy, denoting the system of research prevalent among the guilds. Owing to the temple being extant, the architecture and stone masonry are exceptional.</p>
<p>In the past, Indian art is an embodiment of abstract and manifest. The manifest forms through temple architecture represent life and its eventual surrender to the higher consciousness by refining the senses.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is a part of a bigger complex with many other shrines in Khajurao, a native village in central India. When it was built in the 10th century AD, more than 80 temples were constructed. These were destroyed by Sultanate rulers, post-12-13th centuries. Presently, less than 25 temples are extant, remembering the ancient artistic legacy.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2035" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2035" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-D.png?resize=900%2C607&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="900" height="607" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2035" class="wp-caption-text">Lakshmana Temple plan</figcaption></figure>
<p>Built on the raised platform, plinth or <em>jagati</em>, the central shrine of <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is surrounded by four smaller shrines, constructed in the same style. This pattern is known as Panchayantana in Indian doctrines. Notably, this structure reminds us of four minarets surrounding the famous mausoleum, Taj Mahal by Shah Jahan. The function served is quite contradictory in the case of this Hindu temple. As it is a Nagara-style temple, it comprises the main space called <em>garbha griha</em> or sanctum, which houses the god-statue of <strong>Lord Vaikunth Vishnu</strong>. It is a small, windowless, and no-contact, sacred space, where most priests are allowed to perform routine rituals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2082" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lakshama-temple-Khajuraho-labelled.jpg?resize=990%2C574&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="574" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lakshama-temple-Khajuraho-labelled.jpg?resize=1024%2C594&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lakshama-temple-Khajuraho-labelled.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lakshama-temple-Khajuraho-labelled.jpg?resize=768%2C445&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lakshama-temple-Khajuraho-labelled.jpg?resize=330%2C190&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lakshama-temple-Khajuraho-labelled.jpg?w=1242&amp;ssl=1 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Vishnu</strong> is one of the main gods of the Hindu pantheon, which <strong>symbolizes preservation and protection</strong>. The cult of Vishnu in India is known as Vaishnavite. <strong>Mentioned in the Vedas</strong>, he is a Vedic god and thus had a large following throughout the continent of India since the ancient past. Most importantly, Vishnu is the god who regularly incarnates on the earth whenever there arises a great force of evil.</p>
<p>Vishnu appeared on the earth through ten reincarnations which consist of popular gods like Rama, Krishna, Parshurama, among six others. In addition, Vishnu also appears in a variety of other divine forms, among which Vaikunth Vishnu is also a significant one. The god with three heads and four hands, is a powerful emblem of taking charge of the preservation of life and beings. The three heads represent three combined incarnations viz. Narsimha, Varaha and Saumya.</p>
<p>Facing east, the <strong>garbha griha</strong> is enclosed in a tall spire structure called <strong>vimana.</strong> Tapering at the top, the <strong>vimana </strong>symbolizes refinement of human senses to achieve supreme bliss and union with God. The sanctum connects to an alley called <strong>antarala</strong>, which is a connecting bridge to the sacred space with a secular one.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>The sacred space of <strong>garbha griha</strong> opens to a hall with many decorative columns, in hypostyle format, which is called <strong>mandapa</strong>.</p>
<p>There are categories to <strong>mandapa,</strong> which comprise <strong>ardhamandapa</strong> and <strong>sabhamandapa</strong>,<em> </em>concerning the performed activities. These activities include religious duties, chanting, singing hymns in the praise of gods and goddesses, among others. <strong>Mandapa</strong><em> </em>is a secular space, where every layman is allowed to visit and pray.</p>
<p>The interior of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong> is made with corbeled arch, a style of overlapping masonry, which is pressured on the ground for stability. This is known as <strong>Ashlar masonry</strong> with stones fitted using rivets instead of mortar or nails. Artists have used <strong>horror vacui</strong>, defining the profuse decoration on the outside walls. Significantly, the southern walls of the temple show intimate sexual poses of a male-female union.</p>
<p>The temple sculpture in ancient India followed the aesthetics of <strong>rasa</strong> (acquiring relish) and <strong>Taalmana</strong><em> </em>(proportion) to create evocative artworks. Hence, the figures are curvy, tall, slender, and extremely rhythmic. Moreover, they are lyrical, moving the gaze subtly and effectively. Artists were able to achieve this remarkable feat of precision because of <strong>sandstone, which is soft and workable</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2034" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2034" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?resize=750%2C502&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="502" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/200-C.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2034" class="wp-caption-text">Detail<br />© Michele Burgess/Alamy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from erotic couples called <strong>mithuna,</strong> there are high reliefs of over 600 gods from Hindu pantheons. The short capitals show the form of lions, while before a devotee circumambulates the temple, the statue of Lord Ganesha assures of the correct revolving path. Significantly, in India, Lord Ganesha is worshipped by all creeds before initiating a new chapter of life. The human figurines are adorned with many accessories denoting royalness.</p>
<p>The interior of the Lakshmana Temple is equally decorated with the narration of the lives of gods. Incarnations of Vishnu, Krishna Leela (tale), among many other narrative panels enliven the temple with the traditional culture of India. Based on Indian aesthetic theories, the placement of sculptures allots figures of speech (<em>alamkara</em>) quality. Hence, they suggest an abstract philosophy over describing it through inscriptions. The aesthetics of suggestions in Indian aesthetic theory is called <em>dhvani</em>. Through love-making scenes on the temple, the importance of sex as a means to higher consciousness is emphasized by the ruling dynasty of Chandella.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Primarily, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple serves as the worshipping place of Lord Vishnu</strong>. The Hindu temples are deemed as a residing space for the god among the common masses. Visiting the temple, the devotee circumambulates the shrine to activate the divine energy and pay symbolic reverence and dedication. Most importantly, they should circumambulate in a clockwise direction.</p>
<p>The Chandella kingdom followed the Vaishnaivite cult and to address social legitimacy, they built many temples. It also showed their piety. With respect to political agenda, they would often borrow the model of deity from the neighboring kingdom to maintain the cordial relation. In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple,</strong> king Yashovarman had followed the same method. However, it is stated that the present idol in the temple is not an original one.</p>
<p>Rulers are depicted in tantric sex poses, which were seen as a kind of offering to the deities. The theme of the building is preservation (this is what Vishnu embodies): whether it be sexual prolonging or preservation of human life (through reproduction).</p>
<p>The ancient Indian temples are solid proof of profound study, which are documented in the doctrines called <strong>shastras.</strong> From the studies in the science of construction to the study of making love is practically demonstrated and celebrated in these documents.</p>
<p>With respect to the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, the legacy of architecture and art is combined with tantric philosophy, which presents a spiritual significance to sex. According to Tantrism, the union of the male and female body develops proximity with god.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Shilpashashtra and Kamasutra are ancient Indian texts on the art of sculpting and lovemaking, respectively. The main architect of the temple is known as Sutradhar or a Vishwakarma, a person who designs and directs the construction. Indian traditional doctrines are also replete with information to plan the building, as well as instructions to create a sculpture concerning the essential aesthetics. These structures of information have proven to be textbooks to the generation of artists in making high-relief or free-standing sculptures. Majorly, the narratives have been borrowed from ancient texts like Vedas, Puranas, and epics.</p>
<p>Presenting a Vaikunth Vishnu idol in the sanctum, the Chandela kings propagated Vaisnavism. However, they also promoted Jainism and had also supported the construction of Jain temples.</p>
<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>Yashvoraman, a Chandella king, in 930 AD, augmented the construction of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, which eventually was completed during his son’s rule. A guild of artists was employed to finish the massive plan of the temple. Concerning the ruler’s desire to stand it out from the rest, a few changes were observed.</p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple</strong>, the notion of sculpting erotic poses on the junctures was novel and performed for the first time. It is an example of using one of the figures of speech (<em>alamkara</em>) called <em>slesha </em>or pun. The temple was and is open to the visitors to seek the blessings of the preserver deity, Vishnu. It is one of the world heritage sites of India.</p>
<h5><strong>Setting</strong></h5>
<p>Lakshmana temple was constructed between 930 &#8211; 1050 CE. Yashovarman of the Chandella dynasty built many temples in Khajurao with an exemplary amount of exterior as well as interior decoration. Thus, it initiated the nomenclature of Chandela art and architecture with specific significance. Moreover, Khajurao was the capital of the kingdom that boasts many cultural sites.</p>
<p>During the 10th century AD, the history of India had witnessed many falls and the rise of successful empires. Thus, the heritage was becoming predominant had followed a set of established rules. Many other kingdoms prevailed with final successive rules of Pala kingdom in the east and Chola kingdom in the south, among others, who proved great patronage to art and architecture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance</em></strong><em> </em>or the famous <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong><em> </em>sculpture epitomizes the manifestation of divine and cosmic energy. It is an absolute artistic representation of the <strong>golden age of sculpture in India</strong> and made from <strong>bronze</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Focus</strong></h5>
<p>The viewer must train the eye to look beyond the mere dancing pose and try and grasp the deeper meanings of symbolic gestures and forms. Although <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> is shown in an effeminate dancing pose, it is a <strong>symbiotic form of male and female energy</strong>. With one leg lifted, knee bent, and a hand crossing over the chest, the lyrical composition brings attention to the cosmic rhythm of the universe.</p>
<p>Etymologically, in Nataraja, <em>nat </em>means dance, and <em>raja </em>denotes the king. <strong><em>Narteswar</em></strong> and <strong><em>Natesa</em></strong> are two other names attributed to this sculpture.</p>
<p>As one of the Hindu pantheon’s top three gods, <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> is mentioned as a destroyer of the world, wherein he serves as an agent to initiate the process of new creation. That is why he is <strong>one of the most revered gods in India</strong>. Presenting primordial rhythm and sound, Natraja or Shiva as Lord of Dance amplifies two critical events of universal life: <strong>birth and death</strong>. As he performs the dance called <strong>Tandava,</strong> he is annihilating the present world with utmost calm composure.</p>
<p>As the most popular Indian sculpture, an emblem of worship and religiosity, <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> <strong>symbolizes fearlessness, the defeat of evil, peace, wisdom, and immense knowledge</strong>. A cultural motif, different regions and timelines have depicted the Natraja in various styles, each showing a different number of hands of Shiva.</p>
<h5><strong>The Visual Elements</strong></h5>
<p>Each motif or the form in the Natraja is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2084" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?resize=875%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="875" height="567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?w=875&amp;ssl=1 875w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Close-Up.jpg?resize=768%2C498&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The arch surrounding the Shiva shows flames that originate from the mouth of the creature called <strong>Makara</strong>, a mythical sea creature, at the base. Thus, the encircling <strong>nimbus represents</strong> a cosmic circle of fire. This denotes the never-ending cycle of creation and destruction—a cogent Hindu belief. This nimbus or halo is known as the <em>Prabha mandala</em>. Interestingly, the earlier Natraja idols had an arch while later transformed into a fully circular halo. As he is ecstatically dancing, the flying locks of Shiva fan around, touching the nimbus.</p>
<p>The <strong>headdress</strong> consists of a skull, and a flower named Datura metel, denoting death as the ultimate truth and fragrance of life, respectively. Mounted with a crescent moon and the goddess <strong>Ganga</strong>, it indicates a peaceful state of mind despite the impending termination of life that everyone is destined to.</p>
<p>According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was brought to earth from heaven by Shiva, to save the world from drought. It is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.</p>
<p><strong>Shiva has four hands</strong>, which either carry some symbolic object or depict a hand pose called <strong><em>mudra</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2085" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=528%2C621&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="528" height="621" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=871%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 871w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?resize=768%2C903&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/202-Shiva-Hands.jpg?w=921&amp;ssl=1 921w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upper right hand</strong> holds a drum, called <strong><em>Damaru</em></strong><u>,</u>which continues beating over time. Like a ticking clock, it symbolizes the primordial sound of regular and many creations and annihilations.</li>
<li>The <strong>lower right-hand</strong> palm is raised, known as <strong><em>abhaya </em></strong>mudra, signifying fearlessness towards evil. The same hand has a cobra wrapped around the wrist, designating fear, danger, and turmoil. Yet, the lord is unperturbed.</li>
<li>The <strong>upper left-hand</strong> holds <strong>agni</strong> (fire), an important element for the act of creation as well as destruction.</li>
<li>Crossing his chest, the <strong>lower left-hand</strong> hides the heart of the Shiva. It is known as <strong><em>tirodhaana</em></strong>, meaning concealment. The same hand points to the left foot.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shiva possesses three eyes</strong>. Inclusive of the third eye on the forehead, is an inner eye that opens a vast pool of inherent knowledge and wisdom. Adorned with accessories like a bracelet and necklace, the loincloth also blows with the vigorous movement of dance, touching the halo. Shiva stands one-footed on the dwarf demon names Apasmara Purusha, which exemplifies ignorance and illusion.</p>
<p>Most importantly, throughout all of this, Shiva continues to remain patient and peaceful, projecting the idea of control or <strong><em>sayyam</em></strong><em> </em>in the act. Hence, the sculpture is an eye opener in the chaotic world, where we tend to forget the higher purpose of life, while following a dogmatic routine.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this was Created</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> is a cult statue dedicated to Lord Shiva, a prominent Hindu god. One of the oldest religions of India, Hinduism had been a pivotal belief in addressing the meanings of icons used in art forms. The doctrine Shilpashastra is the most important in ancient Indian literature that compulsively dominates the form, style, and composition of early Indian sculpture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> condenses the ancient iconography of India, embodying the divine. It was created to anesthetize the laws of the universe into a narrative that can relate as well as connect to the common mass. It emulates the dancing form from the doctrine called Natyashastra, a book of theatre. Thus, it was a cult statue throughout the sub-religions of India.</p>
<p>The sculpture of Shiva was first made <strong>in a dancing pose</strong> for temples during the 5th and 6th century CE as relief sculptures. The free-standing sculpture began to be made in the 10th century and <strong>preferably in bronze</strong>.</p>
<p>Around the 11th century, Nataraja statues were carried in processional parades, comprising priests and devotees. As a concept of commemoration, the Natraja idols would be <strong>covered with red and green cloth, surrounded by candles and flowers</strong>. The presence of the god in the statue, or deifying the idol, comes into being when a devotee worships it with immense faith.</p>
<p>Indian art was based on the fundamental principles of art and aimed at evoking the inherent emotion <strong>(bhava)</strong> of the art piece into the audience called <strong>rasa</strong>. The experience of expected <strong>rasa</strong> in the viewers is the marker of the successful artwork. Hence, developing an enormous reverence to the holy process of annihilation, which will inevitably become the ground of creation, Natraja follows this indoctrinated philosophy of art sincerely.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p>Composed in a balanced format, this bronze sculpture is from the Chola dynasty of the 10th century. The Chola artist employed the <strong>lost wax process</strong> or Cire perdue technique of casting. Hence<strong><em>, Natraja</em></strong> is also created with the same process. The cire perdue entails a long process of forming a wax model to prepare a core around it and pouring the molten metal either to produce a hollow or a solid cast.</p>
<p>During the Chola period, bronze casting was in vogue, which is proved by a range of artifacts of a variety of Indian gods available in diverse collections. Significantly, these sculptures project stone temple carvings&#8217; style along with the iconographical features, which purports a commendable merger of technique and aesthetics. With the instruction from Shilpashastra, the <em>talman </em>or the proportion for the divine figures was preordained. The doctrine also commands how limbs should be styled, underlining Hindu ideology.</p>

<h5><strong>Patron</strong></h5>
<p>The Chola dynasty served as a patron to <strong><em>Natraja</em></strong> or <strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance</em></strong>. Proliferating in trade and development, the Chola regions observed notable advancement in bronze casting. Moreover, the expanse of the empire extended until Sri Lanka in the south and other southeast Asian countries. Hence, they had enormous access to vast copper reserves, which multiplied the production of bronze sculptures.</p>

<p><strong>Angkor Wat, in Siem Reap, Cambodia</strong> is the largest religious monument in the world. It was <strong>built for the patron King Suryavarman</strong> II (1113–1145/50 C.E.) and dedicated to the Hindu god <strong>Vishnu</strong>, one of the three principal gods in the Hindu pantheon, along with <strong>Shiva and Brahma</strong>. Vishnu is known as the protector.</p>
<p>It is believed that <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> was also to house the king after death and used as a mausoleum.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> comes from the Khmer language, the official language of Cambodia. It means City Temple.</p>
<p><strong>Siem Reap</strong> was once the capital of the Khmer empire, then known as Angkor. From the 800s to the 1300s it was a prosperous hydraulic facility that collected monsoon waters from the rainy season, in huge basins. This elevated flooding, and protected plantations during drought.</p>
<p><strong>Merchants and traders of gold and spices brought Hinduism and later Buddhism</strong>. Business opportunities caused people to stay in the region</p>
<p>Since Angkor itself was the technical source of the life-giving agricultural water controlled by the king, it was regarded by the Khmer with religious reverence. Its temples and palaces were an expression of that and at the same time an essential part of its supernatural mechanism.</p>
<p>Royal intercession by numerous ceremonies, some of which re-enacted the primal marriage of Hindu divinity and native earth spirit on the pattern of ancient folk cult, ensured the continuing gift of the waters of heaven.</p>
<p>The king, an earthly image of his god, was the intermediary who ensured that his kingdom would continue to receive divine benevolence in the form of water in controlled quantities.</p>
<p>Courtiers played roles both religious and administrative for the king, who believed that after his death he would be united with his patron deity. Dedicatory statues were often set up in his chief temple to commemorate his divinization.</p>
<p>The Khmer kings were tied to the city, even as they changed religions. The city was transformed using both Hindi and Mahayana Buddhist architecture and artistic style layers beneath the surface of the temple.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>A large moat and a high wall surround Angkor Wat on all sides, which are longer than one kilometer.</p>
<p>Inside the temple develops on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new enclosure, formed of galleries, pierced with monumental porches on all four sides and provided with corner towers</li>
<li>a <strong>second floor</strong> repeating the same arrangement</li>
<li>a <strong>central tower</strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries staggered and interconnected by cruciform galleries</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>temple mountain</strong> was a Southeast Asian invention in architecture. It represented a union between the gods and the reigning king. The capital, a square measuring 4 kilometers on each side was lined with a double rise of land. Here two axial avenues crossed ending in a natural hill in the center.</p>
<p>The five stone towers symbolized the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru, the mythical home of Hindu and Buddhist gods. It was also considered an <strong>axis-mundi</strong> or a world axis that connects heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In his city, the king could intercede and re-enact the marriage of the Hindu divinity and the earth spirit to ensure the continuing gift of waters from the heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The temples continued to multiple, with each sovereign trying to outdo the next.  The small temple of <strong>Banteay Srei</strong>, built in 967, is located 20 kilometers north-east of Angkor. It is surrounded by a low-rise enclosure that is pierced by entrance pavilions and bordered by a moat. With three towers consisting of pink sandstone, this is the first temple to use relief sculptures to illustrate Indian legends. This is a prelude to classical Khumer style. Note the reliefs of <strong>devatas </strong>(gods of Hindu epics such as Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and the <strong>tympanums</strong> depicting Hindu myths, such as the rain of Indra.</p>
<h5><strong>Rich in Decoration </strong></h5>
<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> over a thousand dancing <strong>apsaras </strong>(female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) unfold on the walls of the different courts and on the pilasters. Dressed in a bell skirt from which are two large pieces of cloth at the waist, they are lavishly adorned with bracelets, armbands, necklaces and earrings, and extravagant hairstyles.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Bas-Relief Sculptures</strong></h5>
<p>The greatest achievement of the <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> sculptors has been reached in the tens of meters long bas-reliefs of the galleries of the second such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk</em></strong> or <strong><em>Heavens and Hells</em></strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>The Myth </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Churning of the Milk</em></strong> is a Hindu myth about the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil, as well as light and darkness. Due to this struggle twelve precious things are lost in the ocean.</p>
<p>The god Vishnu thought to use the holy mountain Mt. Mandara as a churning stick, surrounded by the serpent king (naga). This was tugged between the demons and the gods. They pulled with all their might! The churning stick stirred the waters of the milky sea for 1000 years&#8212; before recovering the <strong>amrita</strong>, the elixir of eternal life. The foam from the churning produces apsaras<em>,</em> who appear on both sides of Vishnu. Once the elixir was released, the supreme god of the Vedes, Indra descended to catch it and to save the world from the demons.</p>
<h5><strong>The Rise of Jayavarman VII</strong></h5>
<figure id="attachment_2061" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2061" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2061" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199.-D.jpg?resize=650%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="650" height="436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199.-D.jpg?w=352&amp;ssl=1 352w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199.-D.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2061" class="wp-caption-text">Jayavarman VII as Buddha<br />© HansStieglitz@t-online.de</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the death of Suryavarman II, the Champa (the people of nowadays Vietnam) occupied the Khmer kingdom for four years (1145 to 1149).</p>
<p>Jayavarman VII achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>liberated his country and restored order.</li>
<li>conquered Champa (Vietnam), Laos, Thailand and Burma achieving the maximum extent of the Khmer kingdom</li>
<li>enthroned in 1181</li>
<li>reorganized the Khmer country</li>
<li>built a road network linking the provinces to the capital and lined them with lodgings for travelers</li>
<li>built hospitals</li>
<li>changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahāyāna).</li>
<li>raised temples dedicated to the worship of his parents</li>
<li>1186, that of Ta Prohm, in Angkor itself, dedicated to his mother deified under the aspect of a female counterpart bodhisattva.</li>
<li>1191, the temple of Preah Khan of Angkor, in memory of his father in the aspect of Bodhisattva &#8220;Lord of the World&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>A Work in Progress</strong></h5>
<p>Simultaneously, <strong>Jayavarman VII </strong>had to restore Angkor Thom the capital itself, destroyed and pillaged by the Chams. It used to be centered on the Baphuon, which was more than a hundred years old.  Jayavarman VII recentered it on a new temple-mountain, the Bayon and surrounded it by a moat and a high wall of stone. The new city, Angkor Thom, was &#8211; like the previous ones &#8211; enclosed in a vast quadrilateral, each side of which was oriented in relation to a cardinal point. Four triumphal ways (north-south and east-west) cut it into quarters.</p>
<p>The Buddhist cosmology inspired the symbolism and dispositions of the great foundations (Angkor Thom, Preah Khan, etc.). The architecture (plans and elevations of the temples, construction processes) and sculpture (iconography, aesthetics, adjustments) of the style of the center of its new capital, Bàyon break with four centuries of stylistic evolution and mark its end.</p>
<h5><strong>The Plan</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2088" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199-Plan.png?resize=727%2C524&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="727" height="524" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199-Plan.png?w=727&amp;ssl=1 727w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/199-Plan.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Construction was not random. By combining Brahmanic notions and Buddhist ideas the architectural purpose was the glorification of the king, his deification, and his identification with the empire. Jayavarman VII, converted to Buddhism, found satisfactory solutions present the capital as the center of the world of the gods, where the king lived as equal of the gods and the protector of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>moats were oceans that encircled the world, enclosing the mountain ranges that border it</li>
<li>doors, surmounted by towers adorned with the deified face repeated four times, facing each cardinal point</li>
<li>gave access to roads lined on both sides of a hundred and eight giants of stone holding a colossal naga</li>
<li>theme of churning of the ocean, myth of creation, and that of the rainbow unites heaven and earth.</li>
<li>In the center, the Bayon, symbolic temple-mountain with a circular interior and radiant reminiscent of the Buddhist stupas, provided 50 faces, with the &#8220;smile of Angkor&#8221;, which one finds the echo in the countless statuary of this time.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Angkor Wat as a Mandala</strong></h5>
<p>A <strong>mandala </strong>or circle in Sanskirt, is a spiritual geometric configuration of temples in Buddhism. This allows for harmony with the universe by aligning with the planets, sunrise, and sunset. <strong>Angkor’s</strong> central axis through the temple’s main tower, aligns with the morning sun of the Spring Equinox.</p>
<h5><strong>Destruction, Change and Abandonment</strong></h5>
<p>In 1234, Jayavaram VIII, who succeeded two Buddhist Kings, destroyed Angkor and all effigies of Buddha. He was an iconoclast operating at a very large scale. In total tens of thousands of Buddha images were defaced.</p>
<p>At the end of the 13th century, the definitive adoption of Theravāda Buddhism led to a radical change in architectural traditions and ended all major construction programs. Advocating a simpler way of life, the Theravada Buddhism made <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> the Buddhist center of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Around 1431 a new Thai attack destroyed the hydraulic system on which the economy of the kingdom was based. Shortly after, the royal court abandoned <strong>Angkor.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Angkor Wat</strong> and<strong> Petra’s</strong> stories are linked to their intricate water management systems consisting of canals and artificial water basins. Their engineering feats not only provided their inhabitants with a <strong>constant water source</strong> but tied their destiny to the <strong>ancient world trade routes</strong>.</p>
<p>In both cities, the merchants-navigators and caravans of the vast-reaching trading routes brought along their ideas. Think Hinduism and later Buddhism. They also brought traditions like Hellenistic architecture and the Greco-Roman model of interconnected public spaces.  This <strong>transformed the local cultures</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Angkor Thom</strong>, capital of the Ancient Cambodian Khmer Empire was an important center along the <strong>gold and spices</strong> trade networks of East and Southeast Asia. <strong>Petra</strong> the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom controlled the <strong>Incense Routes</strong> providing Arabian <strong>myrrh, frankincense and perfume</strong> to the Mediterranean cities and Dead Sea <strong>bitum</strong> for the ships.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Petra (400 BCE-100CE)</strong> and <strong>Angkor Thom</strong> urbanism ideas could not be more different.</p>
<p>The advent <strong>Angkor Wat </strong>(800-1400 CE) was announced by the Khmer royal tradition of building temple-mountains to their ancestors. The <strong>temple mountain</strong> was a Southeast Asian architectural invention to illustrate the union between the gods and the reigning king.</p>
<p>The Khmer capital was a gigantic square symbolizing the whole universe. Two axial avenues crossed it, ending in a natural hill at the center.  In the beginning of the 12th century, King Suryavarman II (1113-1145/50 C.E.) built the temple of <strong>Angkor Wat</strong>. He became the first king of the Angkor dynasty.</p>
<p>The original name of the temple was lost. Angkor Wat means <strong>City Temple</strong>. The temple was dedicated to <strong>Vishnu</strong>, the Protector, one of the three main Hindu gods, Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma.  The galleries of its three ascending levels and the moat <strong>symbolized the oceans that surround Mt. Meru</strong>, the home of Hindu gods. The last level is a <strong>central tower</strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries arranged in staggered rows symbolizing the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru itself.</p>
<p><strong>Angkor’s</strong> central axis given by temple&#8217;s main tower also aligns to the morning sun of the Spring Equinox. This <strong>axis-mundi</strong> is a <strong>cosmic axis connecting heaven and earth</strong>.</p>
<p>The effort demanded by the construction of <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> weakened the kingdom. It was briefly occupied by the Champa people of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Jayavarman VII liberated his country and changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahayana). The Buddhist cosmology inspired new constructions such as Preah Khan and Bayon.</p>
<p><strong>Angkor Wat</strong> survived as its plan allowed for its re-interpretation as a <strong>mandala </strong>or circle in Sanskrit. This is <strong>a spiritual geometric configuration</strong> that teaches believers the <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong> and the organization of the universe.  Its architects used the Hindu architecture for a Buddhist temple by replacing the typical Buddhist stupa, with the Mt. Meru. The believers circumambulated in the galleries around the staggered Mt. Meru. Raising level by level the believers understood the concept of eternal rebirth samsara and of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the architecture of <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> remained accompanied by a mostly Hindu bas-relief decoration including over a thousand dancing apsaras (female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) the allegories of Hindu deliverance from demons such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk</em></strong> in which the Devas (gods) fight the asura (demons) to reclaim order and power.</p>
<p><strong>Petra’s</strong> urbanism is far away from any geometrical planning. Dictated by the natural fragmented rocky environment of its surrounding sandstone cliffs, it did not allow the development of the traditional Greco-Roman grid patterns and resulted in a low-density urban network. In the early 1st century, during the reign of King Aretas IV, <strong>Petra’s </strong>cosmopolitan population peaked at almost 25,000 people and the heart of the city of <strong>Petra</strong> covered the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-369" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?resize=658%2C495&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="658" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?w=408&amp;ssl=1 408w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The city borrowed the <strong>Greco-Roman concept of public space</strong> with a monumental Roman-style theater carved directly into the sandstone bedrock, the two levels administrative/religious center of the “Great Temple”, and a colonnade street with portico. Its main axis followed the topography of Wadi Musa spring torrent.</p>
<p>After Trajan’s victory in 106 CE, the Roman conquerors built a colonnaded street on <strong>Petra</strong><strong>’s</strong> main axis connecting all its key centers.  A Roman triple-arched gate marked the access to <strong>Petra</strong><strong>’s</strong> old sacred quarter featuring Qasr el Bin, an ashlar-masonry square shrine and the colonnaded Winged Lions Temple. Both temples were dedicated to Nabatean Arabian idols.</p>
<p>Like <strong>Angkor Wat,</strong> in <strong>Petra</strong> the civil Hellenistic tradition was used for a different religious purpose. The Eastern cult of the dead created the unique rock-cut mausoleums of <strong>Petra</strong>. The result was so atypical that for a long time <strong>Petra</strong> was refused the status of a proper city and it was simply considered a necropolis.</p>
<p>The mausoleums line is at the entrance to the valley and crowns the cliffs surrounding the valley. The monumental Al-Khazneh, <strong>The Treasury</strong>— with its broken pediment and deeply carved tholos topped by a stone urn, Corinthian columns and reliefs of winged Victories, bare breasted Amazons and Castor and Polux— illustrates <strong>a flamboyant Alexandrian Hellenistic style</strong>. It draws a stark contrast with the <strong>Street of Facades</strong> and its smaller Eastern aniconic mausoleums with flat Mesopotamian roofs.</p>
<p>A row of rock-cut monumental columned tombs, <strong>The Royal tombs</strong> crowns the heights of the city itself. Their facades carved in the <strong>sandstone</strong> exhibit <strong>syncretic architectural elements</strong>: multi-storied Mesopotamian facades, Egyptian monumentality and Hellenistic colonnades and pediments. The <strong>Palace Tomb</strong> is the largest, the <strong>Corinthian Tomb</strong> has floral decorative elements, and the <strong>Silk Tomb</strong> has a wavy moiré rock façade.</p>
<p>Other monuments carved into the towering cliffs, such as <strong>Ad-Deir</strong>, or the Monastery were initially considered tombs. Ad-Deir Hellenistic architecture elements strikingly resembles ones of the Al-Khazneh, <strong>The Treasury</strong> showing the continuous experimentation of <strong>Petra’s </strong>architects with different cultural elements.  However, its austere decorations featuring circle-patterns is a legacy of the Nabataean non-figurative artistic tradition. <strong>Crosses etched onto the walls</strong> show that the Byzantines re-used it later as a church.</p>
<p>At <strong>Petra</strong> the recycling of monuments and integration of new ideas in the Nabatean did not stop with Nabataean Ptolemaic and Roman rulers. In the Byzantine period, mausoleums were converted into churches, and the spolia of damaging earthquakes served to construct new Christian Byzantine monuments.</p>
<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat</strong> and <strong>Petra </strong>art waned when their multicultural societies were threatened by the raise of religious intolerance.  The religious sites of Angkor Thom and Petra faced a methodical Hindu and respectively Muslim iconoclasm. This destroyed in <strong>Angkor</strong> all the effigies of the Buddha and in <strong>Petra</strong> all the human and animal faces.</p>

<h5><strong>Buddhism and Monasteries</strong></h5>
<p><strong>What is a Monastery?</strong></p>
<p>A monastery is a community for men, as monks, or woman as nuns. The word monk is from the Greek word <strong>monos</strong> which means to be alone.  Here, they form a new society for themselves, which is devoted to religious practices, including prayer and rituals.</p>
<p>Before monasteries were built both Buddhist and Christian monks had to rely solely on the kindness of others. The wandered the country, without a place to call home, practicing self-denial, in pursuit of religious goals. People gave them not only food, but shelter in bad weather.</p>
<p><strong>The Function</strong></p>
<p>Once monasteries were built, monks had  a community to live in with like minded others.</p>
<p>In Buddhism and Christianity monks or nuns pray on behalf of the people and the monastery is the spiritual focus of the town.</p>
<p>In Christianity, the monks pray for the salvation of the souls of the living.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics of Buddhism</strong></p>
<p>It is different in Buddhism because there is no concept of a soul.  There is instead a cycle of rebirth called <strong>samsara</strong>. This is thought to be a repetitive state. But, when someone finally reaches <strong>moksha</strong>, this is when release from samsara occurs. This ends attachment to both the material world and the ego. In this state nirvana or liberation is reached. This is the final state in which there is <strong>oneness with everything</strong>.</p>
<p>The prayers and meditations are thought to help the community, as the common person would not possess the proper skills. Although they could turn to the monastery for instruction as well.  The people of the community can improve their <strong>karma</strong>, by giving donations of food and other useful items to the monastery.</p>
<p><strong>Dharma</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong>, also known as <strong>Dharma</strong> or the law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life is suffering (suffering = rebirth) </strong></li>
<li><strong>The cause of suffering is desire. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The cause of desire must be overcome.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When desire is overcome, there is no more suffering (suffering = rebirth)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is understood that moksha is extremely difficult to achieve. Buddha’s teachings focus on Enlightenment to assist.</p>
<p><strong>The Middle Way</strong>:  Following the middle path between extreme asceticism and extreme indulgence</p>
<p>Buddha taught the <strong>Noble Eightfold Path </strong>involving ethical conduct<strong> (<em>sila</em>), </strong>concentration<strong> (<em>samadhi</em>), </strong>and wisdom<strong> (<em>prajna</em>).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Right view</strong>: understanding where one is heading before beginning <strong>(wisdom)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right intention: </strong>committing to following the path <strong>(wisdom)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right speech</strong>: what is said to not harm others <strong>(ethical conduct)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right action</strong>: what is done to not harm others <strong>(ethical conduct)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right</strong> <strong>livelihood</strong>: daily living that does not cause harm to others <strong>(ethical conduct)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right effort</strong>: focusing energy to the task at hand <strong>(concentration)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right mindfulness</strong>: awareness of not harming oneself or others <strong>(concentration)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Right concentration: </strong>a dedication to practice such as meditation <strong>(concentration)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Types of Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>To the first of his followers, and the tradition associated with <strong>Theravada Buddhism</strong> and figures like the great Emperor Ashoka, the Buddha was a man, not a God. He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the Mahayana School, Buddha was a savior and often a god—a god concerned with man’s sorrows above all else. The <strong>Mahayana form of Buddhism</strong> is in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrayana </strong>is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, with many rituals which define it as different. It is practiced mostly in Tibet, Mongolia and in parts of China.</p>
<p><strong>Similarities:</strong> Buddha was the founder, and they all follow the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Differences:</strong> attainment of Nirvana. Only monks can obtain Nirvana in Theravada, as is traditional Buddhism. In the Mahayana form of Buddhism followers believe that everyone can.</p>
<h5><strong>Hinduism vs. Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Buddhism arose from Hinduism. Both believe in reincarnation, karma, and working toward a good life to ultimately achieve enlightenment.</p>
<p>Hinduism has a caste system, while Buddhism does not. It does not have the rituals, priest or gods and goddesses that the Hindus do.</p>
<h5><strong>An Inspiration for Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Three types of architecture were inspired by Buddhist communal and monastic spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stupa</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vihara</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chaitya</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>stupa</strong> came first. It is considered a sepulchral monument or a place for burial or receptacle for relics. Typical items would include objects or items the person wore. After monasteries started to be built, these items were removed from the <strong>stupa</strong> and they were left to simply become symbols of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The original <strong>stupa</strong> was important. It was built by the first Buddhist ruler of India, named Ashoka.</p>
<p>Between 120 BCE and 200 C.E. over 1000 <b><i>viharas</i></b> (a monastery with residence hall for the monks), and <strong>chaityas</strong> (a stupa monument hall), were established along ancient and prosperous trade routes. The monasteries required large living areas.</p>
<h5><strong>Ashoka: the first King to embrace Buddhism</strong></h5>
<p>Sites special to King Ashoka (304–232 B.C.E.), the first king (of northern India) to embrace Buddhism, were also integral to the building of monasteries.</p>
<p>The complex at Sanchi, where the original Great Stupa (Mahastupa) of Sanchi was created as a reliquary for the Buddha’s ashes after his death, became the largest of many stupas that were created later when a monastery was built at the site.</p>
<p>Ashoka added one of his famous pillars at this location—pillars that not only proclaimed his acceptance of Buddhism, but also served as instructional objects on Buddhist ideology.</p>

<h5><strong>Buddhist Monasteries in India</strong></h5>
<p>In India, by the 1st century, many monasteries were founded as learning centers on sites already associated with Buddha and Buddhism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lumbini</strong> where the Buddha was born,</li>
<li><strong>Bodh Gaya</strong> where he achieved enlightenment and the knowledge of the dharma (the Four Noble Truths),</li>
<li><strong>Sarnath</strong> (Deer Park) where he preached his first sermon sharing the <em>dharma</em></li>
<li>Kushingara where he died.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Buddhist Cave Temples</strong></h5>
<p>Located in hilly, isolated regions, Buddhist cave temples were used for monks practicing their religion. In India where Buddhism was founded, there are more than 1300 of these cave temples. These were mainly built between the second century BC and the seventh century AD.</p>
<p>Each cave has a specific architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaitya</strong> (worship hall)</li>
<li><strong>Vihara</strong> (monastery)</li>
<li>Decorative with sculptures and murals pertaining to Buddhist religion</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>chaitya</strong> has a church-like structure. It has a long hall, with a horseshoe sounded hall at the end. Here there are mound shrines or <strong>stupas. </strong>These are enshrined for worship.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2094" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chatiya.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="449" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Chaitya</em> at Karle near Lonavala, Maharashtra, first century B.C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The <em>stupa</em> is at the end of the nave (the main central aisle) On either side of the columns are side aisles to help people walk through the space—around to the stupa, and back out.</p>
<p>This is <strong>similar to the architecture of Early Christianity</strong> where the side aisles at the Early Christian Church in Rome, Santa Sabina, which help the flow of people who come to worship at the altar at the end of the nave).</p>
<p>Monks lived in <strong>vihara</strong> caves. The architecture of these spaces is rectangular with a flat roof. There is a long hall in the center with sleeping quarters and mortuary temples along the sides. The name <strong>vihara </strong>translates into a secluded place to walk, in reference to a dwelling with an open courtyard.</p>
<h5><strong>Rock Cut Caves</strong></h5>
<p>The rock-cut caves were established in the 3rd century B.C.E. in the western Deccan Plateau, the southern portion of India.</p>
<p>The earliest rock-cut caves include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bhaja Caves</li>
<li>Karle Caves</li>
<li>Ajanta Caves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Profitable relationship existed between the monks and wealthy traders. The Bhaja caves were located on a major trade route from the Arabian Sea eastward toward the Deccan region linking north and south India. Merchants, wealthy from the trade between the Roman Empire and southeast Asia, often sponsored architectural additions including pillars, arches, reliefs and façades to the caves. Buddhist monks, serving as missionaries, often accompanied traders throughout India, up into Nepal and Tibet, spreading the dharma as they travelled.</p>
<p>During <strong>Hinayana (lesser vehicle)</strong> the memory of historical Buddha and his teachings were recent, so there were no images of Buddha. Eventually, the rock-cut monasteries became quite complex. They consisted of several stories with inner courtyards and veranda.</p>
<p>In the later Mahayana (greater vehicle) phase, there was a need for physical reminders of the Buddha and his teachings. Images of the Buddha drawn from the jataka stories—the life stories of the Buddha—, or of the Buddha performing his Enlightenment and his first sermon (when he shared the Four Noble Truths with the laity) proliferated in both paintings and reliefs. A stupa was still placed in the central hall, but now an image of the Buddha was carved into it, underscoring that Buddha is the stupa.</p>
<h5><strong>Early Caves in Northern India: Bhaja, Ajanta</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2096" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?resize=650%2C488&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>At <strong>Bhaja</strong> there are no representations of the Buddha other than the stupa since Bhaja was an active monastery during <strong>the earliest phase of Buddhism</strong>, <em>Hinayana</em> (lesser vehicle), when no images of the Buddha were created. In <em>Hinayana</em>, the memory of the historical Buddha and his teachings were still a very real part of the practice. The Buddha himself did not encourage worship of him (something images would encourage), but desired that the practitioner focus on the <em>dharma</em> (the law, the Four Noble Truths).</p>
<p>The main <em>chaitya</em> hall (which contained a memorial stupa, empty of relics) at Bhaja contains a solid stone stupa in the nave flanked by two side aisles. It is the earliest example of this type of rock-cut cave and closely resembles the wooden structures that preceded it. The columns slope inwards, which would have been necessary in the early wooden structures in the north of India to support the outward thrust from the top of the vault. In similar stone caves, sometimes the columns are placed in stone pots, which mimic the stone pots the wooden columns were positioned in, to thwart termites. This is an example of a practical architectural practice being adopted as the standard.</p>
<p>At <strong>Ajanta</strong>, the earliest phase of construction also belongs to the Hinayana (lesser vehicle) phase of Buddhism (in which no human image of the Buddha was created). The caves are very similar to those at Bhaja. During the second phase of construction, Buddhism was in the <strong>Mahayana</strong> (greater vehicle) phase and <strong>images of the Buddha</strong>, predominantly drawn from the jataka stories—the life stories of the Buddha—were painted throughout.</p>
<p>In Mahayana, which was more distant in time from the life of the Buddha, there was a need for physical reminders of the Buddha and his teachings. Thus images of the Buddha performing his Enlightenment and his first sermon (when he shared the Four Noble Truths with the laity) proliferated. The paintings at Ajanta provide some of the earliest and finest examples of Buddhist painting from the period. The images also provide documentation of contemporary events and social custom under Gupta reign (320-550 C.E.).</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Buddhism Iconisn-Aniconism</strong></h5>
<p>The “aniconic mode” of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism</strong> developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that <strong>never show the Buddha in human form</strong>. Instead, <strong>his presence was indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations</strong> as well as by his “non-image.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>Chinese aniconic phase</strong> refrained from any pictorial representation whatsoever and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy</strong>. The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.</p>
<h5><strong>The icon (corporeal body) of the Buddha in India and China: Gandhara style</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2097" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Icon.jpg?resize=802%2C613&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="802" height="613" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Icon.jpg?w=420&amp;ssl=1 420w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Icon.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After the 1st century C.E., <strong>with the development of Mahayana Buddhism</strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form. These new, iconic images of the Buddha were particularly popular in the region of <strong>Gandhara (in present-day Pakistan)</strong> and <strong>in Māthura, south of New Delhi.</strong> They were depictions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, i.e. bodhisattvas. Many of the concept’s characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism appear to have developed in Gandhara.</p>
<p>These anthropomorphic images usher in <strong>a new phase of Buddhist art</strong> in which artists convey meaning through the <strong>depiction of special bodily marks (lakshanas) and hand gestures (mudras) of the Buddha</strong>.</p>
<p>In this anthropomorphic image of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the artist depicts Prince Siddhartha seated on a throne, surrounded by the demon Mara and his army, who attempted—unsuccessfully—to thwart Prince Siddhartha’s attainment of enlightenment. At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth.</p>
<h5><strong>The Influence of Alexander the Great</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandhara</strong> is the ancient name of a region in <strong>northwest Pakistan</strong>. It is bounded on the west by the Hindu Kush Mountain range and to the north by the foothills of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>In 330 B.C., <strong>Alexander the Great conquered this region and familiarized its artists with the classical Greek sculpture</strong>. Starting about 50 B.C., Kushan era, the sea trade driven by monsoons increased. Thus, merchants from Rome and Middle East passed through Gandhara on their way to Central Asia and China. Gandharan control of the high mountain passes vital to this international commerce made the region wealthy. The resulting cosmopolitan elites became some of the most powerful Buddhist patrons in all South Asia.</p>
<h5><strong>Art of Gandhara</strong></h5>
<p>This art combines (syncretism) <strong>local characteristics</strong> with elements derived <strong>from both Indian and western (Greek, Roman) cultures.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Gandhara Buddha</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the body is hidden with<strong> heavy cloak echoing a Roman toga; </strong>its <strong>sharp folds</strong> echoing <strong>Greek Parthenon draping styles </strong>form concentric curves centered on the right shoulder.</li>
<li>the face is elongated, the chin is quite prominent, and the corners of the relatively thin mouth are slightly sunken.</li>
<li>the eyes are narrow under a heavy lid, gazing downward in compassion to the world</li>
<li>the <strong>wavy Greek-like hair </strong>is gathered into a topknot symbolic of wisdom</li>
<li>a lightly incised circle, called an <strong>urna</strong>, appears between the eyes.  The urna was an identifying mark of the Buddha’s divine status and ability to see beyond our realm.</li>
<li>Buddha has long earlobes that recall the heavy royal earrings he once wore</li>
<li>the second-century <strong>Bodhisattva Maitreya had a musculature markedly western/Greek</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha is shown in his human shape because of his last incarnation in the human world,  but particular bodily marks are witness to his transcendence of the human realm. <strong>After enlightenment, the historical prince Siddhartha Gautama acquired various marks (lakshana) that identify him as the Buddha.</strong></p>
<p>The importance of the bodily attributes for any Buddha image in India and China can hardly be overestimated. Descriptions of these are formalized in the Buddhist canon, specifying 32 primary and 80 secondary superhuman attributes.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the local lists are homogenous. The major bodily attributes of a Buddha are witness to his completion of awakening and are, therefore, the only adequate way to represent him in human form.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s body is dignified, well proportioned, and extremely tall, with its slender and long limbs.  The top hair bump, and the hair into tiny snail stylized curls. Another mark is the urna between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s earlobes are extended in reference to the heavy jewelry he wore previously as a prince. He wears a simple monk’s robe, in keeping with his spiritual purpose, and sits in a lotus position. His skin was said to be of a golden hue, emitting light from every single pore.</p>
<p>Fingers have all the same length, or special markings on the palms and on the soles of the feet. All parts of the Buddha’s body, even features that cannot be represented, like his voice, are determined by his being enlightened.</p>
<p>Often the face and the uncovered parts of the body were gilded, representing the light emitting from the Enlightened One’s body.</p>
<p>Other important attributes mentioned in the texts pertain to <strong>the meanings of his hands position, the <em>mudras,</em></strong> which evoke ideas during Buddhist meditation or rituals:</p>
<ul>
<li>right hand over right knee (calling Earth as a witness to Enlightenment)</li>
<li>right hand held up with palm out (symbolizing giving reassurance, “no fear”)</li>
<li>hands held at chest with fingers turning invisible wheel (setting in motion the “wheel of the doctrine”—that is, preaching)</li>
<li>hands placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched palms facing upwards (“meditation mudra”)</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>A Parallel with the Icon of Christ</strong></h5>
<p>A remarkable parallel can be drawn with the icon of Christ. The portrayal of his physical features follows the notion of a “delineation,” which places every human being into a coded system of features that establish a distinctive identity.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Patriarchs of the Byzantine stated that “The icon of a man is not inscribed according to nature, but according to position.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<p>In other words, there was no doubt about what the historical, incarnated Christ “looked like,” because there was only one way in which He could have manifested physically in the world. Thus “an icon has to be seen as a living eyewitness of actual events.” (Barber 2002).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Buddha Sculptures &#8211; Mathura style</strong></h5>
<p>The Mathurā school started in in the <strong>central northern India</strong> and it was contemporaneous with the NW school of Gandhara (1st century CE). During a period in which Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism flourished in India, Mathura was a sacred place for the followers of Jainism who sculpted their deities</p>
<p><strong>Mathura Buddhas</strong> are related to the earlier Indian yakṣa figures (male nature deity), a direct continuation of the old Indian art of Sanchi with few Gandharan elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>facial types are more Indian-like and have a round smiling face</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buddha iconography:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>full of energy with broad shoulders, swelling chest,</li>
<li>if standing the legs are firmly planted and spaced apart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mudras</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the left-hand palm facing down in “calling earth as witness” mudra</li>
<li>often the right hand forms a mudra of “fearlessness” representing protection, peace,</li>
</ul>
<p>benevolence and the dispelling of fear; the left arm akimbo or resting on the thigh</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Warmer climatic conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buddha’s torso is dressed in a transparent monk’s robe</li>
<li>a higher fluidity of the clothing</li>
<li>drapery is closely molding the body giving the illusion of nudity</li>
<li>the right shoulder bare</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>details tend to be less realistic, and more symbolic</li>

<p>The<strong> <em>Great Stupa at Sanchi</em> </strong>in<strong> Madhya Pradesh, India </strong>is a work of<strong> stone masonry </strong>with<strong> sandstone on the dome. </strong>The initial monastic center started with the original stupa (Stupa1) + monolithic pillar built by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (reigned circa 269-232 BC) in the 3rd century BC.</p>
<p><strong>Sanchi Stupa’s outstanding importance include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large hemispherical dome crowned with a triple stone umbrella (chattras-Buddha stays under a chakra as royalty does) surrounded by a square railing</li>
<li>Around the 1st century CE under the Shungas</li>
<li>The stupa was later enlarged and encased in stone</li>
<li>The four magnificently carved gateways called toranas were added at the cardinal points.</li>
<li>The square posts of the entrances support three curved architraves with scrolled ends completely covered with relief sculptures</li>
<li><strong>Depict Jatakas (stories of the Buddha&#8217;s earlier incarnations, Bodhisattavas), </strong></li>
<li><strong>Scenes from the life of the historical Buddha </strong></li>
<li><strong>Buddhist aniconic symbols. </strong></li>
<li>A stone-paved processional path at the ground level enclosed by a balustrade and accessed through the four gateways</li>
<li>A second higher terrace, also enclosed by a railing, is approached by a double staircase.</li>
<li>Represents the Buddha, the path to Enlightenment, a mountain, and the universe</li>
<li>Following the decline of Indian Buddhism, the site decayed; rediscovered in the 19th century</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Great Stupa at Sanchi</em></strong> acknowledges <strong>early fertility symbols</strong> associated with the vitality of the <strong>fruit-bearing tree.</strong> At each end of the ornate torahs (gates) three yakshi sculptures act as architectural brackets, supporting the sandstone beams that ran above their heads. The yakshi is the almost nude female figure clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with a leg along its trunk. They wear jewelry around their necks, waists, and ankles.</p>
<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa- Circumambulating path to Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/92.-Stupa-Plan.jpg?resize=722%2C1088&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="722" height="1088" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Circumambulating</strong> is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong> (also known as the dharma and the law). By turning around, they understand what means to be caught up in samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death. Escaping on the 2nd terrace allows them to understand the escape from the cycle, the <strong>Enlightenment.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stupa= a circle or wheel and the unmoving center symbolizes Enlightenment.</li>
<li>stupas are placed on a square base, and the four sides represent the four directions, north, south, east and west.</li>
<li>Each side often has a gate—torana— in the center, which allows the practitioner to enter</li>
<li>Each gate is a life event of the Buddha: East (Buddha’s birth), South (Enlightenment), West (First Sermon where he preached his teachings or dharma), and North (Nirvana).</li>
<li>The gates are turned at right angles to the axis mundi to indicate movement in the manner of the arms of a svastika, a directional symbol that, in Sanskrit, means “to be good”</li>
<li>They are guarded by guardians to remind the passage from mundane to sacred. They are either nude or dressed with a local dhoti</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sanchi Stupa Aniconic representations of Buddha</strong></h5>
<p>Sculptural friezes at important early Buddhist stupas like Sanchi depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, with the <strong>Buddha represented in aniconic form</strong>, using certain fixed symbols. On the Northern gate of “stupa one” in Sanchi the <strong>Buddha’s body is represented by the Body tree, a crowning lotus rosette </strong>on a column like structure, <strong>a stupa</strong>, the <strong>Buddha’s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).</strong></p>
<p>Each symbol <strong>represents a pivotal event in Buddha’s life:</strong> a lotus (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, a fig tree or throne representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, a wheel, a flaming column with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and a stupa (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.  In some cases, he is also represented by a pair of footprints.</p>
<h5><strong>Stupa -Jataki Monkey King story &#8211; Bodhisattva</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A depiction of the Mahakapi Jataka</strong> appears on the western gateway of the Great Stupa (Stupa 1) at Sanchi.  <strong>The first scene, depicted at the bottom, shows the arrival of the king of Benaras</strong>, mounted on a horse accompanied by soldiers. The king is shown with a parasol or chatra over his head, which signifies his royal status.</p>
<p>A feature that arouses curiosity is the portrayal of <strong>musicians who accompany the king</strong>—perhaps meant to accentuate the royal status of the king, suggesting that he travels with an entourage of attendants and musical accompaniment. <strong>To the right</strong> of the king an archer appears with bow and arrow aiming at the Bodhisattva <strong>(Great Monkey)</strong>.</p>
<p>The artist(s) of the Sanchi relief shows the Bodhisattva as the bridge by which monkeys escape the king’s arrows to join the rest of the troop in the forest. <strong>On the left side of the river</strong> (which in this relief is full of active fish and rhythmic waves of water), two men, presumably following the order of the king, appear holding a sheet below the Great Monkey as he falls.</p>
<p>The episodes depicted in the Sanchi panel <strong>give no indication of order</strong> through either time or cause and effect. Such is the complexity of this portrayal that even a viewer well-versed in this story must closely examine the panel to “read” it accurately. Apparently, the artist made this for an audience with previous knowledge of the Jataka stories. There is mention of Bodhisattva instructing the king in Buddhist law before dying from the sustained wounds.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Stupas predate Buddhism</strong>. Before Buddha, teachers and philosophers were buried in stupas (Hindu funerary monuments). The shape was supposed to represent a person seated in meditation.</p>
<p>In the 6th century BCE stupas built after Buddhism contained portions of the Buddha’s ashes (not known exactly when Buddha died for sure). There were 8 stupas originally because there were 8 kings who wanted to split the remains.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century BCE Great Stupa was one of the oldest and best-preserved stupas from Ashoka’s reign. Ashoka was the greatest Mauryan king in India and the first ruler to associate with Buddhism in India. He converted after killing 100,000 people. When he converted, he disinterred Buddha’s remains from the other stupas and distributed the remains to his new stupas.</p>
<p>Ashoka built many stupas across his empire so the faithful could always access them. Ashoka chose this site because it was raised on a hill</p>
<p>In the 2nd century BCE, the Sunga Dynasty in India enlarged this stupa and decorated it by adding the gates.</p>

<p><strong>Buddha </strong>in <strong>Bamiyan, Afghanistan</strong> was one of two <strong>rock cut</strong> Buddhas fashioned with <strong>plaster, polychrome, and paint.</strong>  The largest stood <strong>150 feet tall</strong>. They were destroyed in 2001.</p>
<p>The main bodies were hewn directly from the sandstone cliffs. The stone was <strong>in situ</strong> and <strong>living rock</strong>. The details were modeled in mud, mixed with straw, coated with stucco. <strong>Gold and fine jewels</strong> were added These were gifts and offerings from pilgrims.</p>
<p>The <strong>niches</strong> are shaped like mandorlas to emphasize the statues. This also acts as protection from the elements such as rain, wind, and sun.</p>
<p>The works were an <strong>appropriation of Greek and Asian artforms.</strong> The <strong>Asian influence</strong> could be seen in the body form, facial features, and size. The <strong>Greek influence</strong> was present in the drapery and folds.</p>
<p>There is no knowledge of patron, artist, or details of the commission.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>larger Buddha</strong> was painted with a red robe and depicted as <strong>Vairocana</strong> Buddha who embodies all wisdom. This type of Buddha must be depicted as grand in size as it is a very masculine form of Buddha.</p>
<p>The <strong>smaller Buddha</strong> was painted with a blue robe and known as a historical Buddha. It may represent female aspects and as such is smaller.</p>
<p>The <strong>cave galleries</strong> are painted with wall paintings and images of Buddha. Pilgrims can walk through these caves.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gandharan</strong> was a diverse culture that emerged in Afghanistan. It was influenced by Alexander the Great’s Greek empire, Buddhism from the Silk Roads, and Indian kingdoms.</p>
<p><strong>Bamiyan</strong> was a <strong>caravanserai</strong>, a “highway town” of sorts for travelers on the Silk Road that connected China to the Mediterranean. The area contained numerous Buddhist sanctuaries. By the 7<sup>th</sup> century, there were 5,000 plus monks and pilgrims in Bamiyan.</p>
<p><strong>Buddhism</strong> is not location-specific, focuses on an afterlife, and is not class-specific. it can be worshipped anywhere and spread easily among traders. Mahayana Buddhism spread due to Chinese expansion westward. It developed a concept of Buddha as an incarnation of wisdom and truth. This meant Buddha was literally larger than life. As such, monumental statuary of Buddha emerged.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Timeline</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong>1221 CE, </strong>Ghengis Khan conquered this region of Afghanistan killing everyone but left the sculptures</p>
<p>Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, who was Muslim, tried to destroy the statues in the <strong>17<sup>th</sup> century.</strong></p>
<p>In March <strong>2001</strong> the Taliban, who determined these works were idols, dynamited and destroyed them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jowo Rinpoche </em></strong>is made from <strong>gilt metals</strong> with <strong>semiprecious stones, pearls</strong>, and <strong>paint</strong> as well as <strong>items from various offerings</strong>. It is believed to have been brought to Tibet in 641 CE. Today, the <strong>5-foot-tall</strong> sculpture sits in the <strong>Jokhang Temple, Lhasa, Tibet</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally,  the sculpture was in the style of <strong>Nirmanakaya </strong>which was simple and unadorned. But it was transformed into a <strong>Sambhogakaya</strong> or adorned sculpture because of all the offerings made to it.</p>
<p>The temples’ interior is a dark labyrinth of chapels and hallways.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the <strong>holiest object in Tibet. </strong>Since it represents the Buddha, it is believed to be Buddha’s proxy. It is based on what Buddha looked like when he was 12 and it was made during his lifetime. As such, it is an important pilgrimage destination for Tibetan Buddhists. They must take a pilgrimage here if they are able and three major pilgrimage routes dead end here.</p>
<p>This object is said to bestow freedom from fear and suffering, can grant wishes and quickens the path to enlightenment.</p>
<h5><strong>The Process for Pilgrims </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Before entering, pilgrims circumambulate the temple to create good spiritual energy</li>
<li>Inside the temple, pilgrims make their way to the central shrine, often crawling on their hands or sliding on their bellies.</li>
<li>They hum prayers while bringing offerings.</li>
<li>When they reach <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong>, they pray in front of it and give offerings</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jowo</strong> means <strong>Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rinpoche</strong> means <strong>precious one</strong></p>
<p><strong>Khang</strong> means <strong>house </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Visuals</strong></h5>
<p>This is the sacred image of <strong>Buddha at age 12</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urna</strong>: spiral or circular red dot on the forehead of Buddhist images</li>
<li>Stretched earlobes (previously as a prince, Buddha wore huge earrings that stretched out his ears)</li>
<li>Believed to be based off Buddha himself</li>
<li>Face is of inner focus and patience.</li>
<li>The meditative pose in lotus position signifies enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The temple was founded in 647 CE by King Gampo, 1<sup>st</sup> ruler of unified Tibet who imposed Buddhism. The Queen was Queen Wencheng, daughter of the Tang Chinese emperor. She is credited with bringing Buddhism to Tibet when she married King Gampo in 641 CE. Part of her dowry was the <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong>.</p>
<p>On her way to Tibet from China, her wagon got stuck in the mud. This was interpreted as the Jowo Rinpoche wanting to stay on that spot, so construction began on a temple. Every day when workers returned to the site, the construction they had done the previous day had been undone. This continued for 6 years!</p>
<p>Finally, a divination revealed that an ancient demoness was sleeping in the earth under the exact spot where they were building the temple. Every night, she would push her arms and legs, while thrashing around, wrecking the construction on the temple. To stop this, <strong>the main</strong> <strong>Jokhang Temple</strong> was built on her heart to weigh her down and prove Buddhism’s supremacy, and <strong>ten smaller temples</strong> were built around Jokhang Temple to hold down her arms and legs.</p>
<h5><strong>Development of Vajrayana Buddhism (Tantric Buddhism)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A further evolution of Mahayana Buddhism</strong>, Vajrayana (Sanskrit: “Thunderbolt Vehicle” or “Diamond Vehicle”) form of Buddhism that was developed in India about 500–600 C.E. in India and neighbouring countries, especially Tibet. It was based on the traditions of late (600) Indian and Chinese Buddhism with a strong emphasis on monasticism.</p>
<p>Unique to Tibetan Buddhism is the institution of the tulku (incarnate lama): <strong>Tibetan Buddhists believe that compassionate teachers are reborn again and again, in each lifetime. </strong>Identified when they are children and invested with the office and prestige of their previous rebirths. Tibet has had many such lamas, <strong>the most famous of whom is the Dalai Lama</strong>.</p>

<p>The Fifth Dalai Lama became ruler of Tibet in 1642, and under his rule was built the great palace of the Potala in Lhasa, the country’s capital. Tibet was incorporated into China in 1951, and the present (Fourteenth) Dalai Lama went into exile in India in 1959, when the Tibetan diaspora began. Since that time, Tibetan Buddhism has become of increasing interest to people throughout the world.</p>
<p>Based on a sophisticated scholastic philosophy that can be traced to ancient Hindu and Vedic texts, the followers of Vajrayana Buddhism believe in <strong>a shortcut to enlightenment through psychological/physiological transformations</strong>. This involves elaborate forms of tantric practice believed to be handed out by Buddha to selected disciples to recapture his own enlightenment experience. It also includes borrowed exorcism practices from Bön (Tibet’s indigenous belief system).</p>
<p><strong>They practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>yoga techniques of meditation, mantra (sacred power words)</li>
<li>rituals using vajra (the weapon of the Indian Vedic rain and thunder-deity Indra) and ghanta (bell), sacred images (such as those in the museum collection), hand and body gestures (mudra) .</li>
</ul>
<p>Tibetan Buddhism eventually spread into Mongolia and Nepal, as well as into China, where it received imperial patronage especially during the Yuan (1260–1368) and Qing (1368–1644) dynasties. It also influenced parts of Southeast Asia and East Asia.</p>
<p>As an offshoot of Mahayana Buddhism, the Vajrayana pantheon is made up of a vast group of buddhas, bodhisattvas, dakinis (female buddhas), and fierce deities whose devotees venerate them as great protectors.</p>
<p>Vajrayana’s <strong>visual arts culminate in the mandalas</strong>, elaborate diagrams representing the universe and used as meditation aids. <strong>Temples and mandalas are sacred spaces</strong> that believers can inhabit through meditation and can help interacting with buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Vajrayana Buddhists engage in <strong>a variety of rituals and ceremonies, some of which are considered taboo by other Buddhism branches</strong>: (visual) meditation practices, ritual devotion to buddhas and bodhisattvas, pilgrimage, and mantra recitation.</p>

<p>Romanesque Europe. Stone. 1050-1130 CE. Conques, France. Romanesque.</p>
<p><strong>A relic is an object that is esteemed or venerated because of association with a sanctified historical person</strong>. Catholic churches have a long history of collecting and venerating relics. The more closely something was associated with Christ, the more spiritually valuable it was.</p>
<h5><strong>Who was Sainte-Foy?</strong></h5>
<p>Sainte Foy (English: Saint Faith) was born in the French/Roman 2<sup>nd</sup> century city of Agen. She became a martyr when she was killed by the Romans by refusing to worship pagan gods. She was only 12 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Her skull became the relic</strong> that pilgrims wanted to visit. It was believed that it cured blindness.</p>
<p>There are formal characteristics shared by both <strong><em>Jowo Rinpoche and</em> <em>Reliquary of Sainte Foy</em> </strong> that relate to their association with relics . Each is shaped as a human whose pose, expression, and embellishment, indicate the core beliefs associated with the relics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Figural sculptures</li>
<li>Static, rigid postures and bilateral symmetry</li>
<li>Expressionless faces</li>
<li>Reflective luster of the surfaces</li>
<li>Seated position</li>
</ul>
<p>The rigid, static pose of these figures and their bilateral symmetry reflect a separation from earthly concerns and suggest a spiritual transcendence. This is also communicated through their <strong>calm, expressionless faces</strong>. Likewise, the <strong>reflective luster of the surfaces evokes an association with the spiritual realm</strong>. Finally, the seated positions of the figures convey different ideas.</p>
<p>The enthroned Sainte-Foy reflects the heavenly majesty of a sainted Christian marty, while the Jowo Rinopoche lotus position and “calling the earth as witness” mudra reflect his enlightenment.</p>
<p>The materials/imagery used reinforce the reliquary Sainte-Foy’s association with relics.</p>
<h5><strong>Materials</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>gold and silver</strong> convey the heavenly rewards (of Christian martyrdom)</p>
<p>The Reliquary of Sainte-Foy is a female figure enthroned and richly embellished. The figure is <strong>sculpted in wood and plated in gold and silver gilt repoussé</strong>. Cabochon <strong>gems and enameling</strong> add to the lavish presentation.</p>
<p>Many of the gemstones encrusting the surface were donated by pilgrims as part of their veneration.</p>
<p>There are <strong>elements of ancient Roman art</strong>. The head of the saint is a reused ancient Roman sculpture and antique cameos are found on the exterior. This links the reliquary to the Christian persecution era, corresponding with the age of the relics contained inside. This use of spolia (repurposed art) makes the object even greater in value by associating it with the treasures of the Roman Empire and by linking the sculpture to the era in which Sainte-Foy was martyred.</p>
<h5><strong> Imagery</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The youthful appearance of the figure which recalls the story of the 12-year-old martyr who refused to renounce her Christian faith.</li>
<li>The blank stare of the figure reflects a spiritual transcendence from earthly life.</li>
<li>The jeweled crown or throne that evokes the heavenly majesty of a sainted Christian martyr.</li>
<li>The lamb imagery and crucifixion scene at the base of the throne parallels the martyr’s sacrifice with that of Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Their function is associated with movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>with a destination to which pilgrims travel</li>
<li>a relic/reliquary is a fixed object in a specific location: a pilgrimage on a known route.</li>
<li>Their function is religious and cannot be explained outside a Christian/Buddhist context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>reliquary of Sainte-Foy</strong> is synonymous with its Christian context. Its function cannot be seen, considered, or described without reference to the Church of Sainte-Foy. The object does have a more varied history. The saint’s remains were transferred from Agen to Conques in the 9th century, and the head of the statue is widely believed to be a repurposed imperial portrait from the later Roman Empire. Yet the fundamental religious function of the reliquary of Sainte-Foy has remained the same for centuries.</p>
<p>The <strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong> despite the historical evidence is <strong>seen as a relic of the historical Buddha</strong>, carved by a celestial architect to serve as Buddha’s proxy after he leaves Earth.</p>
<p>Both works function is to express the power of their relics. The access to them is institutional, held by a religious order and held on display to be viewed by the public.</p>
<p>Once a year, on the saint’s feast day, the reliquary is paraded in a glass case through the town of Conques so that it may be viewed and venerated by large crowds. The reliquary also protects the relics. The actual relics of Sainte-Foy are not seen. They are believed to be engaged through prayer and contemplation during the pilgrimage.</p>
<p><strong>Jowo Rinpoche</strong> was built to act as a proxy of Buddha after he left Earth.</p>
<h5><strong>Difference in function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The relics of Sainte-Foy are never seen</li>
<li>Buddha relic, Jowo Rinpoche is permanently on display</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>(3)<em> 95. The Virgin of Guadalupe</em></strong></h5>
<p>Miguel González. New Spain. 1698 CE.  Based on original Virgin of Guadalupe, Basilica of Guadalupe, Mexico City.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-553" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/95-Virgin-of-Guadalupe.jpg?resize=369%2C489&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="369" height="489" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this work of oil on canvas, on wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl the standing Virgin hovers above an eagle on <strong>a cactus (Mexico’s city symbol),</strong> a winged cherub, and a crescent moon . Mary&#8217;s face has an ashen tone.</p>
<p>Gonzalez’s depiction of the Virgin Mary is tied to European traditions.  Her entire body is surrounded by a glowing aureole of light augmented with golden rays, her feet rest on a crescent moon, and she wears a golden crown. All are references to the Woman of the Apocalypse, in the Book of Revelation.</p>
<p>The Virgin’s robes have been crafted from mother-of-pearl using a new, luxurious technique known as enconchado, inspired by imported Far East artworks. The reflective luster of the mother-of-pearl in the light emphasizes a divine status .</p>
<p>In Miguel González’s <strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe (Virgen de Guadalupe)</em></strong> the Virgin Mary is depicted in the form of the image said to have imprinted itself miraculously on the cloak of an indigenous man, Juan Diego, to whom she appeared in Mexico in the 16th century. The standing figure of the Virgin, her eyes downcast and hands clasped in prayer, hovers above an eagle, its wings spread wide, perched on a cactus, all supported by a winged cherub. Four roundels depict the manifestation of the Virgin in an indigenous form in the new world</p>
<h5><strong>Function as a Devotional Object</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>the local features of the icon were intended to make the figure of Mary more accessible</li>
<li>to assist the converted local population in their devotions towards the Virgin</li>
<li>to promote the conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity</li>
<li>as a large artwork permanently affixed to a wall, it required the pilgrimage of devotees</li>
<li>as a copy of the famed, miracle-working image it has been credited with sharing some of the power of the original image displayed in the Basilica of Guadeloupe in Mexico City, yet there is no recorded a manifestation of divine action.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong>, in <strong>Central Java, Indonesia</strong>, is made from <strong>volcanic-stone masonry</strong>. It is <strong>the largest Buddhist temple in the world</strong> and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is 300 years older than Angkor Wat and 400 years older than the European Cathedrals. The Indonesian temple was buried under volcanic ash and overgrown with vegetation until discovered by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Raffles in 1814. A team of Dutch archaeologists restored the site in 1907–11. A second restoration was completed by 1983.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2106" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198-Details.jpg?resize=787%2C519&#038;ssl=1" alt="Detail © Edifice/Corbis" width="787" height="519" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198-Details.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198-Details.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Visiting the temple requires circumambulating through the corridors. It is a ritual that helps Buddhist to understand the Buddha’s teachings, known as the Four Noble Truths (also known as the dharma and the law). This helps to understand samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>Climbing up successive terraces allows for understanding the transition from the lowest manifestations of reality, through a series of spiritual regions, toward the enlightenment at the summit which allows unrestricted views of the mountains, offering a liberating feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p>One <strong>enters on the east gate</strong>, and <strong>reads from left to right</strong>, moving in a <strong>clockwise direction</strong> around the monument. Almost 5 km of <strong>carved bas reliefs</strong> educate the illiterate according to Mahayana Buddhism texts. These texts deal with the self-discovery and education of the bodhisattva, conceived as being with compassionate, and fully devoted to the salvation of all creatures.</p>
<p>The stories from Buddha’s life, Jataka and Avadana illustrate lessons on morality, karma and merit that distinguished the enlightened creature.</p>
<p>Buddhist religion, philosophy and cosmology is woven into the architecture of the Borobudur. The temple is the symbol of Mount Meru, which is considered the center of the universe in Indian cosmology.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the teachings of Buddha the temple represents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the Four Noble Truths</li>
<li>the Noble Eightfold Path</li>
<li>the three realms of existence: Kāmadhātu, Rūpadhātu and Arūpadhātu</li>
</ul>
<p>These help to guide the visitors  to follow the spiritual teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Kāmadhātu</strong> <strong>(Desire Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>160 reliefs based on the text of Mahakarmavibhangga, which is about the law of cause and effect (karma).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rūpadhātu (Form Realm)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scenes depicting mankind’s consciousness about the meaning of life through reliefs on a four sides gallery, both inside and out.</li>
<li>To view in the correct order, one must walk around clockwise four times and observe both upper and lower reliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arūpadhātu (Formless Realm) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reliefs depicted at the top illustrating Enlightenment (Nirvāṇa) which requires an almost five kilometer walk clockwise, ten times, to view correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Other Forms of Decoration</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>birds</li>
<li>flowers</li>
<li>mythical beings like Kāla above the temple entrance</li>
<li>Makara mythical being with an elephant trunk and an open mouth from which the head of a lion emerges are at the base of the gate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Borobudur Temple</strong> is shaped as a stepped grey andesite pyramid with 3 levels—a square base, a middle level of five square terraces, and an upper level of three circular terraces—totaling 9 lesser sections. The number 9 which represents the end of a cycle in the decimal system, which originated from the Indian subcontinent as early as 3000 BC is mystic in Buddhism and Hinduism. Important Buddhist rituals usually involve 9 monks.</p>
<p><strong>The historical Buddha had 9 virtues</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accomplished</li>
<li>Perfectly Enlightened</li>
<li>Endowed with knowledge and Conduct</li>
<li>Well-spoken</li>
<li>the Knower of worlds</li>
<li>the Guide Unsurpassed of men to be tamed</li>
<li>the Teacher of gods and men</li>
<li>Enlightened</li>
<li>Blessed</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>3 circular terraces carry small stupas</strong>, crowned at the centre of the summit by a large, circular, bell-shaped stupa, 115 feet (35 metres) above the base. The bottom plinth encasement that obscures an entire series of reliefs consists of a massive heap of stone pressed up against the original structure. It was probably added to hold together the bottom story, which began to spread under the pressure of the immense weight of earth and stone accumulated above.</p>
<p>The lowest level, which is partially hidden, contains reliefs of earthly desires, illustrating “the realm of feelings/desires”, <strong>the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe</strong>. It portrays the law of cause and effect. For example, if you like gossiping, you might be reborn with an ugly appearance.</p>
<p>The next level is a 13-foot-wide corridor open to the sky and adorned with bas-reliefs that depict “the realm of forms” through events in the life of the historical Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas. There are 2 registers: the balustrade depicting fables about altruism.</p>
<p>Opposite the balustrade is the main wall where the Jatakas stories are located.</p>
<p><strong>Lalitavistara</strong>, a set of 120 reliefs on the first platform, depict Prince Siddharta’s life from birth to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Queen Maya riding  in a horse carriage is retreating to Lumbini garden to give birth to Prince Siddhartha. In the nativity scene, Queen Maya&#8217;s depiction recalls the tree spirits or yakshinis. These spirits are are often shown as beautiful and voluptuous, with a flywhisk in right hand, fleshy cheeks, wide hips, narrow waists, broad shoulders, knotted hair and exaggerated, spherical breasts. According to legend, the infant stood and took seven steps. With each step, a lotus flower appeared, to prevent his tiny feet from touching the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Here is the Story</strong></p>
<p>“Prince Siddharta was born to King Sudhodana and Queen Maya of the Sakya clan who reigned in Kosala, India, around the fifth century BC. One day Queen Maya had a dream of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was interpreted by priests as a sign that the couple would bear a son, who would become either a world ruler or a Buddha. The king preferred him to be the world ruler, so he confined the prince in the palace and indulged him in sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>As fate had it, one day the prince went out of his palace and he saw a sick person, an old person, a corpse, and a monk. Siddharta realized that he, too, would become old, sick, and die. Later, he renounced his mundane life and embarked on his search for true happiness. After learning from several spiritual teachers, and practicing severe ascetism for six years, he finally meditated under a bodhi tree. Here he attained enlightenment. Because of his compassion for fellow humans, he revealed the path to achieve unconditional happiness.”</p></blockquote>
<h5>The Jataka Tales</h5>
<p>The <strong>Jataka tales</strong> are about the 500 Bodhisattvas, the alternating human and animal forms in which Buddha was reincarnated before he was born as Prince Siddhartha and attained enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>Animals perform self-sacrifices for other beings</strong>. “A sad monkey hugging a buffalo’s neck is the story of real friendship. One day a monkey had a problem. An ogre wanted to eat him. Devastated, the monkey told his buffalo friend about his fate. The buffalo comforted the monkey, saying that he would offer himself instead. What’s more, the buffalo’s body was bigger. The buffalo just asked themonkey to send his best wishes to his relatives. Then they both met the ogre. Touched by thekindness of the buffalo, the ogre dismissed his plan to eat either of them.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avadana (Noble Deeds)</strong> are similar to Jataka, but the main figures are legendary people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sudhana’s quest for enlightenment</strong></p>
<p>He was an Indian youth, maybe a merchant’s son seeking bodhi (enlightenment). He takes a pilgrimage on his quest for enlightenment and studies under 52 “teachers”: a doctor teaches him compassion for the ill, children playing teach him about simple happiness,…</p>
<p>The upper level illustrates “the realm of formlessness,” or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration, but lining the terraces are <strong>72 bell-shaped stupas, many containing a statue of the Buddha, partly visible through the lattice stonework</strong>. The <strong>504 Buddha statues are shaped to express 6 different mudras</strong> (hand positions).</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Buddha Hand Gestures and Significance</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>Right hand across right knee symbolizing the summons of the Earth Goddess.</li>
<li>Right hand open with the face of the hand facing upwards – a symbolic gesture of loving kindness by the act of giving.</li>
<li>Both hands folded on his lap symbolic for meditation.</li>
<li>Right hand raised upwards with the face of the hand facing the audience – a symbolic gesture of dispelling of fear.</li>
<li>Right hand slightly lifted upwards with the tips of his thumb and index finger touching each other – a symbolic gesture of preaching the Dharma.</li>
<li>Both hands raised in front of the center of the upper body, touching with his right ring finger his left index finger – by far the most important symbolic gesture, for it represents the turning of the wheel of the Dharma.</li>
</ol>
<p>The archways allow people to access the higher levels are decorated with pre-Buddhist elements,  such as the fearsome face and open mouth of Kala. This is a Hindu deity from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, In Javanese mythology, Batara. Kala is the god of destruction.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbolism of the Mandala</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2126" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=544%2C628&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="544" height="628" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=260%2C300&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 888w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?resize=768%2C885&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mandala-1.jpg?w=1041&amp;ssl=1 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The temple’s plan suggests a <strong>mandala</strong>, one of the richest visual objects in Buddhism. A mandala is a symbolic picture of the universe painted on a wall or scroll, or simply created with colored sands on a table. It represents an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation. Each object in the palace has significance, representing an aspect of wisdom or reminding the meditator of a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The <strong>mandala&#8217;s purpose is to help transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones</strong> and to <strong>assist with healing. </strong> The entire sacred manmade mountain of chiseled gray andesite is a giant stupa. On the topmost terrace, the main stupa contained an unfinished image of Buddha with the hands not fully carved that was hidden from the spectator’s view, symbolized the indefinable ultimate spiritual state.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques</strong></h5>
<p>Progressively the reliefs on the terraces become more static. The sensuous roundness of the forms of the figures is not abated but, in the design, great emphasis is laid upon horizontals and verticals and upon static, formal enclosures of repeated figures and gestures. At the summit all movement disappears.</p>
<p>The circular design enclosing the stupa, between the reliefs are decorative scroll panels, and a hundred monster-head waterspouts carrying off the tropical rainwater.</p>
<p>The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar.</p>
<h5><strong>The Javanese Variation</strong></h5>
<p>Although the origin of the temple is based on Indian mythology and Buddhist iconography, one can see the Javanese influence. The statues are less refined and have been recreated in the local perception of beauty. This is the way Buddhism was manifested in Java during the Sailendra dynasty.</p>
<p>Based on Indian influences and Mahāyāna Buddhism, arriving via China during Tang dynasty (618-906), this became the Buddhism of Java.</p>
<p>Sailendra dynasty shared their power with the Hindu dynasty Sanjaya. For example, the construction of the Kalasan temple – illustrates, that, apart from its religious function, the <strong>Borobudur</strong> also formed an important expression of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Tradition</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2107 " src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=717%2C473&#038;ssl=1" alt="Buddha © Dallas and John Heaton/Free Agents 1 Limited/Corbis" width="717" height="473" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/198.-Buddha.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The congregational worship in<strong> Borobudur</strong> is performed in a walking pilgrimage paying reverence to the stupa. This is achieved by circumambulating and keeping it on the right. The visitor is transformed and educated, while climbing through the levels of Borobudur. The encountering of illustrations of progressively more profound tales from Jataka and Avadana is achieved in a  similar way to the very early frescoes of the Ajanta Caves in India.</p>
<p>Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.</p>
<p><strong>Vesak, the “Buddha Day” ceremony, occurs once a year during a full moon</strong>. Thousands of Buddhist monks walk in solemn procession to Borobudur to commemorate the Buddha’s birth, death, and enlightenment. Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their teacher.</p>

<h5><strong>The Story</strong></h5>
<p>A window near the entrance to the tower tells the story of Noah and the flood. In the bottom diamond, God tells Noah he&#8217;ll destroy the earth. Subsequent panes show Noah building the ark, loading animals, waves covering the earth drowning the wicked, and Noah releasing a dove. Near the top is a rainbow, symbol of God’s promise never to bring another flood.</p>

<h5><strong>Annex: The tradition of the 1st image: King Udyana’s/Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty</strong></h5>
<p><strong>In Christian tradition</strong>, the legend of St. Luke the evangelist, who portrayed the virgin mother and the son, was developed roughly from the sixth to the eighth centuries, and propagated the idea that Christ’s image, but also that of his mother, the virgin, can be regarded as an historical portrait.</p>
<p><strong>The Buddhist tradition</strong> knows of a comparable legend about Buddha’s first image which was three dimensional and carved of sandalwood.</p>
<p><strong>King Udyana</strong> was distressed at not being able to behold the Enlightened One’s appearance, therefore Udyana decided to have a sandalwood image made, five feet in height. When the Buddha descended from the heaven of the thirty-three gods, he accepted it and pointed out the various merits achieved by image making.</p>
<p>This scene is illustrated in a stone relief from Gandhara, where we see the Buddha holding the image up in his hand and Udyana kneeling in front of him. In the late fifth century, the Udyana legend was linked with the story of the dream of Emperor Ming (58-76 CE) of the Han dynasty in the official tale of how Buddhism was introduced to China.</p>
<p>The new story claimed that the Buddha’s painting that the emperor received was in fact the same first image produced by King Udyana in the Buddha’s lifetime, thus giving authority to Chinese icons of the Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>The Udyana legend</strong> became embellished over time with details relating how one or many artisans were miraculously transported to the heavens to create the likeness of the living Buddha. Even today, there is an icon named the Udyana Shaka in Kyoto that is believed to be a direct copy of the legendary Udyana image that was brought from China to Japan by the monk Chonen in 985.</p>
<p>Seiryoji’s Shaka icon was always believed to embody miraculous powers that could be transferred to a replica if the copy was done with appropriate accuracy. The Udyāna story does not only establish the tradition of a first image in the likeness of the Enlightened One, but also makes a claim for the anthropomorphic Buddha image to be a divine image that is religiously efficacious, even to the point that it is equal to the extraordinary salvific powers of the Buddha’s relics.</p>
<p>The salvific efficacy of a divine image is affirmed by its ability to work miracles, which, once it happens, turns out to be not at all surprising, but rather expected and matter of fact. Furthermore, the type of miracles produced by images is foreseeable and consists primarily of various appearances of light and the self-induced movement of the image.</p>
<p>Stories about miraculous images were recorded in various text sources compiled during the sixth and seventh centuries. Within these miracle stories, a group of marvelous icons termed Aśoka images can be identified.</p>
<p>Historically, King Ashoka (reigned ca. 273-232 BCE) of the Maurya Dynasty left his famous stone edicts to testify to his widespread propagation of Buddhism, <strong>but at his time still no anthropomorphic Buddha images were known</strong>.</p>
<p>In China, his legend of having constructed 84, 000 relic stupas all over the world extended to sacred images. Even though stories of Ashoka images had become popular in the south of China, the notion of images possessing miraculous powers probably first arrived in the northern parts of China in the fifth century.</p>
<p>These Ashoka images are characterized not only by their wonder-working abilities, but also by their miraculous origin that is usually narrated in stories about wondrous discoveries.</p>
<p>One typical story about such images is a mural on the west side of the south wall in cave 323 at Dunhuang. Texts in accompanying cartouches state that two large Buddha statues on lotus pedestals came floating on the river Wu. Only the monks and believers in the Buddhist Law the wind and waves calmed down, and the statues could be taken to the monastery where they are worshipped until this very day</p>
<h5><strong>Annex: The Great Monkey King (Jat 407)</strong></h5>
<p>One day in Jetavana Monastery, Bhikkhus began talking about the good that the Buddha did for his relatives. When the Buddha asked them about their subject, and they told him, he said, &#8220;Bhikkhus, this is not the first time the Tathagata has done good works to benefit relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he told this story of the past.</p>
<p>Long, long ago, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the Bodhisatta was born as a monkey in the Himalayas. When he was fully grown, he was extremely strong and vigorous and became the leader of a troop of eighty thousand monkeys.</p>
<p>On the bank of the Ganges there was an enormous mango tree, with two massive branches so thick with leaves it looked like a mountain. Its sweet fruit was of exquisite fragrance and flavor. One branch spread over the bank of the river, but the other extended over the water.</p>
<p>One day, while the monkey king was eating the succulent fruit, he thought, &#8220;If any of this fruit ever fell into the river, great danger could come to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent this, he ordered the monkeys to pick all the mango flowers or tiny fruit from that branch. One fruit, however, was hidden by an ant&#8217;s nest and escaped the monkeys&#8217; attention. When it ripened, it fell into the river.</p>
<p>At that time, the King of Baranasi was bathing and amusing himself in the river. Whenever the king bathed in the river, he had nets stretched both upstream and downstream from where he was. The mango floated down the river and stuck in the net upstream from the king.</p>
<p>That evening, as the king was leaving, the fishermen pulled in the net and found the fruit. As they had never seen a fruit like this before, they showed it to the king.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this fruit?&#8221; the king asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not know, sire,&#8221; they answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The foresters, sire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The king summoned the foresters, who told him that the fruit was a mango. The king cut it with a knife and, after having the foresters eat some, tasted it himself. He also gave some of the fruit to the ministers and to his wives.</p>
<p>The king could not forget the magnificent flavor of the ripe mango. Obsessed with desire for the new fruit, he called the foresters again and asked where the tree stood. When he learned that it was on the bank of the river, he had many rafts joined together and sailed upstream to find it. In due course, the king and his retinue arrived at the site of the huge tree.</p>
<p>The king went ashore and set up a camp. After having eaten some of the delectable mangoes, he retired for the night on a bed prepared at the foot of the tree. Fires were lit and guards set on each side.</p>
<p>At midnight, after the men had fallen asleep and all was quiet, the monkey king came with his troop.</p>
<p>The eighty thousand monkeys moved from branch to branch eating mangoes. The noise woke the king, who roused his archers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surround those monkeys eating mangoes and shoot them,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Tomorrow we will dine on mango fruit and monkey&#8217;s flesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The archers readied their bows to obey the king. The monkeys saw the archers and realized that all means of escape had been cut off. Shivering in fear of death, they ran to their leader and cried, &#8220;Sire, there are men with bows all around the tree preparing to shoot us. What can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not fear,&#8221; he comforted them. &#8220;I will save your lives.&#8221; Then he climbed onto the branch stretching over the river. Springing from the end of it, he jumped a hundred bow-lengths and landed on the opposite bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Judging the distance, he had jumped, he thought, &#8220;That is how far I came.&#8221; Then he found a long vine and cut it, thinking, &#8220;This much will be fastened to a tree, and this much will go across the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>He secured one end of the vine to a sturdy tree and the other around his own waist. Then he again leapt across the river with the speed of a cloud blown by the wind. In his calculation, however, he had forgotten to include the length to be tied around his own waist, so he could not reach the trunk of the mango tree.</p>
<p>He reached out and grabbed the end of a branch firmly with both hands. He signaled to the troop of monkeys and cried, &#8220;Quick! Step on my back and run along this vine to safety. Good luck to you all!&#8221;</p>
<p>The eighty thousand monkeys, each in turn, respectfully saluted the monkey king, asked his pardon, and escaped in this way. The last monkey in the troop, however, had long resented the leader and wished to overthrow him. When he saw the monkey king hanging there, he exulted, &#8220;This is my chance to see the last of my enemy!&#8221; Climbing onto a high branch, he flung himself down on the monkey king&#8217;s back with a dreadful blow that broke his heart.</p>
<p>After he caused his rival excruciating pain, the wicked monkey triumphantly escaped and left the monkey king to suffer alone.</p>
<p>Having seen all that had happened as he lay on his bed, the king thought, &#8220;This noble monkey king, not caring for his own life, has ensured the safety of his troop. It would be wrong to destroy such an animal. I will have him brought down and taken care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ordered his men to lower the monkey gently down to a raft on the Ganges. After the monkey had been brought ashore and washed, the king anointed him with the purest oil. Spreading an oiled skin on his own bed and laying the monkey king on it, the king covered him with a yellow robe.</p>
<p>After the noble animal had been given sugared water to drink, the king himself took a low seat and addressed him. &#8220;Noble monkey, you made yourself a bridge for all the other monkeys to pass over to safety. What are you to them, and what are they to you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The monkey explained, &#8220;Great king, I guard the herd. I am their lord and chief. When they were filled with fear of your archers, I leapt a great distance to save them. After I had tied a vine around my waist, I returned to this mango tree. My strength was almost gone, but I managed to hold the branch so that my monkeys could pass over my back and reach safety. Because I could save them, I have no fear of death. Like a righteous king, I could guarantee the happiness of those over whom I used to reign. Sire, understand this truth! If you wish to be a righteous ruler, the happiness of your kingdom, your cities, and your people must be dear to you. It must be dearer than life itself.”</p>
<p>After teaching the king in this way, the monkey king died. The king gave orders that the monkey king should be given a royal funeral. He ordered his wives to carry torches to the cemetery with their hair disheveled. The ministers sent a hundred wagon loads of wood for the funeral pyre. When the regal ceremony was over, the ministers took the skull to the king.</p>
<p>The king built a shrine at the monkey&#8217;s burial place and made offerings of incense and flowers. He had the skull inlaid with gold, raised on a spear, and carried in front of the procession returning to Baranasi. There he put it at the royal gate and paid homage to it with incense and flowers. The whole city was decorated, and the skull was honored for seven days.</p>
<p>For the rest of his life the king revered the skull as a relic, offering incense and garlands. Established in the wonderful teaching of the monkey king, he gave alms and performed other good deeds. He ruled his kingdom righteously and became destined for heaven.</p>
<p>After the lesson, the Buddha declared the Truths and identified the Birth: &#8220;At that time the king was Ananda, the monkey retinue was this assembly, the wicked monkey was Devadatta, and I myself was the monkey king.”</p>
