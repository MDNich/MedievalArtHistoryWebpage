The study of artistic innovations and conventions developed in the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt provides a foundation for comparative understanding of subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artists and architects were influenced by earlier Mediterranean cultures. This provides the foundation for the exploration of art in Europe and the Americas. Here we can compare developments, consider continuities and changes over time, and build an understanding of how these works fit into a larger artistic tradition.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art of the Ancient Near East<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The art of the <strong>ancient Near East<\/strong>, today represents the countries of \u00a0<strong>Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Cyprus<\/strong>. Art from this area from <strong>3500 to 330 BCE<\/strong> is associated with successive city-states and cultural powers\u2014<strong>Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, NeoBabylonian, and Persian.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Religion <\/strong>also plays a significant role in the art and architecture of the ancient Near East. <strong>Cosmology<\/strong> is a force guiding representation of deities and kings who themselves assume divine attributes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art of Dynastic Egypt<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>art of dynastic Egypt<\/strong>, which in present-day is <strong>Egypt and Sudan<\/strong>, encompasses art from <strong>3000 to 300 BCE<\/strong>. It generally includes coverage of predynastic Egypt and <strong>Old, Middle<\/strong>, and <strong>New Kingdoms.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Amarna period or New KIngdom was also important because of its cultural reform and stylistic revolution. The art of dynastic Egypt embodies a sense of permanence. It was created for eternity in the service of a culture that focused on preserving a cycle of rebirth.<\/p>\n<p>Egyptian art incorporates <strong>mythological and religious symbolism<\/strong>, often centered on <strong>the cult of the sun<\/strong>. Representations of humans make clear distinctions between the deified pharaoh and people in lower classes. \u00a0It uses representational and stylistic cues such as hierarchical proportion and idealization versus naturalism.<\/p>\n<p>Approaches to portraiture depend on a figure\u2019s rank in society. The artistic canon of dynastic Egypt, with strict conventions of representation, use of materials, and treatment of forms, was followed for many centuries with only short-lived periods of experimentation and deviation. Innovations in art and architecture tended to occur within the basic and established scheme.<\/p>\n<p>*** See <a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/egyptian-art\/\">EGYPTIAN ART COLLECTIVE<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-254\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Tutankamuns-tomb-innermost-coffin.jpg?resize=300%2C829&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"829\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>MESOPTAMIAN ART<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The art of the <strong>ancient Near East<\/strong> (present day <strong>Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan<\/strong> , <strong>Cyprus<\/strong>) is associated with the <strong>city-states and cultures of Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Persia.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sumerian Art <\/strong>(3500 -2340 BCE)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Akkadian Art<\/strong> (2340 &#8211; 2180 BCE)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Neo-Sumerian Art<\/strong> (2150-2000 BCE)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Babylonian Art <\/strong>(1792-1750 BCE)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hittite Art<\/strong> (1600- 1200 BCE)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assyrian Art<\/strong> (1000- 612 BCE)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Neo-Babylonian<\/strong> (612-539 BCE)<\/p>\n<p>*** See the <a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/mesopotamian-art\/\">MESOPOTAMIAN ART COLLECTIVE<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-321\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Lion-Mosaic.png?resize=624%2C351&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Lion-Mosaic.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Lion-Mosaic.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Ancient Greek Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ancient Greek art was produced in <strong>Europe and western Asia<\/strong>, primarily in the region of <strong>present-day Greece, Turkey, and southern Italy<\/strong>, from <strong>600 BCE to 100 BCE<\/strong>.

This was first shared in voice and later written in text.\u00a0 It glorified the exploits of gods, goddesses, and heroes. The texts recorded a highly developed rhetorical tradition that prized public oratory and poetry. Religious rituals and prognostications were guided by oral tradition, not texts.<\/p>\n<p>Ancient Greek religious and civic architecture and figural representation are characterized by idealized proportions and spatial relationships, expressing societal values of harmony and order.<\/p>\n<p>Art from the Etruscan and Roman periods is typified by stylistic and iconographical eclecticism and portraiture. Roman architecture is also characterized by borrowing from its immediate predecessors (Greek and Etruscan) and by technical innovation.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Development of Ancient Mediterranean Art Forms<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art and art making take many different forms both within and across cultures. The materials, processes, and techniques employed may also vary by location and culture, with wide-ranging influence on the art that is generated.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sculpture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artists created fully developed, formal types, of art. Sculptures of human figures were made interacting with gods. Stylistic conventions that represented the human form combined <strong>profile and three-quarter view<\/strong>. In these combinations, important figures are set apart.\u00a0 Using a <strong>hierarchical scale<\/strong> or dividing the compositions into horizontal sections or registers, these sculptures provide significant early examples of historical narratives.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Architectural Construction<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Egyptian architectural construction of the clerestory is particularly important for the history of architecture. Development of monumental stone architecture culminated with the <strong>pyramids.<\/strong> These architectural masterpieces, with innovative designs for rock-cut tombs and pylons&#8211;the term for massive, sloped gateway.<\/p>\n<p>Each pyramid was built to demonstrate the importance of the pharaoh.

Originally, it was placed only in the tomb of dead kings, but later those of high rank were also included. In this case, it was for a scribe, that because of the profession\u2019s talent in writing, were given a priestly status.<\/p>\n<p>It depicts a scene of judgement complete with text and pictorial images. Only those with good ethics were deemed worthy to go into the afterlife. These images include gods and deities, and symbols of the afterlife such as lotus flowers and anks. There is a formality of stance, with traditional shaped bodies, and a twisted perspective. The text functions around the images and acts as a caption explaining the theme.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Created for Hu-Nefer<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was created especially for the patron <strong>Hu-Neufer, <\/strong>who was<strong> a royal scribe to Seti<\/strong>.\u00a0 He holds the hand of Anubis, the god of embalming, with a jackal\u2019s head, who leads him into a hall where his hands are being weighed against a feather. If his soul is heavier than a feather, he would be sent to the underworld. Here Ammit, the hippo\/lion\/crocodile eats the soul of the dead.<\/p>\n<p>The god Thoth, with the head of an ibis bird, records who gets to move forward in the book of life.\u00a0 The god Horus, with the head of a falcon, presents Hu-Nefer to Osiris, the god of the underworld, who is enthroned on the right. At the top, Hu-Nefer pleads his case to 42 judges. This is artistically simplified to 14.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 25.
