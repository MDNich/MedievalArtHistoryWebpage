The cult of Vishnu in India is known as Vaishnavite. <strong>Mentioned in the Vedas<\/strong>, he is a Vedic god and thus had a large following throughout the continent of India since the ancient past. Most importantly, Vishnu is the god who regularly incarnates on the earth whenever there arises a great force of evil.<\/p>\n<p>Vishnu appeared on the earth through ten reincarnations which consist of popular gods like Rama, Krishna, Parshurama, among six others. In addition, Vishnu also appears in a variety of other divine forms, among which Vaikunth Vishnu is also a significant one. The god with three heads and four hands, is a powerful emblem of taking charge of the preservation of life and beings. The three heads represent three combined incarnations viz. Narsimha, Varaha and Saumya.<\/p>\n<p>Facing east, the\u00a0<strong>garbha griha<\/strong>\u00a0is enclosed in a tall spire structure called\u00a0<strong>vimana.<\/strong> Tapering at the top, the\u00a0<strong>vimana\u00a0<\/strong>symbolizes refinement of human senses to achieve supreme bliss and union with God. The sanctum connects to an alley called\u00a0<strong>antarala<\/strong>, which is a connecting bridge to the sacred space with a secular one.<\/p>\n<p>But how?<\/p>\n<p>The sacred space of\u00a0<strong>garbha griha<\/strong>\u00a0opens to a hall with many decorative columns, in hypostyle format, which is called\u00a0<strong>mandapa<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>There are categories to\u00a0<strong>mandapa,<\/strong> which comprise\u00a0<strong>ardhamandapa<\/strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>sabhamandapa<\/strong>,<em>\u00a0<\/em>concerning the performed activities. These activities include religious duties, chanting, singing hymns in the praise of gods and goddesses, among others.\u00a0<strong>Mandapa<\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em>is a secular space, where every layman is allowed to visit and pray.<\/p>\n<p>The interior of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong> is made with corbeled arch, a style of overlapping masonry, which is pressured on the ground for stability. This is known as <strong>Ashlar masonry<\/strong> with stones fitted using rivets instead of mortar or nails. Artists have used <strong>horror vacui<\/strong>, defining the profuse decoration on the outside walls. Significantly, the southern walls of the temple show intimate sexual poses of a male-female union.<\/p>\n<p>The temple sculpture in ancient India followed the aesthetics of <strong>rasa<\/strong> (acquiring relish) and\u00a0<strong>Taalmana<\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em>(proportion) to create evocative artworks. Hence, the figures are curvy, tall, slender, and extremely rhythmic. Moreover, they are lyrical, moving the gaze subtly and effectively. Artists were able to achieve this remarkable feat of precision because of <strong>sandstone, which is soft and workable<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2034\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2034\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/200-C.jpg?resize=750%2C502&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/200-C.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/200-C.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Detail<br \/>\u00a9 Michele Burgess\/Alamy<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Apart from erotic couples called\u00a0<strong>mithuna,<\/strong> there are high reliefs of over 600 gods from Hindu pantheons. The short capitals show the form of lions, while before a devotee circumambulates the temple, the statue of Lord Ganesha assures of the correct revolving path. Significantly, in India, Lord Ganesha is worshipped by all creeds before initiating a new chapter of life. The human figurines are adorned with many accessories denoting royalness.<\/p>\n<p>The interior of the Lakshmana Temple is equally decorated with the narration of the lives of gods. Incarnations of Vishnu, Krishna Leela (tale), among many other narrative panels enliven the temple with the traditional culture of India. Based on Indian aesthetic theories, the placement of sculptures allots figures of speech (<em>alamkara<\/em>) quality. Hence, they suggest an abstract philosophy over describing it through inscriptions. The aesthetics of suggestions in Indian aesthetic theory is called\u00a0<em>dhvani<\/em>. Through love-making scenes on the temple, the importance of sex as a means to higher consciousness is emphasized by the ruling dynasty of Chandella.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Primarily, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple serves as the worshipping place of Lord Vishnu<\/strong>. The Hindu temples are deemed as a residing space for the god among the common masses. Visiting the temple, the devotee circumambulates the shrine to activate the divine energy and pay symbolic reverence and dedication. Most importantly, they should circumambulate in a clockwise direction.<\/p>\n<p>The Chandella kingdom followed the Vaishnaivite cult and to address social legitimacy, they built many temples. It also showed their piety. With respect to political agenda, they would often borrow the model of deity from the neighboring kingdom to maintain the cordial relation. In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple,<\/strong> king Yashovarman had followed the same method. However, it is stated that the present idol in the temple is not an original one.<\/p>\n<p>Rulers are depicted in tantric sex poses, which were seen as a kind of offering to the deities. The theme of the building is preservation (this is what Vishnu embodies): whether it be sexual prolonging or preservation of human life (through reproduction).<\/p>\n<p>The ancient Indian temples are solid proof of profound study, which are documented in the doctrines called\u00a0<strong>shastras.<\/strong> From the studies in the science of construction to the study of making love is practically demonstrated and celebrated in these documents.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong>, the legacy of architecture and art is combined with tantric philosophy, which presents a spiritual significance to sex. According to Tantrism, the union of the male and female body develops proximity with god.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Shilpashashtra and Kamasutra are ancient Indian texts on the art of sculpting and lovemaking, respectively. The main architect of the temple is known as Sutradhar or a Vishwakarma, a person who designs and directs the construction. Indian traditional doctrines are also replete with information to plan the building, as well as instructions to create a sculpture concerning the essential aesthetics. These structures of information have proven to be textbooks to the generation of artists in making high-relief or free-standing sculptures. Majorly, the narratives have been borrowed from ancient texts like Vedas, Puranas, and epics.<\/p>\n<p>Presenting a Vaikunth Vishnu idol in the sanctum, the Chandela kings propagated Vaisnavism. However, they also promoted Jainism and had also supported the construction of Jain temples.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Yashvoraman, a Chandella king, in 930 AD, augmented the construction of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong>, which eventually was completed during his son\u2019s rule. A guild of artists was employed to finish the massive plan of the temple. Concerning the ruler\u2019s desire to stand it out from the rest, a few changes were observed.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong>, the notion of sculpting erotic poses on the junctures was novel and performed for the first time. It is an example of using one of the figures of speech (<em>alamkara<\/em>) called\u00a0<em>slesha\u00a0<\/em>or pun. The temple was and is open to the visitors to seek the blessings of the preserver deity, Vishnu. It is one of the world heritage sites of India.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Lakshmana temple was constructed between 930 &#8211; 1050 CE. Yashovarman of the Chandella dynasty built many temples in Khajurao with an exemplary amount of exterior as well as interior decoration. Thus, it initiated the nomenclature of Chandela art and architecture with specific significance.

Hence, the sculpture is an eye opener in the chaotic world, where we tend to forget the higher purpose of life, while following a dogmatic routine.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why this was Created<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> is a cult statue dedicated to Lord Shiva, a prominent Hindu god. One of the oldest religions of India, Hinduism had been a pivotal belief in addressing the meanings of icons used in art forms. The doctrine Shilpashastra is the most important in ancient Indian literature that compulsively dominates the form, style, and composition of early Indian sculpture.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> condenses the ancient iconography of India, embodying the divine. It was created to anesthetize the laws of the universe into a narrative that can relate as well as connect to the common mass. It emulates the dancing form from the doctrine called Natyashastra, a book of theatre. Thus, it was a cult statue throughout the sub-religions of India.<\/p>\n<p>The sculpture of Shiva was first made <strong>in a dancing pose<\/strong> for temples during the 5th and 6th century CE as relief sculptures. The free-standing sculpture began to be made in the 10th century and <strong>preferably in bronze<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Around the 11th century, Nataraja statues were carried in processional parades, comprising priests and devotees. As a concept of commemoration, the Natraja idols would be <strong>covered with red and green cloth, surrounded by candles and flowers<\/strong>. The presence of the god in the statue, or deifying the idol, comes into being when a devotee worships it with immense faith.<\/p>\n<p>Indian art was based on the fundamental principles of art and aimed at evoking the inherent emotion <strong>(bhava)<\/strong> of the art piece into the audience called\u00a0<strong>rasa<\/strong>. The experience of expected <strong>rasa<\/strong> in the viewers is the marker of the successful artwork. Hence, developing an enormous reverence to the holy process of annihilation, which will inevitably become the ground of creation, Natraja follows this indoctrinated philosophy of art sincerely.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Composed in a balanced format, this bronze sculpture is from the Chola dynasty of the 10th century. The Chola artist employed the <strong>lost wax process<\/strong> or Cire perdue technique of casting. Hence<strong><em>, Natraja<\/em><\/strong> is also created with the same process. The cire perdue entails a long process of forming a wax model to prepare a core around it and pouring the molten metal either to produce a hollow or a solid cast.<\/p>\n<p>During the Chola period, bronze casting was in vogue, which is proved by a range of artifacts of a variety of Indian gods available in diverse collections. Significantly, these sculptures project stone temple carvings&#8217; style along with the iconographical features, which purports a commendable merger of technique and aesthetics. With the instruction from Shilpashastra, the\u00a0<em>talman\u00a0<\/em>or the proportion for the divine figures was preordained. The doctrine also commands how limbs should be styled, underlining Hindu ideology.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2086\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/202.-Teacher-with-Shiva.jpg?resize=497%2C663&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"497\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/202.-Teacher-with-Shiva.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/202.-Teacher-with-Shiva.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/202.-Teacher-with-Shiva.jpg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/202.-Teacher-with-Shiva.jpg?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Chola dynasty served as a patron to <strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> or <strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance<\/em><\/strong>.

From the 800s to the 1300s it was a prosperous hydraulic facility that collected monsoon waters from the rainy season, in huge basins. This elevated flooding, and protected plantations during drought.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Merchants and traders of gold and spices brought Hinduism and later Buddhism<\/strong>. Business opportunities caused people to stay in the region<\/p>\n<p>Since Angkor itself was the technical source of the life-giving agricultural water controlled by the king, it was regarded by the Khmer with religious reverence. Its temples and palaces were an expression of that and at the same time an essential part of its supernatural mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>Royal intercession by numerous ceremonies, some of which re-enacted the primal marriage of Hindu divinity and native earth spirit on the pattern of ancient folk cult, ensured the continuing gift of the waters of heaven.<\/p>\n<p>The king, an earthly image of his god, was the intermediary who ensured that his kingdom would continue to receive divine benevolence in the form of water in controlled quantities.<\/p>\n<p>Courtiers played roles both religious and administrative for the king, who believed that after his death he would be united with his patron deity. Dedicatory statues were often set up in his chief temple to commemorate his divinization.<\/p>\n<p>The Khmer kings were tied to the city, even as they changed religions. The city was transformed using both Hindi and Mahayana Buddhist architecture and artistic style layers beneath the surface of the temple.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2063\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2063\" style=\"width: 818px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2063\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/199.-B.jpg?resize=818%2C520&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"818\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/199.-B.jpg?w=323&amp;ssl=1 323w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/199.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2063\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Gate of Angkor Thom<br \/>\u00a9 Christophe Boisvieux\/Corbis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A large moat and a high wall surround Angkor Wat on all sides, which are longer than one kilometer.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the temple develops on three levels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a new enclosure, formed of galleries, pierced with monumental porches on all four sides and provided with corner towers<\/li>\n<li>a <strong>second floor<\/strong> repeating the same arrangement<\/li>\n<li>a <strong>central tower<\/strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries staggered and interconnected by cruciform galleries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>temple mountain<\/strong> was a Southeast Asian invention in architecture.

Their engineering feats not only provided their inhabitants with a <strong>constant water source<\/strong> but tied their destiny to the <strong>ancient world trade routes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In both cities, the merchants-navigators and caravans of the vast-reaching trading routes brought along their ideas. Think Hinduism and later Buddhism. They also brought traditions like Hellenistic architecture and the Greco-Roman model of interconnected public spaces.\u00a0 This <strong>transformed the local cultures<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Angkor Thom<\/strong>, capital of the Ancient Cambodian Khmer Empire was an important center along the <strong>gold and spices<\/strong> trade networks of East and Southeast Asia. <strong>Petra<\/strong> the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom controlled the <strong>Incense Routes<\/strong> providing Arabian <strong>myrrh, frankincense and perfume<\/strong> to the Mediterranean cities and Dead Sea <strong>bitum<\/strong> for the ships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ancient Petra (400 BCE-100CE)<\/strong> and <strong>Angkor Thom<\/strong> urbanism ideas could not be more different.<\/p>\n<p>The advent <strong>Angkor Wat <\/strong>(800-1400 CE) was announced by the Khmer royal tradition of building temple-mountains to their ancestors. The <strong>temple mountain<\/strong> was a Southeast Asian architectural invention to illustrate the union between the gods and the reigning king.<\/p>\n<p>The Khmer capital was a gigantic square symbolizing the whole universe. Two axial avenues crossed it, ending in a natural hill at the center.\u00a0 In the beginning of the 12th century, King Suryavarman II (1113-1145\/50 C.E.) built the temple of <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong>. He became the first king of the Angkor dynasty.<\/p>\n<p>The original name of the temple was lost. Angkor Wat means <strong>City Temple<\/strong>. The temple was dedicated to <strong>Vishnu<\/strong>, the Protector, one of the three main Hindu gods, Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma.\u00a0 The galleries of its three ascending levels and the moat <strong>symbolized the oceans that surround Mt. Meru<\/strong>, the home of Hindu gods. The last level is a <strong>central tower<\/strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries arranged in staggered rows symbolizing the five mountain ranges of Mt. Meru itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Angkor\u2019s<\/strong> central axis given by temple&#8217;s main tower also aligns to the morning sun of the Spring Equinox. This <strong>axis-mundi<\/strong> is a <strong>cosmic axis connecting heaven and earth<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The effort demanded by the construction of <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong> weakened the kingdom. It was briefly occupied by the Champa people of Vietnam.<\/p>\n<p>Jayavarman VII liberated his country and changed his religion switching from the defeated Vishnu to Buddhism (Mahayana). The Buddhist cosmology inspired new constructions such as Preah Khan and Bayon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong> survived as its plan allowed for its re-interpretation as a <strong>mandala <\/strong>or circle in Sanskrit. This is <strong>a spiritual geometric configuration<\/strong> that teaches believers the <strong>Four Noble Truths<\/strong> and the organization of the universe.\u00a0 Its architects used the Hindu architecture for a Buddhist temple by replacing the typical Buddhist stupa, with the Mt. Meru. The believers circumambulated in the galleries around the staggered Mt. Meru. Raising level by level the believers understood the concept of eternal rebirth samsara and of enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the architecture of <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong> remained accompanied by a mostly Hindu bas-relief decoration including over a thousand dancing apsaras (female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist culture) the allegories of Hindu deliverance from demons such as the <strong><em>Churning of the Sea of Milk<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0in which the Devas (gods) fight the asura (demons) to reclaim order and power.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Petra\u2019s<\/strong> urbanism is far away from any geometrical planning. Dictated by the natural fragmented rocky environment of its surrounding sandstone cliffs, it did not allow the development of the traditional Greco-Roman grid patterns and resulted in a low-density urban network. In the early 1st century, during the reign of King Aretas IV, <strong>Petra\u2019s <\/strong>cosmopolitan population peaked at almost 25,000 people and the heart of the city of <strong>Petra<\/strong> covered the bottom of the valley.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-369\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?resize=658%2C495&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?w=408&amp;ssl=1 408w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Indianana-Jones-at-Petra.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The city borrowed the <strong>Greco-Roman concept of public space<\/strong> with a monumental Roman-style theater carved directly into the sandstone bedrock, the two levels administrative\/religious center of the \u201cGreat Temple\u201d, and a colonnade street with portico. Its main axis followed the topography of Wadi Musa spring torrent.<\/p>\n<p>After Trajan\u2019s victory in 106 CE, the Roman conquerors built a colonnaded street on <strong>Petra<\/strong><strong>\u2019s<\/strong> main axis connecting all its key centers.\u00a0 A Roman triple-arched gate marked the access to <strong>Petra<\/strong><strong>\u2019s<\/strong> old sacred quarter featuring Qasr el Bin, an ashlar-masonry square shrine and the colonnaded Winged Lions Temple. Both temples were dedicated to Nabatean Arabian idols.<\/p>\n<p>Like <strong>Angkor Wat,<\/strong> in <strong>Petra<\/strong> the civil Hellenistic tradition was used for a different religious purpose. The Eastern cult of the dead created the unique rock-cut mausoleums of <strong>Petra<\/strong>. The result was so atypical that for a long time <strong>Petra<\/strong> was refused the status of a proper city and it was simply considered a necropolis.<\/p>\n<p>The mausoleums line is at the entrance to the valley and crowns the cliffs surrounding the valley. The monumental Al-Khazneh, <strong>The Treasury<\/strong>\u2014 with its broken pediment and deeply carved tholos topped by a stone urn, Corinthian columns and reliefs of winged Victories, bare breasted Amazons and Castor and Polux\u2014 illustrates <strong>a flamboyant Alexandrian Hellenistic style<\/strong>. It draws a stark contrast with the <strong>Street of Facades<\/strong> and its smaller Eastern aniconic mausoleums with flat Mesopotamian roofs.<\/p>\n<p>A row of rock-cut monumental columned tombs, <strong>The Royal tombs<\/strong> crowns the heights of the city itself. Their facades carved in the <strong>sandstone<\/strong> exhibit <strong>syncretic architectural elements<\/strong>: multi-storied Mesopotamian facades, Egyptian monumentality and Hellenistic colonnades and pediments. The <strong>Palace Tomb<\/strong> is the largest, the <strong>Corinthian Tomb<\/strong> has floral decorative elements, and the <strong>Silk Tomb<\/strong> has a wavy moir\u00e9 rock fa\u00e7ade.<\/p>\n<p>Other monuments carved into the towering cliffs, such as <strong>Ad-Deir<\/strong>, or the Monastery were initially considered tombs. Ad-Deir Hellenistic architecture elements strikingly resembles ones of the Al-Khazneh, <strong>The Treasury<\/strong> showing the continuous experimentation of <strong>Petra\u2019s <\/strong>architects with different cultural elements.\u00a0 However, its austere decorations featuring circle-patterns is a legacy of the Nabataean non-figurative artistic tradition. <strong>Crosses etched onto the walls<\/strong> show that the Byzantines re-used it later as a church.<\/p>\n<p>At <strong>Petra<\/strong> the recycling of monuments and integration of new ideas in the Nabatean did not stop with Nabataean Ptolemaic and Roman rulers. In the Byzantine period, mausoleums were converted into churches, and the spolia of damaging earthquakes served to construct new Christian Byzantine monuments.<\/p>\n<p>At <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong> and <strong>Petra <\/strong>art waned when their multicultural societies were threatened by the raise of religious intolerance.\u00a0 The religious sites of Angkor Thom and Petra faced a methodical Hindu and respectively Muslim iconoclasm. This destroyed in <strong>Angkor<\/strong> all the effigies of the Buddha and in <strong>Petra<\/strong> all the human and animal faces.<\/p>\n<h3>BUDDHISM<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2107\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=990%2C654&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/198.-Buddha.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations: Buddhism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture, sculpture, and painting are utilized together.<\/li>\n<li>Stupas (B) devised around cosmic lines<\/li>\n<li>Uniformity to how Buddha is depicted, regardless of time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Examples of Buddhist Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<h5><strong>Cycles<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em>Reincarnation, karma<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Buddhism and the Buddha<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Great Stupa at Sanchi India<br \/>\n<\/strong>4 century BCE 50 feet tall<br \/>\nKing Ashoka, Circumambulation, torana, Yakshi<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seated Buddha<\/strong><br \/>\nGandhara style Pakistan, 2 century CE stone 2 feet<br \/>\nUrna, ushnisha<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Life and Death of the Buddha <\/strong><br \/>\nPakistan, 2nd century CE, schist 2 feet by 9 inches<br \/>\nBondi Tree, Sarnath<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Silk Road <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Colossal Buddha of Bamiyan<\/strong><br \/>\nAfghanistan, 2nd century CE 180 feet tall<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seated Buddha preaching the first sermon<\/strong><br \/>\nIndia, 5th century CE, tan sandstone, 5 feet high<br \/>\nMathura Style<\/p>\n<p><strong>Longmen Caves <\/strong><br \/>\nChina 5th \u2013 12th century CE, limestone<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jowo Rinpoche <\/strong><br \/>\nTibet, 7th century CE, gilt metals with semiprecious stones, pearls, and paint<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daibutsuden (Kondo) of the Todai-ji complex<\/strong><br \/>\nJapan 8 century CE, rebuilt 18 century CE, wood, bronze, and ceramic tiles<br \/>\nCurtain walls, modular, mortise and tenon<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Great Buddha of Todai-ji Gate<\/li>\n<li>Nio Guardian Statue of Todai-ji<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Borobudur Temple Indonesia<\/strong><br \/>\n9th century CE volcanic stone masonry<br \/>\nMandala<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ryoan-ji Gardens<\/strong><br \/>\nJapan, 15th century CE<br \/>\nZen Buddhism<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Buddhism and Monasteries<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>What is a Monastery?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A monastery is a community for men, as monks, or woman as nuns. The word monk is from the Greek word <strong>monos<\/strong> which means to be alone.\u00a0 Here, they form a new society for themselves, which is devoted to religious practices, including prayer and rituals.<\/p>\n<p>Before monasteries were built both Buddhist and Christian monks had to rely solely on the kindness of others.

This is thought to be a repetitive state. But, when someone finally reaches <strong>moksha<\/strong>, this is when release from samsara occurs. This ends attachment to both the material world and the ego. In this state nirvana or liberation is reached. This is the final state in which there is <strong>oneness with everything<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The prayers and meditations are thought to help the community, as the common person would not possess the proper skills. Although they could turn to the monastery for instruction as well.\u00a0 The people of the community can improve their <strong>karma<\/strong>, by giving donations of food and other useful items to the monastery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dharma<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are <strong>Four Noble Truths<\/strong>, also known as <strong>Dharma<\/strong> or the law.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Life is suffering (suffering = rebirth) <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>The cause of suffering is desire. <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>The cause of desire must be overcome.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>When desire is overcome, there is no more suffering (suffering = rebirth)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is understood that moksha is extremely difficult to achieve.

He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand.<\/p>\n<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the Mahayana School, Buddha was a savior and often a god\u2014a god concerned with man\u2019s sorrows above all else. The <strong>Mahayana form of Buddhism<\/strong> is in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vajrayana <\/strong>is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, with many rituals which define it as different. It is practiced mostly in Tibet, Mongolia and in parts of China.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Similarities:<\/strong> Buddha was the founder, and they all follow the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Basic Differences:<\/strong> attainment of Nirvana. Only monks can obtain Nirvana in Theravada, as is traditional Buddhism. In the Mahayana form of Buddhism followers believe that everyone can.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Hinduism vs. Buddhism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Buddhism arose from Hinduism. Both believe in reincarnation, karma, and working toward a good life to ultimately achieve enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p>Hinduism has a caste system, while Buddhism does not. It does not have the rituals, priest or gods and goddesses that the Hindus do.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>An Inspiration for Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Three types of architecture were inspired by Buddhist communal and monastic spaces.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stupa<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Vihara<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Chaitya<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>stupa<\/strong> came first. It is considered a sepulchral monument or a place for burial or receptacle for relics. Typical items would include objects or items the person wore. After monasteries started to be built, these items were removed from the <strong>stupa<\/strong> and they were left to simply become symbols of Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p>The original <strong>stupa<\/strong> was important. It was built by the first Buddhist ruler of India, named Ashoka.<\/p>\n<p>Between 120 BCE and 200 C.E. over 1000 <b><i>viharas<\/i><\/b> (a monastery with residence hall for the monks), and <strong>chaityas<\/strong> (a stupa monument hall), were established along ancient and prosperous trade routes.

Merchants, wealthy from the trade between the Roman Empire and southeast Asia, often sponsored architectural additions including pillars, arches, reliefs and fa\u00e7ades to the caves. Buddhist monks, serving as missionaries, often accompanied traders throughout India, up into Nepal and Tibet, spreading the dharma as they travelled.<\/p>\n<p>During <strong>Hinayana (lesser vehicle)<\/strong> the memory of historical Buddha and his teachings were recent, so there were no images of Buddha. Eventually, the rock-cut monasteries became quite complex. They consisted of several stories with inner courtyards and veranda.<\/p>\n<p>In the later Mahayana (greater vehicle) phase, there was a need for physical reminders of the Buddha and his teachings. Images of the Buddha drawn from the jataka stories\u2014the life stories of the Buddha\u2014, or of the Buddha performing his Enlightenment and his first sermon (when he shared the Four Noble Truths with the laity) proliferated in both paintings and reliefs. A stupa was still placed in the central hall, but now an image of the Buddha was carved into it, underscoring that Buddha is the stupa.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Early Caves in Northern India: Bhaja, Ajanta<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2096\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?resize=650%2C488&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Bhaja-Caves-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At <strong>Bhaja<\/strong> there are no representations of the Buddha other than the stupa since Bhaja was an active monastery during <strong>the earliest phase of Buddhism<\/strong>, <em>Hinayana<\/em> (lesser vehicle), when no images of the Buddha were created. In <em>Hinayana<\/em>, the memory of the historical Buddha and his teachings were still a very real part of the practice. The Buddha himself did not encourage worship of him (something images would encourage), but desired that the practitioner focus on the <em>dharma<\/em> (the law, the Four Noble Truths).<\/p>\n<p>The main <em>chaitya<\/em> hall (which contained a memorial stupa, empty of relics) at Bhaja contains a solid stone stupa in the nave flanked by two side aisles. It is the earliest example of this type of rock-cut cave and closely resembles the wooden structures that preceded it. The columns slope inwards, which would have been necessary in the early wooden structures in the north of India to support the outward thrust from the top of the vault. In similar stone caves, sometimes the columns are placed in stone pots, which mimic the stone pots the wooden columns were positioned in, to thwart termites. This is an example of a practical architectural practice being adopted as the standard.<\/p>\n<p>At <strong>Ajanta<\/strong>, the earliest phase of construction also belongs to the Hinayana (lesser vehicle) phase of Buddhism (in which no human image of the Buddha was created). The caves are very similar to those at Bhaja. During the second phase of construction, Buddhism was in the <strong>Mahayana<\/strong> (greater vehicle) phase and <strong>images of the Buddha<\/strong>, predominantly drawn from the jataka stories\u2014the life stories of the Buddha\u2014were painted throughout.<\/p>\n<p>In Mahayana, which was more distant in time from the life of the Buddha, there was a need for physical reminders of the Buddha and his teachings. Thus images of the Buddha performing his Enlightenment and his first sermon (when he shared the Four Noble Truths with the laity) proliferated. The paintings at Ajanta provide some of the earliest and finest examples of Buddhist painting from the period. The images also provide documentation of contemporary events and social custom under Gupta reign (320-550 C.E.).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Buddhism Iconisn-Aniconism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The \u201caniconic mode\u201d of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism<\/strong> developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that <strong>never show the Buddha in human form<\/strong>. Instead, <strong>his presence was indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations<\/strong> as well as by his \u201cnon-image.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the <strong>Chinese aniconic phase<\/strong> refrained from any pictorial representation whatsoever and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy<\/strong>. The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The icon (corporeal body) of the Buddha in India and China: Gandhara style<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2097\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Icon.jpg?resize=802%2C613&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"802\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Icon.jpg?w=420&amp;ssl=1 420w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Icon.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After the 1st century C.E., <strong>with the development of Mahayana Buddhism<\/strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form.

At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Influence of Alexander the Great<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Gandhara<\/strong> is the ancient name of a region in <strong>northwest Pakistan<\/strong>.

Before Buddha, teachers and philosophers were buried in stupas (Hindu funerary monuments). The shape was supposed to represent a person seated in meditation.<\/p>\n<p>In the 6th century BCE stupas built after Buddhism contained portions of the Buddha\u2019s ashes (not known exactly when Buddha died for sure). There were 8 stupas originally because there were 8 kings who wanted to split the remains.<\/p>\n<p>In the 3rd century BCE Great Stupa was one of the oldest and best-preserved stupas from Ashoka\u2019s reign. Ashoka was the greatest Mauryan king in India and the first ruler to associate with Buddhism in India. He converted after killing 100,000 people. When he converted, he disinterred Buddha\u2019s remains from the other stupas and distributed the remains to his new stupas.<\/p>\n<p>Ashoka built many stupas across his empire so the faithful could always access them.

The Queen was Queen Wencheng, daughter of the Tang Chinese emperor. She is credited with bringing Buddhism to Tibet when she married King Gampo in 641 CE. Part of her dowry was the <strong>Jowo Rinpoche<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>On her way to Tibet from China, her wagon got stuck in the mud. This was interpreted as the Jowo Rinpoche wanting to stay on that spot, so construction began on a temple. Every day when workers returned to the site, the construction they had done the previous day had been undone. This continued for 6 years!<\/p>\n<p>Finally, a divination revealed that an ancient demoness was sleeping in the earth under the exact spot where they were building the temple. Every night, she would push her arms and legs, while thrashing around, wrecking the construction on the temple. To stop this, <strong>the main<\/strong> <strong>Jokhang Temple<\/strong> was built on her heart to weigh her down and prove Buddhism\u2019s supremacy, and <strong>ten smaller temples<\/strong> were built around Jokhang Temple to hold down her arms and legs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Development of Vajrayana Buddhism (Tantric Buddhism)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>A further evolution of Mahayana Buddhism<\/strong>, Vajrayana (Sanskrit: \u201cThunderbolt Vehicle\u201d or \u201cDiamond Vehicle\u201d) form of Buddhism that was developed in India about 500\u2013600 C.E. in India and neighbouring countries, especially Tibet. It was based on the traditions of late (600) Indian and Chinese Buddhism with a strong emphasis on monasticism.<\/p>\n<p>Unique to Tibetan Buddhism is the institution of the tulku (incarnate lama): <strong>Tibetan Buddhists believe that compassionate teachers are reborn again and again, in each lifetime. <\/strong>Identified when they are children and invested with the office and prestige of their previous rebirths.

Tibet was incorporated into China in 1951, and the present (Fourteenth) Dalai Lama went into exile in India in 1959, when the Tibetan diaspora began. Since that time, Tibetan Buddhism has become of increasing interest to people throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p>Based on a sophisticated scholastic philosophy that can be traced to ancient Hindu and Vedic texts, the followers of Vajrayana Buddhism believe in <strong>a shortcut to enlightenment through psychological\/physiological transformations<\/strong>. This involves elaborate forms of tantric practice believed to be handed out by Buddha to selected disciples to recapture his own enlightenment experience.

Romanesque.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A relic is an object that is esteemed or venerated because of association with a sanctified historical person<\/strong>. Catholic churches have a long history of collecting and venerating relics. The more closely something was associated with Christ, the more spiritually valuable it was.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who was Sainte-Foy?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Sainte Foy (English: Saint Faith) was born in the French\/Roman 2<sup>nd<\/sup> century city of Agen. She became a martyr when she was killed by the Romans by refusing to worship pagan gods. She was only 12 years old.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Her skull became the relic<\/strong> that pilgrims wanted to visit. It was believed that it cured blindness.<\/p>\n<p>There are formal characteristics shared by both <strong><em>Jowo Rinpoche and<\/em> <em>Reliquary of Sainte Foy<\/em> <\/strong>\u00a0that relate to their association with relics . Each is shaped as a human whose pose, expression, and embellishment, indicate the core beliefs associated with the relics.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figural sculptures<\/li>\n<li>Static, rigid postures and bilateral symmetry<\/li>\n<li>Expressionless faces<\/li>\n<li>Reflective luster of the surfaces<\/li>\n<li>Seated position<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The rigid, static pose of these figures and their bilateral symmetry reflect a separation from earthly concerns and suggest a spiritual transcendence. This is also communicated through their <strong>calm, expressionless faces<\/strong>. Likewise, the <strong>reflective luster of the surfaces evokes an association with the spiritual realm<\/strong>. Finally, the seated positions of the figures convey different ideas.<\/p>\n<p>The enthroned Sainte-Foy reflects the heavenly majesty of a sainted Christian marty, while the Jowo Rinopoche lotus position and \u201ccalling the earth as witness\u201d mudra reflect his enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p>The materials\/imagery used reinforce the reliquary Sainte-Foy\u2019s association with relics.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Materials<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>gold and silver<\/strong> convey the heavenly rewards (of Christian martyrdom)<\/p>\n<p>The Reliquary of Sainte-Foy is a female figure enthroned and richly embellished. The figure is <strong>sculpted in wood and plated in gold and silver gilt repouss\u00e9<\/strong>. Cabochon <strong>gems and enameling<\/strong> add to the lavish presentation.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the gemstones encrusting the surface were donated by pilgrims as part of their veneration.<\/p>\n<p>There are <strong>elements of ancient Roman art<\/strong>. The head of the saint is a reused ancient Roman sculpture and antique cameos are found on the exterior. This links the reliquary to the Christian persecution era, corresponding with the age of the relics contained inside. This use of spolia (repurposed art) makes the object even greater in value by associating it with the treasures of the Roman Empire and by linking the sculpture to the era in which Sainte-Foy was martyred.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0Imagery<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The youthful appearance of the figure which recalls the story of the 12-year-old martyr who refused to renounce her Christian faith.<\/li>\n<li>The blank stare of the figure reflects a spiritual transcendence from earthly life.<\/li>\n<li>The jeweled crown or throne that evokes the heavenly majesty of a sainted Christian martyr.<\/li>\n<li>The lamb imagery and crucifixion scene at the base of the throne parallels the martyr\u2019s sacrifice with that of Jesus Christ.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Their function is associated with movement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>with a destination to which pilgrims travel<\/li>\n<li>a relic\/reliquary is a fixed object in a specific location: a pilgrimage on a known route.<\/li>\n<li>Their function is religious and cannot be explained outside a Christian\/Buddhist context.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>reliquary of Sainte-Foy<\/strong> is synonymous with its Christian context. Its function cannot be seen, considered, or described without reference to the Church of Sainte-Foy. The object does have a more varied history. The saint\u2019s remains were transferred from Agen to Conques in the 9th century, and the head of the statue is widely believed to be a repurposed imperial portrait from the later Roman Empire. Yet the fundamental religious function of the reliquary of Sainte-Foy has remained the same for centuries.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Jowo Rinpoche<\/strong> despite the historical evidence is <strong>seen as a relic of the historical Buddha<\/strong>, carved by a celestial architect to serve as Buddha\u2019s proxy after he leaves Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Both works function is to express the power of their relics. The access to them is institutional, held by a religious order and held on display to be viewed by the public.<\/p>\n<p>Once a year, on the saint\u2019s feast day, the reliquary is paraded in a glass case through the town of Conques so that it may be viewed and venerated by large crowds. The reliquary also protects the relics. The actual relics of Sainte-Foy are not seen. They are believed to be engaged through prayer and contemplation during the pilgrimage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jowo Rinpoche<\/strong> was built to act as a proxy of Buddha after he left Earth.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Difference in function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The relics of Sainte-Foy are never seen<\/li>\n<li>Buddha relic, Jowo Rinpoche is permanently on display<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>(3)<em> 95.

It was probably added to hold together the bottom story, which began to spread under the pressure of the immense weight of earth and stone accumulated above.<\/p>\n<p>The lowest level, which is partially hidden, contains reliefs of earthly desires, illustrating \u201cthe realm of feelings\/desires\u201d, <strong>the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe<\/strong>. It portrays the law of cause and effect. For example, if you like gossiping, you might be reborn with an ugly appearance.<\/p>\n<p>The next level is a 13-foot-wide corridor open to the sky and adorned with bas-reliefs that depict \u201cthe realm of forms\u201d through events in the life of the historical Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas. There are 2 registers: the balustrade depicting fables about altruism.<\/p>\n<p>Opposite the balustrade is the main wall where the Jatakas stories are located.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lalitavistara<\/strong>, a set of 120 reliefs on the first platform, depict Prince Siddharta\u2019s life from birth to enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p>Queen Maya riding \u00a0in a horse carriage is retreating to Lumbini garden to give birth to Prince Siddhartha. In the nativity scene, Queen Maya&#8217;s depiction recalls the tree spirits or yakshinis. These spirits are are often shown as beautiful and voluptuous, with a flywhisk in right hand, fleshy cheeks, wide hips, narrow waists, broad shoulders, knotted hair and exaggerated, spherical breasts. According to legend, the infant stood and took seven steps. With each step, a lotus flower appeared, to prevent his tiny feet from touching the ground.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Here is the Story<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Siddharta was born to King Sudhodana and Queen Maya of the Sakya clan who reigned in Kosala, India, around the fifth century BC. One day Queen Maya had a dream of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was interpreted by priests as a sign that the couple would bear a son, who would become either a world ruler or a Buddha. The king preferred him to be the world ruler, so he confined the prince in the palace and indulged him in sensual pleasures.<\/p>\n<p>As fate had it, one day the prince went out of his palace and he saw a sick person, an old person, a corpse, and a monk. Siddharta realized that he, too, would become old, sick, and die. Later, he renounced his mundane life and embarked on his search for true happiness. After learning from several spiritual teachers, and practicing severe ascetism for six years, he finally meditated under a bodhi tree. Here he attained enlightenment. Because of his compassion for fellow humans, he revealed the path to achieve unconditional happiness.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5>The Jataka Tales<\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>Jataka tales<\/strong> are about the 500 Bodhisattvas, the alternating human and animal forms in which Buddha was reincarnated before he was born as Prince Siddhartha and attained enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Animals perform self-sacrifices for other beings<\/strong>. \u201cA sad monkey hugging a buffalo\u2019s neck is the\u00a0story of real friendship. One day a monkey had a problem. An ogre wanted to eat him. Devastated,\u00a0the monkey told his buffalo friend about his fate. The buffalo comforted the monkey, saying that he\u00a0would offer himself instead. What\u2019s more, the buffalo\u2019s body was bigger. The buffalo just asked themonkey to send his best wishes to his relatives. Then they both met the ogre. Touched by thekindness of the buffalo, the ogre dismissed his plan to eat either of them.\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avadana (Noble Deeds)<\/strong> are similar to Jataka, but the main figures are legendary people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Sudhana\u2019s quest for enlightenment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He was an Indian youth, maybe a merchant\u2019s son seeking bodhi (enlightenment).

There is little decoration, but lining the terraces are <strong>72 bell-shaped stupas, many containing a statue of the Buddha, partly visible through the lattice stonework<\/strong>.

A mandala is a symbolic picture of the universe painted on a wall or scroll, or simply created with colored sands on a table. It represents an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation. Each object in the palace has significance, representing an aspect of wisdom or reminding the meditator of a guiding principle.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>mandala&#8217;s purpose is to help transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones<\/strong> and to <strong>assist with healing. <\/strong>\u00a0The entire sacred manmade mountain of chiseled gray andesite is a giant stupa. On the topmost terrace, the main stupa contained an unfinished image of Buddha with the hands not fully carved that was hidden from the spectator\u2019s view, symbolized the indefinable ultimate spiritual state.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Techniques<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Progressively the reliefs on the terraces become more static. The sensuous roundness of the forms of the figures is not abated but, in the design, great emphasis is laid upon horizontals and verticals and upon static, formal enclosures of repeated figures and gestures. At the summit all movement disappears.<\/p>\n<p>The circular design enclosing the stupa, between the reliefs are decorative scroll panels, and a hundred monster-head waterspouts carrying off the tropical rainwater.<\/p>\n<p>The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Javanese Variation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Although the origin of the temple is based on Indian mythology and Buddhist iconography, one can see the Javanese influence. The statues are less refined and have been recreated in the local perception of beauty. This is the way Buddhism was manifested in Java during the Sailendra dynasty.<\/p>\n<p>Based on Indian influences and Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, arriving via China during Tang dynasty (618-906), this became the Buddhism of Java.<\/p>\n<p>Sailendra dynasty shared their power with the Hindu dynasty Sanjaya. For example, the construction of the Kalasan temple \u2013 illustrates, that, apart from its religious function, the <strong>Borobudur<\/strong> also formed an important expression of power.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2107 \" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=717%2C473&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Buddha \u00a9 Dallas and John Heaton\/Free Agents 1 Limited\/Corbis\" width=\"717\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/198.-Buddha.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/198.-Buddha.jpg?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The congregational worship in<strong> Borobudur<\/strong> is performed in a walking pilgrimage paying reverence to the stupa.

The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vesak, the \u201cBuddha Day\u201d ceremony, occurs once a year during a full moon<\/strong>.

In the late fifth century, the Udyana legend was linked with the story of the dream of Emperor Ming (58-76 CE) of the Han dynasty in the official tale of how Buddhism was introduced to China.<\/p>\n<p>The new story claimed that the Buddha\u2019s painting that the emperor received was in fact the same first image produced by King Udyana in the Buddha\u2019s lifetime, thus giving authority to Chinese icons of the Buddha.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Udyana legend<\/strong> became embellished over time with details relating how one or many artisans were miraculously transported to the heavens to create the likeness of the living Buddha. Even today, there is an icon named the Udyana Shaka in Kyoto that is believed to be a direct copy of the legendary Udyana image that was brought from China to Japan by the monk Chonen in 985.<\/p>\n<p>Seiryoji\u2019s Shaka icon was always believed to embody miraculous powers that could be transferred to a replica if the copy was done with appropriate accuracy. The Udy\u0101na story does not only establish the tradition of a first image in the likeness of the Enlightened One, but also makes a claim for the anthropomorphic Buddha image to be a divine image that is religiously efficacious, even to the point that it is equal to the extraordinary salvific powers of the Buddha\u2019s relics.<\/p>\n<p>The salvific efficacy of a divine image is affirmed by its ability to work miracles, which, once it happens, turns out to be not at all surprising, but rather expected and matter of fact. Furthermore, the type of miracles produced by images is foreseeable and consists primarily of various appearances of light and the self-induced movement of the image.<\/p>\n<p>Stories about miraculous images were recorded in various text sources compiled during the sixth and seventh centuries. Within these miracle stories, a group of marvelous icons termed A\u015boka images can be identified.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, King Ashoka (reigned ca. 273-232 BCE) of the Maurya Dynasty left his famous stone edicts to testify to his widespread propagation of Buddhism, <strong>but at his time still no anthropomorphic Buddha images were known<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In China, his legend of having constructed 84, 000 relic stupas all over the world extended to sacred images. Even though stories of Ashoka images had become popular in the south of China, the notion of images possessing miraculous powers probably first arrived in the northern parts of China in the fifth century.<\/p>\n<p>These Ashoka images are characterized not only by their wonder-working abilities, but also by their miraculous origin that is usually narrated in stories about wondrous discoveries.<\/p>\n<p>One typical story about such images is a mural on the west side of the south wall in cave 323 at Dunhuang. Texts in accompanying cartouches state that two large Buddha statues on lotus pedestals came floating on the river Wu. Only the monks and believers in the Buddhist Law the wind and waves calmed down, and the statues could be taken to the monastery where they are worshipped until this very day<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Annex: The Great Monkey King (Jat 407)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>One day in Jetavana Monastery, Bhikkhus began talking about the good that the Buddha did for his relatives. When the Buddha asked them about their subject, and they told him, he said, &#8220;Bhikkhus, this is not the first time the Tathagata has done good works to benefit relatives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Then he told this story of the past.<\/p>\n<p>Long, long ago, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the Bodhisatta was born as a monkey in the Himalayas. When he was fully grown, he was extremely strong and vigorous and became the leader of a troop of eighty thousand monkeys.<\/p>\n<p>On the bank of the Ganges there was an enormous mango tree, with two massive branches so thick with leaves it looked like a mountain. Its sweet fruit was of exquisite fragrance and flavor. One branch spread over the bank of the river, but the other extended over the water.<\/p>\n<p>One day, while the monkey king was eating the succulent fruit, he thought, &#8220;If any of this fruit ever fell into the river, great danger could come to us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To prevent this, he ordered the monkeys to pick all the mango flowers or tiny fruit from that branch. One fruit, however, was hidden by an ant&#8217;s nest and escaped the monkeys&#8217; attention. When it ripened, it fell into the river.<\/p>\n<p>At that time, the King of Baranasi was bathing and amusing himself in the river. Whenever the king bathed in the river, he had nets stretched both upstream and downstream from where he was. The mango floated down the river and stuck in the net upstream from the king.<\/p>\n<p>That evening, as the king was leaving, the fishermen pulled in the net and found the fruit. As they had never seen a fruit like this before, they showed it to the king.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What is this fruit?&#8221; the king asked.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not know, sire,&#8221; they answered.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Who will know?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The foresters, sire.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The king summoned the foresters, who told him that the fruit was a mango. The king cut it with a knife and, after having the foresters eat some, tasted it himself. He also gave some of the fruit to the ministers and to his wives.<\/p>\n<p>The king could not forget the magnificent flavor of the ripe mango. Obsessed with desire for the new fruit, he called the foresters again and asked where the tree stood. When he learned that it was on the bank of the river, he had many rafts joined together and sailed upstream to find it. In due course, the king and his retinue arrived at the site of the huge tree.<\/p>\n<p>The king went ashore and set up a camp. After having eaten some of the delectable mangoes, he retired for the night on a bed prepared at the foot of the tree. Fires were lit and guards set on each side.<\/p>\n<p>At midnight, after the men had fallen asleep and all was quiet, the monkey king came with his troop.<\/p>\n<p>The eighty thousand monkeys moved from branch to branch eating mangoes. The noise woke the king, who roused his archers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Surround those monkeys eating mangoes and shoot them,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Tomorrow we will dine on mango fruit and monkey&#8217;s flesh.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The archers readied their bows to obey the king. The monkeys saw the archers and realized that all means of escape had been cut off. Shivering in fear of death, they ran to their leader and cried, &#8220;Sire, there are men with bows all around the tree preparing to shoot us. What can we do?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Do not fear,&#8221; he comforted them. &#8220;I will save your lives.&#8221; Then he climbed onto the branch stretching over the river. Springing from the end of it, he jumped a hundred bow-lengths and landed on the opposite bank of the Ganges.<\/p>\n<p>Judging the distance, he had jumped, he thought, &#8220;That is how far I came.&#8221; Then he found a long vine and cut it, thinking, &#8220;This much will be fastened to a tree, and this much will go across the river.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He secured one end of the vine to a sturdy tree and the other around his own waist. Then he again leapt across the river with the speed of a cloud blown by the wind. In his calculation, however, he had forgotten to include the length to be tied around his own waist, so he could not reach the trunk of the mango tree.<\/p>\n<p>He reached out and grabbed the end of a branch firmly with both hands. He signaled to the troop of monkeys and cried, &#8220;Quick! Step on my back and run along this vine to safety. Good luck to you all!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The eighty thousand monkeys, each in turn, respectfully saluted the monkey king, asked his pardon, and escaped in this way. The last monkey in the troop, however, had long resented the leader and wished to overthrow him. When he saw the monkey king hanging there, he exulted, &#8220;This is my chance to see the last of my enemy!&#8221; Climbing onto a high branch, he flung himself down on the monkey king&#8217;s back with a dreadful blow that broke his heart.<\/p>\n<p>After he caused his rival excruciating pain, the wicked monkey triumphantly escaped and left the monkey king to suffer alone.<\/p>\n<p>Having seen all that had happened as he lay on his bed, the king thought, &#8220;This noble monkey king, not caring for his own life, has ensured the safety of his troop. It would be wrong to destroy such an animal. I will have him brought down and taken care of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He ordered his men to lower the monkey gently down to a raft on the Ganges. After the monkey had been brought ashore and washed, the king anointed him with the purest oil. Spreading an oiled skin on his own bed and laying the monkey king on it, the king covered him with a yellow robe.<\/p>\n<p>After the noble animal had been given sugared water to drink, the king himself took a low seat and addressed him. &#8220;Noble monkey, you made yourself a bridge for all the other monkeys to pass over to safety. What are you to them, and what are they to you?&#8221; he asked.<\/p>\n<p>The monkey explained, &#8220;Great king, I guard the herd. I am their lord and chief. When they were filled with fear of your archers, I leapt a great distance to save them. After I had tied a vine around my waist, I returned to this mango tree. My strength was almost gone, but I managed to hold the branch so that my monkeys could pass over my back and reach safety. Because I could save them, I have no fear of death. Like a righteous king, I could guarantee the happiness of those over whom I used to reign. Sire, understand this truth! If you wish to be a righteous ruler, the happiness of your kingdom, your cities, and your people must be dear to you. It must be dearer than life itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After teaching the king in this way, the monkey king died. The king gave orders that the monkey king should be given a royal funeral. He ordered his wives to carry torches to the cemetery with their hair disheveled. The ministers sent a hundred wagon loads of wood for the funeral pyre. When the regal ceremony was over, the ministers took the skull to the king.<\/p>\n<p>The king built a shrine at the monkey&#8217;s burial place and made offerings of incense and flowers. He had the skull inlaid with gold, raised on a spear, and carried in front of the procession returning to Baranasi. There he put it at the royal gate and paid homage to it with incense and flowers. The whole city was decorated, and the skull was honored for seven days.<\/p>\n<p>For the rest of his life the king revered the skull as a relic, offering incense and garlands. Established in the wonderful teaching of the monkey king, he gave alms and performed other good deeds. He ruled his kingdom righteously and became destined for heaven.<\/p>\n<p>After the lesson, the Buddha declared the Truths and identified the Birth: &#8220;At that time the king was Ananda, the monkey retinue was this assembly, the wicked monkey was Devadatta, and I myself was the monkey king.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Art of South &amp; Southeast Asia Theme: \u201cHinduism and Buddhism\u201d Hinduism and Buddhism are the religions that dramatically affected the &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/art-of-south-southeast-asia\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Art of South &#038; Southeast Asia<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[10,26],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2076"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2076"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2076\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2572,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2076\/revisions\/2572"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2076"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2076"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2076"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
