This allows the artist to draw oil paint.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Horn Players<\/em><\/strong> is a<strong> triptych<\/strong> with a flat, dark background color uniting all three panels. Each canvas has flat patches of color and dense thick lines.<\/p>\n<p>This <strong>Neo-Expressionism<\/strong> work retains rough handling, jagged forms and jarring color, but now has a focus on the body. Pride of place has made an exit as the important figures are off to the sides. Large sections of white paint seem to obscure what was underneath.<\/p>\n<p>There is no sense of scale or balance. The artist relies heavily on juxtaposition and contrast to make the painting dynamic and expressive. The traditional approach to 3D space is gone.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is the Function of <em>Horn Players<\/em>?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work connects <strong>graffiti with jazz and fine art. <\/strong>Through this it elevates the practice of graffiti itself to a fine art. It also connects <strong>jazz to African American culture<\/strong> thereby honoring African American history and contributions.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Horn Players<\/em><\/strong> was inspired by the scatting and improvisational work performed in jazz. <strong><em>Horn Players<\/em><\/strong> replicates that technique here.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Up Close\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>On the <strong>left panel<\/strong> Charlie Parker (saxophonist) plays his instrument and emits hot pink notes and sounds.

Basquiat was one of the leaders.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Jean-Michel Basquiat\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Basquiat<\/strong> was a homeless NYC queer man of color. He was a <strong>graffiti artist, sex worker and poet<\/strong>. Discovered in 1981 at age 20, he becomes dazzlingly successful at quick speed.<\/p>\n<p>He was known for his tag SAMO (Same Old Shit) written in marker and spray paint on subway trains, sidewalks, and gallery walls. This attracted the attention of gallery owners and the art world.<\/p>\n<p>Based on his success, critics referred to him as the \u201cblack Picasso\u201d. While this likened him to Picasso, Basquiat felt conflicted about this term, because the word black was added.<\/p>\n<p>He once said, \u201cIf you wanna talk about influence, man, then you\u2019ve got to realize that influence is not influence. It\u2019s simply someone\u2019s idea going through my new mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some of his paintings have sold for $20 million.

It is meant to appear rough and course. This is an abstracted, simplified, dramatically reduced figure that is hollow with no head, forearms, or shins. A mold process was used to make the form out of burlap, with resin to stiffen it.<\/p>\n<p>This\u00a0 is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round<\/strong> and can also be viewed from the back.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why is this Neo-Expressionism? <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work is a return to the body and the expressive capabilities of the bodies. This was believed to have been lost in Pop Art and Site-Specific Art. It is <strong>a rejection of the modernist attitude that the body is dead<\/strong>. Additionally, the style is a revival of Expressionism, with rough, jagged handling, and sharp forms.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work examines the <strong>relationship between individual and community<\/strong> (isolation and loss). It notes <strong>dehumanization and lack of identity<\/strong> are the result of strife, war, anguish and derision.<\/p>\n<p>It <strong>depicts isolation and loss<\/strong> in a universal way. We cannot identify this figure specifically. So much of this figure has been lost, destroyed and hurt. Our own identities become lost and are vulnerable in our modern, violent worlds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We identify and recognize this figure<\/strong> even though we see SO little of it. Destruction leaves us as shells of who we once were.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This <strong>androgynous figure<\/strong> focuses on humanity, rather than gender. Notice\u00a0 the body language. The shoulders are pulled forward, with a slumping back.<\/p>\n<p>The figure in deep despair:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>wrinkled skin<\/li>\n<li>backbone<\/li>\n<li>musculature<\/li>\n<li>veins<\/li>\n<li>missing limbs and head<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is elevated from the floor by a wood structure as a base.

Gurney?<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz <\/strong>was considered <strong>a pioneer of fiber-based sculpture. <\/strong>Her art was affected by her experiences in Poland, under Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II.<\/p>\n<p>Born in 1930, she lived on a large estate in Poland. Here she often played in the woods. She said this later inspired her to use natural materials in her works.<\/p>\n<p>In WWII, German tanks entered her family\u2019s estate. Later a drunk German soldier burst into the house and shot off her mother\u2019s arm in front of her. In 1944, the family fled, as the Soviet army arrived and moved into Warsaw.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Abakanowicz<\/strong> worked as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded. This would later affect her art.<\/p>\n<p>When the war was over, she attended art school at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Warsaw. Poland was a part of the Soviet Bloc. Social Realism was the style taught in art schools with smiling workers and images of a perfect society. She tried to avoid learning this style by choosing to work with textiles. Yet, \u00a0she had to adopt it to obtain a degree and enter the Polish Artist Union.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(10) 232. <em>Dancing at the Louvre, <\/em>from the series <em>The French Collection, Part I; #1<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Faith Ringgold.

The artwork measures 6 feet 3 inches by 6 feet and 9 inches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Faith Ringgold<\/strong> calls this work a <strong>story-quilt<\/strong>. She creates <strong>a central image using acrylic paint on canvas<\/strong>, then surrounds it with a patchwork cloth border that includes her <strong>handwritten text<\/strong>. In this way, she <strong>utilizes text and image together<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Next, she sandwiches a layer of batting underneath the canvas and on top of another piece of cloth. The figures are simple, flat, and stiff with a space that is shallow.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Through her art, she can rewrite the past through weaving together the history of African Americans and women. This is an alternative to the white masculine narratives that are prevalent in art history. This highlights the ways in which African-Americans and their experiences have been left out. Through most of history they have not been the subjects or the intended audiences of Western painting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ringgold\u2019s<\/strong> technique challenges the definition of painting and <strong>fine art<\/strong>. She has used acrylic on canvas but has mixed in the prominent <strong>folk art<\/strong>\/craft tradition of quilting. Folk art is often defined in part by being produced by untrained artists.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is the first in Ringgold\u2019s series of twelve \u201cstory quilts\u201d called <strong><em>The French Collection. <\/em><\/strong>The story\u00a0tells the fictional narrative of Willa Marie Simone, a young black woman who moves to Paris in the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>Willa Marie\u2019s adventures in Paris in the 1920s lead her to meet celebrities: Picasso, Matisse, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Josephine Baker.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>three paintings<\/strong> that the work shows as a backdrop at the Louvre are <strong>all by DaVinci<\/strong>: <em>Madonna and Child and St. Anne; Mona Lisa; Virgin of the Rocks<\/em>. Note all of the paintings are of woman and girls.<\/p>\n<p>The girls dancing in front of the art become the show \u2013 instead of the historical white version on the walls!<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Text on this image<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em>Marcia and her three little girls took me dancing at the Louvre. I thought I was taking them to see the Mona Lisa, but you\u2019ve never seen anything like this. Well, the French hadn\u2019t either. Nevermind Leonardo da Vinci and Mona Lisa, Marcia and her three girls were the show<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art Expansion\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work is an expansion of the art world and the art object. <strong>Faith Ringgold<\/strong> is African American woman, and the art object is now a folk art\/fine art hybrid. This reflects shifts into post-Modernism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Post-Modernism<\/strong> rejects Modernism\u2019s emphasis on universal meaning and abstraction.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why the Story Quilts were Made\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ringgold\u2019s story-quilting technique is important. <strong>Her mother was a fashion designer and seamstress<\/strong>. When her mother died in 1981, Ringgold started making these quilts.<\/p>\n<p>Quilts have been associated with <strong>women\u2019s domestic work<\/strong> and <strong>women\u2019s connections with one another. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Quilting is often done collectively. Young girls watch and participate to learn family stories, cultural backgrounds, and technical skills.<\/p>\n<p>Quilts were of particular importance to the history of African Americans. On the Underground Railroad, codes and hidden messages were sewn onto quilts in safe houses that could help slaves find more secret routes and safe houses to the North.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(10) 238. <em>Electronic Superhighway<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Nam June Paik.
