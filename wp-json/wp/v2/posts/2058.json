Asian arts and architecture reveal exchanges of knowledge in visual style, form, and technology with traditions farther west.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>GrecoRoman Connections<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Early connections with the <strong>GrecoRoman<\/strong> world are evident in the Hellenistic-influenced artistic style and subjects found in artwork associated with ancient Gandharan culture in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Early Buddha sculptures in north India, China, and Japan wear a two-shouldered robe based on the Roman toga.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Islamic Influence<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>South and Southeast Asia had early <strong>contact with Islam<\/strong> through trade. In western India, contact was achieved through military campaigns. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Islamic sultanates arose in these lands, creating another layer of cultural practices and interactions. This influenced Asian visual culture through the importation and creation of new art forms and styles.<\/p>\n<p>Innovations based on Islamic influence in these areas include the use of paper for manuscripts and paintings. It also includes the adoption of Mughal styles in Hindu court architecture, painting, and fashion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>European Adaptations<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>European influence<\/strong> is evident in the evolution of architectural styles, and in the adoption of naturalism and perspective in Asian painting traditions during the colonial era.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sharing with West Asia and Europe<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Asian art forms had great influence on the arts of West Asia and Europe. Art and ideas were exchanged through trade routes. The impact of Asian art is especially evident during times of free exchange. Import time frames include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Silk Route during the Han and Tang dynasties and Mongol Empire.<\/li>\n<li>The colonial era.<\/li>\n<li>The opening of Japan for trade in the 19th century.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>A Market for Collectors<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In West Asia and Europe, collectors acquired Asian art works through gift or trade. Ceramics created in China, from Tang slipwares to highfire porcelains, have been coveted internationally for more than 1,000 years. The popularity of <strong>Chinese blue-and-white porcelain<\/strong> was so high that ceramic centers in Iran, Turkey, and across Europe developed local versions of blue-and-white ceramics to meet market demand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Textiles<\/strong> are also an important Asian art form. So coveted these fabrics dominated much of the international trade between Europe and Asia. <strong>Silk and silk weaving<\/strong> originated in <strong>China<\/strong>, where it flourished for thousands of years. <strong>Cotton<\/strong> was first spun and woven in the Indus Valley region of <strong>Pakistan<\/strong> and was, like silk, important for international trade.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Comparisons in Cultures<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Cross-cultural comparisons may be made most readily among the arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia and the arts of the ancient Mediterranean, medieval Europe, and West Asia.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 207.
