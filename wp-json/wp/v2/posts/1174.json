African arts are active. They motivate behavior, contain and express belief, and validate social organization and human relations.<\/p>\n<p>Use and efficacy are central to the art of Africa. African arts, though often characterized, collected, and exhibited as figural sculptures and masks, are by nature meant to be performed rather than simply viewed.<\/p>\n<p>African arts are often described in terms of the contexts and functions with which they appear to be associated.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Daily Use and Ritual Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art is created for both <strong>daily use<\/strong> and <strong>ritual purposes<\/strong> such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leadership<\/li>\n<li>Religious beliefs<\/li>\n<li>Diagnosis and divination<\/li>\n<li>Education<\/li>\n<li>Personal adornment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Creative Purpose<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art forms may be prescribed by a diviner, commissioned by a supplicant, and produced by a specific artist. The art object comes under the custodianship of the person who commissioned it or a member of his or her family.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Performances of objects<\/strong> are accompanied by costumes and music. None of these practices is simple or random. Cultural protocols acknowledge and ensure the efficacy and appropriateness of artistic experience in Africa.<\/p>\n<p>The arts of <strong>authority<\/strong>, both achieved, and inherited status and roles legitimate <strong>traditional leadership<\/strong>. Leaders\u2019 histories and accomplishments are often entrusted to and lauded by historians, bards, and elders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personal identity<\/strong>, <strong>social status<\/strong>, and <strong>relationships<\/strong> are delineated by aesthetic choices and artistic expression. Common ancestors link leaders, sanction social behavior and choices, and define the order of social life.<\/p>\n<p>Education, incorporation into adulthood, and civic responsibility are processes marked by the creation, manipulation, and interpretation of art objects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>African histories<\/strong>, often sung or recited, are traditionally the responsibility of specialists. African art is sung, danced, and presented in holistic experiences for designated audiences; it is created for specific reasons and to produce expected results.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(6) 174.

The mask is worn over the top of the head and the raffia is meant to fall over the face. Men were responsible for making these masks. When a girl became initiated, the village\u2019s master woodcarver created a special mask just for her. The carving was dependent on a dream the carver would have about the occasion.<\/p>\n<p>When the mask was not in use, it remained hidden.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How the Mask was Used<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>mask was worn by a woman<\/strong> and the <strong>ceremony was for a woman<\/strong>.\u00a0 Each mask was unique to the girl, and this is the only masquerade performance known where women wore the masks.

It must disguise the entire body so that a vengeful spirit does not take her. The mask sits on top of the head.\u00a0 It represents ideal female spirits and qualities. Shaped like the chrysalis of a butterfly, the mask symbolized a young woman entering puberty.\u00a0 When young girls are in seclusion, they are referred to as chrysalis.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Mask in Detail <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>eyes<\/strong> are downcast and suggests reserve and humility. There are small eye slits to look out of. The <strong>mouth<\/strong> is small indicating she does not gossip. The <strong>ears<\/strong> are small too indicating she does not listen to idle gossip. The <strong>forehead <\/strong>is high to illustrate a sharp mind. <strong>Hair<\/strong> indicates health and purity, while the <strong>intricate hairstyle<\/strong> represents a close tie with the women in the community.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>rings around the neck<\/strong> have some significance. The prominent rolls at the back of the neck shows that the figure has enough body fat to give birth to healthy children. These rings could also symbolize concentric waves from which the Sowei breaks through the surface.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>color<\/strong> black symbolized water, coolness, humanity, mystery.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>In Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Mende People are an ethnic group of mostly agriculturalists. They are divided into two groups of those who have been initiated and those who haven\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Initiation rites<\/strong> for girls in the Sande Society involved being removed from their everyday lives and taken to a secluded place in the forest. The act of going to the jungle symbolized secrecy and fertility. Seclusion could last several weeks to several months<\/p>\n<p>While in the forest, girls were anointed with white clay and animal fat to make themselves dry, pasty, unattractive. Girls were taught how to be good wives and good mothers. They were instructed in domestic skills, sex, farming, dancing, medicine by the women of the Sande Society.<\/p>\n<p>While secluded, <strong>the main ritual girls<\/strong> underwent is <strong>female genital mutilation <\/strong>were the labia and clitoris were removed. This was supposed to increase fertility. It was also thought to instill proper sexual behavior which was considered that sex should not be pleasurable for the woman, rather it was a duty. It was thought to make a young woman clean, test her strength and foreshadow the pain of childbirth. It was also considered a bondage experience between the girls, who had all gone through the same pain and healing process.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the ceremony, their white clay is ritually washed off their body. The young women emerge with a new name and new clothing.<\/p>\n<p>The community has been reluctant to share details of ceremony with scholars, particularly Western scholars.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(6) 177. <\/strong><em><strong>Lukasa<\/strong><\/em><strong> (memory board). <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Mbudye Society of the Luba peoples from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 19<sup>th<\/sup> to 20<sup>th<\/sup> century.
