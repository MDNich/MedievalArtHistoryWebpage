Two major methods for international trade connected Asia. One was <strong>the Silk Route<\/strong> that linked Europe and Asia, connecting the Indian subcontinent to overland trade routes through Central Asia, terminating in X\u2019ian, China. The second was the vast <strong>maritime networks<\/strong> that utilized seasonal monsoon winds to move trade among North Africa, West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and south China. These routes were the vital mechanism for the transmission of cultural ideas and practices, such as Buddhism, and of artistic forms, media, and styles across mainland and maritime Asia.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Religion and Culture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Buddhism<\/strong> was actively imported to Japan from Korea and China in the 7th and 8th centuries. It succeeded first in China, and then other countries, because of courtly patronage and similarities with local traditions.<\/p>\n<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia were also home to <strong>foreign cultures and religions<\/strong>, including <strong>GrecoRoman<\/strong> cultures, <strong>Christianity<\/strong>, and most notably <strong>Islamic <\/strong>cultures from West and Central Asia. Islamic influence is particularly strong in India, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which were under at least partial control of Islamic sultanates during the second millennia CE. These regions have also been influenced by cultures and beliefs from West Asia and Europe. Today South and Southeast Asia are home to the world\u2019s largest <strong>Muslim\u00a0<\/strong>populations.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 195.

In the nativity scene, Queen Maya&#8217;s depiction recalls the tree spirits or yakshinis. These spirits are are often shown as beautiful and voluptuous, with a flywhisk in right hand, fleshy cheeks, wide hips, narrow waists, broad shoulders, knotted hair and exaggerated, spherical breasts. According to legend, the infant stood and took seven steps. With each step, a lotus flower appeared, to prevent his tiny feet from touching the ground.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Here is the Story<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Siddharta was born to King Sudhodana and Queen Maya of the Sakya clan who reigned in Kosala, India, around the fifth century BC. One day Queen Maya had a dream of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was interpreted by priests as a sign that the couple would bear a son, who would become either a world ruler or a Buddha. The king preferred him to be the world ruler, so he confined the prince in the palace and indulged him in sensual pleasures.<\/p>\n<p>As fate had it, one day the prince went out of his palace and he saw a sick person, an old person, a corpse, and a monk. Siddharta realized that he, too, would become old, sick, and die. Later, he renounced his mundane life and embarked on his search for true happiness. After learning from several spiritual teachers, and practicing severe ascetism for six years, he finally meditated under a bodhi tree. Here he attained enlightenment. Because of his compassion for fellow humans, he revealed the path to achieve unconditional happiness.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Jataka tales<\/strong> are about the 500 Bodhisattvas, the alternating human and animal forms in which Buddha was reincarnated before he was born as Prince Siddhartha and attained enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Animals perform self-sacrifices for other beings<\/strong>. \u201cA sad monkey hugging a buffalo\u2019s neck is the story of real friendship. One day a monkey had a problem. An ogre wanted to eat him. Devastated,\u00a0the monkey told his buffalo friend about his fate. The buffalo comforted the monkey, saying that he\u00a0would offer himself instead. What\u2019s more, the buffalo\u2019s body was bigger. The buffalo just asked themonkey to send his best wishes to his relatives. Then they both met the ogre. Touched by thekindness of the buffalo, the ogre dismissed his plan to eat either of them.\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avadana (Noble Deeds)<\/strong> are similar to Jataka, but the main figures are legendary people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Sudhana\u2019s quest for enlightenment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He was an Indian youth, maybe a merchant\u2019s son seeking bodhi (enlightenment). He takes a pilgrimage on his quest for enlightenment and studies under 52 \u201cteachers\u201d: a doctor teaches him compassion for the ill, children playing teach him about simple happiness,\u2026<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Detachment from the Physical World<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The upper level illustrates \u201cthe realm of formlessness,\u201d or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration, but lining the terraces are <strong>72 bell-shaped stupas, many containing a statue of the Buddha, partly visible through the lattice stonework<\/strong>. The <strong>504 Buddha statues are shaped to express 6 different mudras<\/strong> (hand positions).<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Buddha Hand Gestures and Significance<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right hand across right knee symbolizing the summons of the Earth Goddess.<\/li>\n<li>Right hand open with the face of the hand facing upwards \u2013 a symbolic gesture of loving kindness by the act of giving.<\/li>\n<li>Both hands folded on his lap symbolic for meditation.<\/li>\n<li>Right hand raised upwards with the face of the hand facing the audience \u2013 a symbolic gesture of dispelling of fear.<\/li>\n<li>Right hand slightly lifted upwards with the tips of his thumb and index finger touching each other \u2013 a symbolic gesture of preaching the Dharma.<\/li>\n<li>Both hands raised in front of the center of the upper body, touching with his right ring finger his left index finger \u2013 by far the most important symbolic gesture, for it represents the turning of the wheel of the Dharma.<\/li>\n<li>The archways allow people to access the higher levels are decorated with pre-Buddhist elements, \u00a0such as the fearsome face and open mouth of Kala. This is a Hindu deity from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, In Javanese mythology, Batara. Kala is the god of destruction.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5><strong>Symbolism of the Mandala<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The temple\u2019s plan suggests a <strong>mandala<\/strong>, one of the richest visual objects in Buddhism. A mandala is a symbolic picture of the universe painted on a wall or scroll, or simply created with colored sands on a table. It represents an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation. Each object in the palace has significance, representing an aspect of wisdom or reminding the meditator of a guiding principle.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>mandala&#8217;s purpose is to help transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones<\/strong> and to <strong>assist with healing. <\/strong>\u00a0The entire sacred manmade mountain of chiseled gray andesite is a giant stupa. On the topmost terrace, the main stupa contained an unfinished image of Buddha with the hands not fully carved that was hidden from the spectator\u2019s view, symbolized the indefinable ultimate spiritual state.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Techniques<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Progressively the reliefs on the terraces become more static. The sensuous roundness of the forms of the figures is not abated but, in the design, great emphasis is laid upon horizontals and verticals and upon static, formal enclosures of repeated figures and gestures. At the summit all movement disappears.<\/p>\n<p>The circular design enclosing the stupa, between the reliefs are decorative scroll panels, and a hundred monster-head waterspouts carrying off the tropical rainwater.<\/p>\n<p>The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Javanese Variation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Although the origin of the temple is based on Indian mythology and Buddhist iconography, one can see the Javanese influence. The statues are less refined and have been recreated in the local perception of beauty. This is the way Buddhism was manifested in Java during the Sailendra dynasty.<\/p>\n<p>Based on Indian influences and Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, arriving via China during Tang dynasty (618-906), this became the Buddhism of Java.<\/p>\n<p>Sailendra dynasty shared their power with the Hindu dynasty Sanjaya. For example, the construction of the Kalasan temple \u2013 illustrates, that, apart from its religious function, the Borobudur also formed an important expression of power.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The congregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage paying reverence to the stupa. This is achieved by circumambulating and keeping it on the right. The visitor is transformed and educated, while climbing through the levels of Borobudur. The encountering of illustrations of progressively more profound tales from Jataka and Avadana is achieved in a \u00a0similar way to the very early frescoes of the Ajanta Caves in India.<\/p>\n<p>Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment.

It was <strong>built for the patron King Suryavarman<\/strong> II (1113\u20131145\/50 C.E.) and dedicated to the Hindu god <strong>Vishnu<\/strong>, one of the three principal gods in the Hindu pantheon, along with <strong>Shiva and Brahma<\/strong>. Vishnu is known as the protector.<\/p>\n<p>It is believed that <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong> was also to house the king after death and used as a mausoleum.<\/p>\n<p>The name <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong> comes from the Khmer language, the official language of Cambodia. It means City Temple.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Siem Reap<\/strong> was once the capital of the Khmer empire, <strong>then known as Angko<\/strong>r. From the 800s to the 1300s it was a prosperous hydraulic facility that collected monsoon waters from the rainy season, in huge basins. This elevated flooding, and protected plantations during drought.<\/p>\n<p>Merchants and traders of gold and spices brought Hinduism and later Buddhism. Business opportunities caused people to stay in the region<\/p>\n<p>Since Angkor itself was the technical source of the life-giving agricultural water controlled by the king, it was regarded by the Khmer with religious reverence. Its temples and palaces were an expression of that and at the same time an essential part of its supernatural mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>Royal intercession by numerous ceremonies, some of which re-enacted the primal marriage of Hindu divinity and native earth spirit on the pattern of ancient folk cult, ensured the continuing gift of the waters of heaven.<\/p>\n<p>The king, an earthly image of his god, was the intermediary who ensured that his kingdom would continue to receive divine benevolence in the form of water in controlled quantities.<\/p>\n<p>Courtiers played roles both religious and administrative for the king, who believed that after his death he would be united with his patron deity. Dedicatory statues were often set up in his chief temple to commemorate his divinization.<\/p>\n<p>The Khmer kings were tied to the city, even as they changed religions. The city was transformed using both Hindi and Mahayana Buddhist architecture and artistic style layers beneath the surface of the temple.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2063\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2063\" style=\"width: 804px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2063\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/199.-B.jpg?resize=804%2C510&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/199.-B.jpg?w=323&amp;ssl=1 323w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/199.-B.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2063\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Gate of Angkor Thom \u00a9 Christophe Boisvieux\/Corbis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A large moat and a high wall surround Angkor Wat on all sides, which are longer than one kilometer.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the temple develops on three levels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a new enclosure, formed of galleries, pierced with monumental porches on all four sides and provided with corner towers<\/li>\n<li>a <strong>second floor<\/strong> repeating the same arrangement<\/li>\n<li>a <strong>central tower<\/strong> composed of five towers-sanctuaries staggered and interconnected by cruciform galleries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>temple mountain<\/strong> was a Southeast Asian invention in architecture.

The new city, Angkor Thom, was &#8211; like the previous ones &#8211; enclosed in a vast quadrilateral, each side of which was oriented in relation to a cardinal point. Four triumphal ways (north-south and east-west) cut it into quarters.<\/p>\n<p>The Buddhist cosmology inspired the symbolism and dispositions of the great foundations (Angkor Thom, Preah Khan, etc.).

The largest figure is that of <strong>King Jahangir<\/strong>, while the man in front of him is <strong>Sufi Sheikh Hussain<\/strong>, in a dimension little shorter than him. The king is adorned with jewelry as opposed to pale garb of the sheikh.<\/p>\n<p>King Jahangir is handing over a book to the Sufi Sheikh Hussain, which he accepts in a shawl, avoiding the physical contact, as an imperial protocol.<\/p>\n<p>The figure below the spiritual leader is an <strong>Ottoman sultan<\/strong>, followed by <strong>English King James I<\/strong>. Ottoman sultan&#8217;s turban-tied headdress distinguishes him as a foreigner to the Mughal court, while he awaits his chance to greet Jahangir. King James I, in his royal attire, gazes out of the painting, which is a typical style of European art.<\/p>\n<p>The last figure is that of <strong>the artist<\/strong> himself, <strong>Bichitra<\/strong>. Despite the significance over the form of the King\u2019s figure, the ochre-chrome yellow garb of Bichitra grabs the attention compulsively. However, the attire&#8217;s fashion indicates that he was a Hindu artist in the Mughal court. He is holding a miniature painting, which suggests his profession.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Adaptations of European Forms<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Apart from these, the other flying semi-human forms are <strong>putti figures<\/strong>, which are European-influenced characters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The halo<\/strong> behind the Jahangir\u2019s head, and <strong>hourglass<\/strong>, are further adaptations of European forms. Concentric in kind, glaring flames around the head seemingly recognize his sun-like illuminated and authoritative demeanor.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the crescent moon at the lower arc of the halo is a prevalent representation of spiritual enlightenment in Jain paintings. Symbolically, the crescent moon also narrates the endless cycle of day and night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>King Jahangir<\/strong> is seated on a large and ornate hourglass. On the putti on the hourglass are engraving with an inscription that reads, \u201cAllah is great. O Shah may the span of your reign be a thousand years\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The hourglass is an emblematic attribute of the beginning of the new Islamic millennium, it begins with the rule of a knowledgeable Mughal ruler.<\/p>\n<p>From these forms we can infer that Bichitra had been studying European artworks that were accepted by the king as gifts.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Realism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>While figures are naturalistic and convincingly real, space itself is tipped <strong>upwards and flattened<\/strong>. A few areas are painted in gradual tonal values, while the rest is in flat application of colors. Artist has utilized a <strong>colorful palette<\/strong> with incredibly precise and intricate detailing. Notably, the division of backdrop helps in acquiring a rhythmic gaze over the work.<\/p>\n<p>An ornate lower half, which apparently is a Persianate carpet, is replete with <strong>abstract, repetitive, and naturalistic design.<\/strong> In addition, the artist has neglected linear perspective to feature the content significantly.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Frames Within Frames<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The painting is enclosed in a <strong>group of rectangular frames<\/strong> that show a varying <strong>floral and calligraphic designs<\/strong>. Bordering with repetitive and small decorative cartouches, the background of the folio has floral arabesque. These <strong>floral motifs<\/strong> are inspired by the local flowers of the region.<\/p>\n<p>At the cusp of the painting, on the vertical edges, the band depicts a calligraphic verse praising the king. The lower band expresses, \u201cThough outwardly Shahs stand before him, he fixes his gaze on dervishes.\u201d<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Mughal miniatures<\/strong> were often a part of a more comprehensive book project called <strong>Muraqqa<\/strong>. Murraqas describes lives of Mughal kings or elites. They were accessible to the selected and not common men.<\/p>\n<p>After the volume was written, it would be given to an artist with secluded pages to illustrate the relevant narratives.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this folio was to render a spiritual and wise image of noble Mughal King Jahangir. As he preferred a spiritual Sufi Sheikh over the kings of the world, he is indicated to be a grand sovereign of the Indian subcontinent.<\/p>\n<p>Mughal paintings are said to have used <strong>gold, silver, and lapiz lazuli<\/strong>, among other hues, for rendition. The usage of material depended on the project and the role it played over the larger mass. The <strong>colors<\/strong> were generally obtained from <strong>local natural resources<\/strong>. For example, white was made by grinding the conch, while black from the lamp residue.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Mughal kings followed greater political propaganda to disperse the might of the Mughal ruler. It also displayed Jahangir\u2019s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety\u2019s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Traditions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance<\/strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.<\/p>\n<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him<\/strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp\u2019s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous\u00a0<em>Hamzanama<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hamzanama\u00a0<\/em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir\u2019s court painters<\/p>\n<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patrons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Bichitra<\/strong> (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to\u00a0<em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings<\/em>\u00a0under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases.\u00a0<em>Baburnama<\/em>,\u00a0<em>Akbarnama<\/em>,\u00a0<em>Tujuk-I- Jahangir<\/em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Establishing ateliers<\/strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.<\/strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved<\/strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette<\/strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts<\/strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.<\/p>\n<p>During Akbar\u2019s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Bichitra was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir\u2019s reign.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 209. Taj Mahal <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Mughal.

Considered as one of the seven man-made wonders of the world, the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is known as the <strong>Crown of the Palace<\/strong>. Originally, it was known as Rauza-i-munawwara, which means illuminated tomb.<\/p>\n<p>Projecting unique beauty, the mausoleum is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb. Comprising calligraphic decoration in precious gemstones, it is an exceptional Mughal structure in white marble. Many kinds of research on the yellowing of the marble have been conducted in light of global warming, resulting in strict restrictions over the surrounding vicinity.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is not a singular marvel, rather it is a large complex of twin mosques, exemplary gardens, and marvelous gates. In 1983, UNESCO designated the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> and the complex as World Heritage site.

Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces. <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is situated in the center of a large complex on 42 acres. \u00a0The complex consists of the main tomb flanked by twin mosques\u2014they are identical in size and rendition\u2014that face the tomb. It also consists of a guest house and beautiful gardens called Chahar bagh, which used the Persian style.<\/p>\n<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone<\/strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna River, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Taj Mahal is built on a square and raised platform<\/strong> or a plinth. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of eight paradises, rendering the plan octagonally. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber. The onion-shaped dome is flanked by four minarets at the four corners of the plinth. Mounted with a finial and a crescent moon, the dome is a golden spot of wonder. At the lower lever, four smaller-sized domes surrounding the central dome. Each smaller dome is comprised of a\u00a0<em>chhatri\u00a0<\/em>(kiosk), enclosing a balcony.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>arched gate to enter the tomb<\/strong> is called\u00a0<em><strong>iwan<\/strong><\/em>. It is framed by a rectangular and decorated surface called\u00a0<em>pishtaq<\/em>. The gates and other walls project <strong>chamfered corners<\/strong>, a peculiar style of Mughal architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Remarkably, the four minarets are tilted away from the central dome, as a precautionary act to avoid damage to the main structure, especially during an occurrence of a natural calamity. Minarets also have a\u00a0<em><strong>chhatri<\/strong><\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>and a staircase to reach the top. They are associated with the religious duty of calling for daily prayers. The\u00a0<em><strong>muezzin<\/strong><\/em>, the official assigned the announcing duty, calls the public for the\u00a0<em><strong>namaz<\/strong><\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>or prayer from these minarets.<\/p>\n<p>The central chamber places the two cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz. Shah Jahan died thirty years after his wife. Mumtaj died after giving birth to their 14th offspring in 1631. The real sarcophagi are safely stored at the lower level. The sarcophagi are ornate with calligraphy. The surface calligraphic verses from the Quran are inlaid in precious stones. The technique is known as Pietra dura, which uses cut and polished colored stones. The verses refer to the paradise and day of judgment, wherein God royally and dutifully rewards the faithful.<\/p>\n<p>The tomb shows many floral patterns, as animal or human figures are prohibited, due to Islam protocols. In addition, the\u00a0<em><strong>jali<\/strong><\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>or a mesh decorative and lapidary is frequently observed.<\/p>\n<p>Composed unconventionally, as opposed to other Mughal or Islamic tombs, the surface of the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is wondrously composed to derive an impeccable play of light and shadow.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is a mausoleum and it serves a funerary function. Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.<\/p>\n<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan. Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of compassion and royalty.<\/p>\n<p>As it is built on the raised platform, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural metaphor for Paradise. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is the symbol of unconditioned love. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the<strong> Taj Mahal<\/strong> has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaz by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.<\/p>\n<p>Significantly, the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> emphasizes the power vested in royal Mughal patrons. Shah Jahan decided to build it in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, bringing many Persian artists to India. The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of miniature paintings. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing and being influenced by indigenous Indian art. Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.<\/p>\n<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s<\/strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of <strong>Islamic and Indian architecture<\/strong>.\u00a0 Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule. Many motifs from Hindu culture had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style<\/strong>, some <strong>plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patrons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mughals were Islamic rulers in India \u2013 known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. It is mentioned that Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, which allowed for easy access to water, Agra was known as a \u201criverfront\u201d city.<\/p>\n<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad A\u1e25mad Lahawr\u012b, an Indian of Persian descent.<\/p>\n<p>The five principal elements of the complex, which includes the main gateway, garden, mosque, jaw\u0101b (literally \u201canswer\u201d, a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.<\/p>\n<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638\u201339. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> welcomes millions of worldwide tourists every year. After the Taj Mahal was listed a one of the seven man-made wonders of the world, its popularity has grown by leaps and bounds. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns. This has resulted in many new rules and regulations for visitors. Shah Jahan erected this wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection. This was a ground-breaking achievement. \u00a0It has continued to draw crowds to Agra to receive a glimpse of architectural beauty. Even after four hundred years Taj Mahal continues to inspire great awe.<\/p>\n<p>During this time in history, the Indian continent observed an influx of Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, conducting business with Indian counterparts. The presence of Europeans also appears in many Mughal paintings, proving their acceptance in Mughal courts. Shah Jahan was a promoter of arts and culture. This did not pass onto the next Mughal ruler and his son Aurangzeb. This led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving ground for the British to take charge by the 18th century.<\/p>\n<h5><em><strong>UP NEXT:<\/strong><\/em><\/h5>\n<p><strong>South, East and Southeast Asia\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>300 BCE-1980 CE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/south-east-and-southeast-asia-8-4\/\">TOPIC 8.4 Theories and Interpretations of South, East, and Southeast Asian Art<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>South, East and Southeast Asia\u00a0 300 BCE-1980 CE TOPIC 8.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in South, East, and Southeast &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/south-east-and-southeast-asia-8-3\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">South, East and Southeast Asia 8.3<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,10,26],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2050"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2050"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2050\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2803,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2050\/revisions\/2803"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2050"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2050"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2050"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
