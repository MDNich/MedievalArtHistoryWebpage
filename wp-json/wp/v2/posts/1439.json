The term \u201cIslamic art\u201d may be applied to these diverse art forms. Many examples of Islamic art from across the traditional Islamic lands share similarities in terms of their content and visual characteristics.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Pilgrimage <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Pilgrimage is an important religious practice in Islam and Buddhism and is a key focus of several monuments and artworks in West and Central Asia including the <strong>Kaaba, <\/strong>the most sacred site in Islam; the <strong>Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem<\/strong>; and the <strong>Buddha sculpture Jowo Rinpoche<\/strong>, considered the most sacred image in Tibet.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Patrons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The arts of West and Central Asia were created for and acquired by various kinds of local and global patrons. Audiences for these works included royal and wealthy patrons, lay and monastic religious practitioners, and foreign collectors who acquired works through gift or\u00a0trade.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Architecture in West and Central Asia is frequently religious in function. West and Central Asia is home to many important <strong>Islamic mosques<\/strong>, which are decorated with non figural imagery, including calligraphy and vegetal forms.<\/p>\n<p>All mosques have a Qibla wall, which faces the direction of Mecca, home of the Kaaba. This wall is ornamented with an empty <strong>mihrab<\/strong>, serving as a niche for prayer. A large congregational mosque may also include a <strong>minbar <\/strong>or pulpit for the imam, as well as a <strong>minaret<\/strong> and a central courtyard to call and accommodate practitioners for prayer.<\/p>\n<p>Other important forms of Islamic religious architecture include <strong>commemorative monuments<\/strong>, such as the Kaaba and the Dome of the Rock, and tomb architecture. Central Asia is further recognized for its outstanding <strong>Buddhist cave architecture<\/strong>, which incorporates relief carving, constructive sculpture, and wall painting. In the Tibetan lands, <strong>Buddhist architecture<\/strong> flourishes in the form of stupas and monastic architecture.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(7) 183. The Kaaba. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Islamic.

Part of her dowry was the <strong>Jowo Rinpoche<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>On her way to Tibet from China, her wagon got stuck in the mud. This was interpreted as the Jowo Rinpoche wanting to stay on that spot, so construction began on a temple. Every day when workers returned to the site, the construction they had done the previous day had been undone. This continued for 6 years!<\/p>\n<p>Finally, a divination revealed that an ancient demoness was sleeping in the earth under the exact spot where they were building the temple. Every night, she would push her arms and legs, while thrashing around, wrecking the construction on the temple. To stop this, <strong>the main<\/strong> <strong>Jokhang Temple<\/strong> was built on her heart to weigh her down and prove Buddhism\u2019s supremacy, and <strong>ten smaller temples<\/strong> were built around Jokhang Temple to hold down her arms and legs.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(7) 186.
