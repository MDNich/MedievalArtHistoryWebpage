The Empire spoke Greek and practiced Orthodox Christianity. Religion spread throughout Eastern Europe. Justinian proclaimed Christianity to be the only <em>lawful<\/em> religion.

It is <strong>formal<\/strong>, relating to religion and politics. Yet, classical naturalism has been left out of this work.<\/p>\n<p>The images have a serious nature. The space is gold to show they are of a higher realm. This makes it look <strong>flat <\/strong>and the view is <strong>frontal.<\/strong> The images appear to be <strong>floating. <\/strong>Their feet are oddly angled, as if non-weigh bearing.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of this Mosaic<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The main theme of this mosaic is the authority of the emperor in the Christian plan of history.\u00a0 The prominent location, next to the altar, shows the importance of Justinian.\u00a0 He has religious,\u00a0 administrative, and\u00a0 military authority.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What this Mosaic Shows the Viewer\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Justinian is shown participating in the Eucharist \/communion ceremony. He is\u00a0 holding the bread which has transubstantiated into the body of Christ. It is on a plate called <strong>paten <\/strong>that is used only for bread during Eucharist.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justinian stands at the center, represented as a priest-king.<\/li>\n<li>Halo shows the divine origin of his authority.<\/li>\n<li>He wears crown and purple robe, the symbol of divinity.<\/li>\n<li>Justinian divides the picture plane into two sides, as he embodies both Church and State.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>left side<\/strong> represents the state. Soldiers on far left are generic and lack individuality. They have shields with Chi-Rho, the first two letters of Christ\u2019s name in Latin. Dressed in white with purple stripes are the men of the Imperial administration. The beardless figure is the court eunuch.\u00a0 Figure on right is Belisarius.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>right side<\/strong> of the mosaic represents the Church. Featured here is Julius Argentius, the principal benefactor of the Church and Bishop Maximianus, probably because he played a role in the construction and supervision of church design.<\/p>\n<p>Ambiguity exists in the positioning of Justinian and Maximianus. This overlapping suggests that Justinian is the closest figure to the viewer, and he is central figure. Maximianus\u2019s feet are lower on the picture plane and therefore actually closer to us. Additionally, he is named!<\/p>\n<p>Which figure is more important, Justinian or Maximianus? This has been interpreted as a source of tension between the authority of the Emperor and the church. Justinian has never been to the church and Maximianus oversaw the work on the Mosaic. Was this his way of asserting his own power?<\/p>\n<p>The clergy carry objects for Eucharist, including a censer to burn incense and a gospel book.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2: Theodora Panel\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-506\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/51-Contunued-Theodora-panel.jpg?resize=700%2C498&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/51-Contunued-Theodora-panel.jpg?w=332&amp;ssl=1 332w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/51-Contunued-Theodora-panel.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This mosaic is positioned on the south wall to the apse and facing Justinian.\u00a0 Theodora ruled as co-equal to Justinian.

An icon painting is for personal devotion and worship. Icons were believed to be the religious figures depicted.

This simply meant people were worshipping the objects, rather than worshipping to them or using them to guide their thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>Icons became indispensable, personal mediums for spirituality and miracles were often ascribed to them. Many were fearful this was a relapse to pagan idolatry. As a direct result, icons were destroyed en masse. Today, very few survive. It is rare to find them.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 50.
