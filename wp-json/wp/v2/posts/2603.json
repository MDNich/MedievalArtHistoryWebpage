The u-shape and sunken plaza indicate that this was an area for large gatherings for worship. Archeological evidence indicates that the building was added to over a series of hundreds of years, culminating in a larger temple and an additional rectangular-shaped sunken plaza. The Old Temple lacked windows and had a series of elaborate, maze-like tunnels that led to the <strong>Lanz\u00f3n Stela<\/strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is representative of a central figure depicted as a feline head and human body that was worshiped.<\/p>\n<p>Those who entered the temple to encounter the <strong>Lanz\u00f3n Stela<\/strong> would need to rely on torches to light their way, which could enhance the possible religious visions.

Green materials like jadeite and quetzal feathers were highly valued, as they were considered rare and symbolically associated with life and death.<\/p>\n<p>These three cultures placed a large emphasis on <strong>blood sacrifice in their worship<\/strong> of a vast <strong>group of deities<\/strong>, and <strong>players of a ceremonial ball game would occasionally be sacrificed<\/strong>. They were hierarchical: a privileged, elite class dominated the political and religious landscape, building large ceremonial complexes as monuments to victory, the gods, and the dead.<\/p>\n<p>Architectural styles between the Olmec, Maya, and Mexica cultures differed greatly. <strong>Olmec pyramids<\/strong> began as early earthworks. <strong>Mayan temples<\/strong> were nine-level structures with single temples, and the <strong>Mexica culture<\/strong> built similar structures with twin temples.

Elaborate burials and other underground installations to honor the role of the underworld were also found.

Four major Olmec centers contain the ruins of public ceremonial architecture and numerous stone monuments, with pyramids dominating the landscape. Several themes and motifs present in Olmec art and architecture are repeated throughout the history of Mesoamerica. The Olmecs valued <strong>greenstone<\/strong>, as green represented life and nature, producing some of Mesoamerica\u2019s largest carvings in serpentine.<\/p>\n<p>Archaeologists have reconstructed Olmec beliefs by comparing their art, architecture, and writing with later, similar cultures like the Mayans and Mexica. The <strong>earliest known religious practices were shamanistic<\/strong>. Shamans interacted with nature spirits like frogs, birds, and jaguars. Recurring motifs like the feathered serpent and rain deity were religiously important to the culture, and this importance is reflected within the art of the culture.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2615\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?resize=893%2C509&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"893\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-of-the-Olmec-culture..jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Map of the Olmec culture.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Altar of the Children<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Most of the Olmec art we have relates to power and the supernatural world. A good example of a melding of these two themes can be seen in Olmec altar-thrones. These monolithic stone blocks have a flat top with a projecting edge. Originally considered altars, these blocks may have served as thrones. The front face of most altars follows a typical iconography.<\/p>\n<p>A ruler, identifiable by headdress, is carved in high relief, sitting in a large niche. The niche is like a cave and symbolizes the underworld, the source of supernatural power. The power of such a ruler, therefore, comes from his association with the gods.<\/p>\n<p>On Altar 5, this association deepens as we look at the child in the lap of the ruler. Although its face has been worn down, we can see a similar child carved on the side of the altar-throne in low relief.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2616\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900\u2013400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=805%2C631&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"805\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900\u2013400-B.C.E..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900\u2013400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Altar-5.-Altar-of-the-Children.-Olmec.-La-Venta-Mexico.-900\u2013400-B.C.E..jpg?resize=768%2C602&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Altar 5.

They would have been expressions of power and displays of propaganda for residents and strangers alike.<\/p>\n<p>The pyramids often enclosed tombs. A flat area at the top provided space for a temple. Access to the temple was by a long, steep staircase. The number of staircases reflects the number of entries to the temple.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Temple I<\/em><\/strong> at Tikal is a 145-foot-tall pyramid that was the temple-mausoleum of Hasaw Chan K\u2019awiil (r. 682-734 CE), the most important ruler of Tikal\u2019s 7th CE resurgence who defeated Calakmul, Tikal&#8217;s greatest rival, in 695 CE and oversaw a significant rebuilding program in the city. The most impressive new buildings were the massive <strong>pyramids <\/strong>known simply as <strong><em>Temple I and II.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The nine tiers of the pyramid probably refer to the nine levels of the Mayan Underworld.<\/p>\n<p>The ornate structure that tops this example is a roof comb, which would have been brightly painted. The talud-tablero <strong>structure of the pyramids is evidence of the lasting influence of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Another typical Maya feature is the sculpture of <strong>stone<\/strong> slabs to depict rulers and record their greatest accomplishments. Such <strong>stelae<\/strong> were set up in rows along the sides of the plazas. The oldest example of these stelae in Mesoamerica was discovered at Tikal and dates to 292 CE. It shows a ruler holding in his left hand the Jaguar God of the Underworld, probably a patron god of Tikal.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Historical Overview<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Tikal <\/strong><strong style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">Settlement at Tikal began from around 300 BCE<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\"> and, first clearing away areas in the jungle, monumental <\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">architecture<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\"> was built in the period up to 100 CE. The city&#8217;s prosperity was based on exploitation of natural resources such as cedar wood, dye from Brazil wood, copal resin, flint, and cultivating maize in cleared areas of rainforest and fertile swamp areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 378 CE Tikal was invaded by forces from distant <strong>Teotihuacan<\/strong> (or at the very least <strong>trade<\/strong> contacts were established) with a consequent influence on the cultural practices at Tikal, from clothes to art and architecture. From the late 4th century CE, Tikal was able to further expand its sphere of influence and <strong>conquer<\/strong> long-time local rivals. In the 6th century CE, the power of Teotihuacan declined, and other Maya cities, notably Caracol, sought military expansion, defeating Tikal in 562 CE.<\/p>\n<p>However, by the 7th century CE Tikal regained its place as an important Maya city, contemporary with such centers as <strong>Palenque, Copan<\/strong>, and Tikal&#8217;s greatest rival Calakmul. Tikal consisted of nine different plazas and courts connected by causeways and ramps and has, in all, over 3,000 structures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Xibalba<\/strong> (Shee-bal-ba) was the name the K&#8217;iche <strong>Maya<\/strong> gave to the underworld, and it translates as &#8216;Place of Fright&#8217;, which indicates the terror the place had in the Maya imagination. Only those who died a violent<strong> death<\/strong> avoided Xibalba.<\/p>\n<p>The underworld was a truly fearsome place, strongly associated with water. it had its own landscape, gods, and blood-thirsty predators. The Milky Way was also considered an entrance to Xibalba and the road along which souls walked to meet their fate.<\/p>\n<p>The Maya, believing <strong>the underworld had nine different levels<\/strong>, represented this idea in the gigantic stone pyramids they built as tombs for their kings which often have nine tiers. See, for example, the <strong>Temple<\/strong> of the Inscriptions at Palenque, <strong><em>Temple I<\/em> at Tikal<\/strong>, or the <em><strong>Pyramid of Kukulcan<\/strong><\/em> at Chichen Itza.<\/p>\n<p>The Maya also believed that each astronomical god had its own manifestation in the underworld. For example, the Sun God K&#8217;inich Ajaw, when he was travelling through the underworld at night, became the Jaguar God of the Underworld.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>most important Maya religious book, <em>the Popol Vuh<\/em><\/strong>, describes some details of the geography within Xibalba. To reach the ninth level of Xibalba, many trials and dangers had to be faced by the dead. These included the crossing of dangerous waters and high mountains, rivers of blood, attack by spinning obsidian knives and arrows, and even the sacrifice of one&#8217;s heart. To help the soul survive such an ordeal, the dead were buried or cremated with useful pieces of equipment such as weapons, tools, weaving kits, precious goods like jade, sustaining food such as hot chocolate, and even dogs (real or <strong>pottery<\/strong> effigies) to act as companions and guides.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2630\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Temple-1-or-Temple-of-the-Giant-Jaguar-tomb-of-Ruler-A.-Tikal-Guatemala.-ca.-700-C.E.-Limestone..jpg?resize=927%2C618&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"927\" height=\"618\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Temple-1-or-Temple-of-the-Giant-Jaguar-tomb-of-Ruler-A.-Tikal-Guatemala.-ca.-700-C.E.-Limestone..jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Temple-1-or-Temple-of-the-Giant-Jaguar-tomb-of-Ruler-A.-Tikal-Guatemala.-ca.-700-C.E.-Limestone..jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Temple 1 or Temple of the Giant Jaguar (tomb of Ruler A).

The <strong>Mexica, or Aztec<\/strong>, Empire followed.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>history of the Mexica is documented in the <em>Codex Mendoza<\/em><\/strong><em>.<\/em> Antonio de Mendoza, the first Spanish viceroy of New Spain, commissioned native scribes and painters to produce the illustrated manuscript recounting the history of the Aztec (or Mexica) Empire. This manuscript echoes the style of Aztec manuscripts created before.<\/p>\n<p>The Mexica (or Aztec) existed from 1428 to 1521 C.E. in the region of central Mexico. They began as a group of soldiers settling on a swampy island in Lake Texcoco. They called themselves the Mexica and claimed to be nomads from the mystical land of Aztlan in the north.<\/p>\n<p>The Mexica would forge the Aztec Empire in the span of a century. Because of a 19th-century popularization of the name Aztec, they are referred to by the name of their empire. However, within their own culture, modern descendants still consider themselves Mexica.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Aztec (Mexica) Empire<\/strong> consisted of the three city-states:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tenochtitlan<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Texcoco<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Tlacopan<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tenochtitlan<\/strong> was the Mexica home city. According to legend, its location was chosen by the god Huitzilopochtli, who told the Mexica their wanderings would be over when they saw the mystical sign of an eagle resting on a prickly cactus and eating a snake.<\/p>\n<p>The Mexica realized that vision at the site where they later built their home city. Originally on a swampy island, Tenochtitlan would be systematically expanded using <strong>chinampas<\/strong>, which were artificial islands built up as agricultural fields.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2634\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-of-the-Mexica.jpg?resize=759%2C433&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-of-the-Mexica.jpg?w=382&amp;ssl=1 382w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-of-the-Mexica.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Map of the Mexica (or Aztec) culture.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2635\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Frontispiece-of-the-Codex-Mendoza.-Viceroyalty-of-New-Spain.-c.-1541\u20131542-C.E.-Ink-and-color-on-paper..jpg?resize=588%2C881&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"881\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Frontispiece-of-the-Codex-Mendoza.-Viceroyalty-of-New-Spain.-c.-1541\u20131542-C.E.-Ink-and-color-on-paper..jpg?w=383&amp;ssl=1 383w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Frontispiece-of-the-Codex-Mendoza.-Viceroyalty-of-New-Spain.-c.-1541\u20131542-C.E.-Ink-and-color-on-paper..jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza.

The chief god worshiped was Huitzilopochtli (Hummingbird of the South), a war, sun, and fire deity. He was the son of Coatlicue (She of the Serpent Skirt) and sibling to the Centzon Huitznahua (Four Hundred Southerners) and Coyolxauhqui (She of the Golden Bells).<\/p>\n<p>The Centzon Huitznahua and Coyolxauhqui were jealous when they discovered that Coatlicue was pregnant with Huitzilopochtli and murdered her. Then, at the moment of her death, she gave birth to Huitzilopochtli who then killed Coyolxauhqui and most of the Centzon Huitznahua. He then dismembered Coyolxauhqui and threw her body down Coatepec Mountain.<\/p>\n<p>Other deities were assimilated from the cultures the Mexica conquered, along with the arts and methods of artmaking. This is evidenced in artworks like the <strong>Olmec-style mask<\/strong>. The natural features, square jaw, and materials used to make this mask are examples of Olmec influence.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2637\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Olmec-style-mask.jpg?resize=465%2C542&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"542\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sacred Cycle<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The ritual cycle celebrated events in two calendars: a sacred calendar of 260 days and a solar calendar of 360 days (plus five unlucky days and nameless days). The two calendars overlapped once every 52 years, when a ritual called the New Fire Ceremony would take place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Aztec (Mexica) Calendar Stone<\/strong>, a 25-ton stone, is often mistaken for a working calendar but it is a representation of the end of times. Aztecs (Mexicas) believed that the world had cycled through previous incarnations.<\/p>\n<p>In the Aztec (Mexica) account, there had been four previous suns. The fifth sun, which represents our current age, would eventually disappear from the heavens, ushering in a new age.<\/p>\n<p>The Mexica practiced bloodletting and human sacrifice to please Huitzilopochtli and sustain the great cycles of the universe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mesoamerican calendars<\/strong> had commonalities with European calendars, such as visions of the end of the world, both in the past (Noah&#8217;s Flood) and in the future (the Revelation of St. John). As in the Maya Long Count, Europeans started their calendars fixed on a single date: the birth of Christ. Aztecs (Mexicas), unlike the Maya, did not use a long count rooted in a past origin.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Aztec (Mexica) Calendar Stone<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Aztecs (Mexicas), like the Maya and other<\/p>\n<p>Mesoamerican cultures before them, believed that the world had cycled through previous incarnations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2638\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=270%2C270&amp;ssl=1 270w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Calendar-Stone.-ca.-15th-century.-Mexica..gif?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Calendar Stone. ca. 15th century.

She wears a necklace of human hands, hearts, and skulls along with a skirt of snakes as evidence of the deity\u2019s need for human sacrifice. The original setting of this statue is unknown, and it was found near Mexico City\u2019s cathedral.<\/p>\n<p>As evidenced by <strong><em>Templo Mayor<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar<\/em><\/strong>, varied manifestations of a sacred space reflect the cultural and religious context.

Each site was increased and superimposed based on the religious need, used to worship deities, and experience religious experiences.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Lesson Summary<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is classified chronologically and geographically into two designations: <strong>Native North America and Ancient America<\/strong>. Several cultures, including the <strong>Chav\u00edn, Olmec, Maya, and Mexica, comprise Ancient American art <\/strong>and include some of the oldest artistic traditions within colonization and migrant peoples, traditions that dominated the continent for the past 500 years. As part of worship in these cultures, artwork and architecture took on sacred functions to fulfill the needs in worship.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Cultural Misconception<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Bury Your Head in the Sand<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you ever heard that goldfish have a three-second memory? Or the idiom, \u201cDon\u2019t bury your head in the sand?\u201d Both are common slang, or vernacular, and misconceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Goldfish have a long-term memory of around three to six months. And \u201cburying your head in the sand\u201d is a reference to ostriches putting their heads in the ground when scared or afraid. In reality, ostriches put their heads in the ground to check on and turn their eggs, which are buried.<\/p>\n<p>Cultural background influences common misconceptions and ironically causes misconceptions about other cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Think about a different nationality or culture other than your own, and imagine what an example of an individual from that culture would look like, what they would wear, what they would eat, or how they would talk. You automatically have a certain idea in your head about each because you view other cultures through the perspective of your own culture.<\/p>\n<p>When <strong>the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in Tenochtitlan, misconceptions influenced their reaction to the Aztec (Mexica) priests<\/strong>. These misconceptions fueled the conquest of Mexico\u2014they thought that it was crucial to <strong>conquer the indigenous peoples and convert them to Christianity<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, a soldier who accompanied Hernan Cort\u00e9s on his expedition, wrote of his shock in seeing a group of foul-smelling priests with uncut fingernails, long hair matted with blood, and ears covered in cuts. They assumed, based on their cultural perception, that they were savages, when the priests were the most highly educated Aztecs.<\/p>\n<p>The priests were performing rites in honor of the deities they worshiped, including piercing their skin with cactus spines to draw blood. This shocked the Spanish Conquistadors\u2014they viewed the customs as degrading, and their accounts skewed the views of the King of Spain and popular opinion about Aztec (Mexica) and Ancient American culture to this day.<\/p>\n<p>An individual\u2019s cultural filter can contort the accuracies and\/or purposes of Ancient American art and its traditions. Examining cultural and religious significance without the scope of your own personal cultural and religious values helps achieve an understanding of the art and architecture produced within the culture.<\/p>\n<p>Overarching artistic traditions of the Ancient Americas exhibit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shamanism<\/li>\n<li>unity with the natural world<\/li>\n<li>animal-based media<\/li>\n<li>focus on the spirit as opposed to the appearance of subjects<\/li>\n<li>creation of objects that have a strong function<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2645\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Relief-showing-the-sacrifice-of-a-ball-player-ca.-500-900-C.E..jpg?resize=876%2C513&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"513\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Relief-showing-the-sacrifice-of-a-ball-player-ca.-500-900-C.E..jpg?w=524&amp;ssl=1 524w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Relief-showing-the-sacrifice-of-a-ball-player-ca.-500-900-C.E..jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Relief showing the sacrifice of a ball player, ca. 500-900 C.E.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2651\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vessel-in-the-shape-of-a-jaguar-Moche-culture-100-700-C.E..jpg?resize=648%2C827&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"827\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vessel-in-the-shape-of-a-jaguar-Moche-culture-100-700-C.E..jpg?w=358&amp;ssl=1 358w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vessel-in-the-shape-of-a-jaguar-Moche-culture-100-700-C.E..jpg?resize=235%2C300&amp;ssl=1 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Vessel in the shape of a jaguar, Moche culture, 100-700 C.E.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>What&#8217;s Blood Got to Do with It?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Historically, quests to heal the human body have prompted various medical techniques.

Maya. 725 C.E. Limestone (architectural complex).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Reliefs and Visions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The temples at Yaxchiln have <strong>several lintels with relief<\/strong> involving Lady Xok, the principal wife and queen of Shield of Jaguar the Great.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Lintel 24<\/strong>, Lady Xok is performing a bloodletting ritual celebrating the birth of a son to one of the ruler\u2019s other wives. While her husband provides torchlight, she is using a barbed cord to pierce her tongue to experience religious visions.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Lintel 25<\/strong>, Lady Xok is alone and experiencing a vision of a warrior emerging from a snake\u2019s mouth with a spear aimed at her. Experiences like Lady Xok\u2019s vision appear very realistic, and there is nothing in the artwork signifying that it is a vision. It is presented as if it is occurring realistically. This is a common trait in Mesoamerican art\u2014to display mythical events in realistic, figural detail. The connection between the spiritual and mythical was very realistic to the Mesoamerican cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Culturally, the <strong>spiritual and mythical<\/strong> had a direct impact on their lives, and therefore were represented in a realistic fashion. There was a fine line between natural and supernatural.<\/p>\n<p>Both lintels feature elaborate carving as seen on Lady Xok\u2019s robe. The artists commissioned by royals to create these works were experts and often the second sons of royalty. The intended audiences could be gatherings of priests and nobles inside small temples or for calendrical rituals or possibly supernatural, as many pieces were placed in elaborate graves considered to be in the underworld. The common citizen would be allowed to attend ceremonies celebrating significant events, but they were not intended to view the artwork. Each lintel is also an example of <strong>the important role that elite women played in Mayan society.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1058\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/155-Lintel-24-Structure-23.jpg?resize=386%2C526&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"386\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/155-Lintel-24-Structure-23.jpg?resize=220%2C300&amp;ssl=1 220w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/155-Lintel-24-Structure-23.jpg?resize=750%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 750w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/155-Lintel-24-Structure-23.jpg?resize=768%2C1048&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/155-Lintel-24-Structure-23.jpg?resize=1126%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1126w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/155-Lintel-24-Structure-23.jpg?w=1832&amp;ssl=1 1832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lintel 24.

Unfortunately, many surviving works were not scientifically extracted, affecting the evidence of the work excavated. Art historians rely on hieroglyphs, specifically those of the Mayas and Mexica, to contextualize text and image, historical, and artistic elements for those cultures. Spanish chronicles by invaders, friars, and colonists provide some information about monuments and artistic practices of the last independent indigenous peoples. Ethnographic analogy can also help identify cultural continuities\u2014present traditional practices and religious beliefs may give light to past practices and beliefs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1161\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/153-Nose-Ornament.jpg?resize=841%2C580&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"841\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/153-Nose-Ornament.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/153-Nose-Ornament.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Nose Ornament.

This can give light to the possible functions of different artworks or architecture.<\/p>\n<p>For example, art of the Ancient Americas contains objects that have a strong function, commonly religious. This can be in combination with animal-based works and demonstration of unity with the natural world. The <strong>Nose Ornament<\/strong> found at <strong>Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar<\/strong> is an example of both a religious and animal-based work.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>elite and royals wore and were buried with symbolic jewelry<\/strong> to demonstrate connection to deities and religious devotion. This example features two bird-like heads that attached to the ears, along with the central nostril portion.<\/p>\n<p>The Olmecs had a similar practice. They represented their deities in natural forms like animals. By comparing the Chav\u00edn to a similar culture like the Olmecs, we can understand the figural representation of deities as animals in their cultural context.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>No Wallflowers Here<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The interaction of art and audiences is also demonstrated in similar cultures, and comparing these cultures gives us insight into the cultural background of this practice. Religious rituals using masks with <strong>animal and mythological representations<\/strong> were used in Native North America.<\/p>\n<p>Native American tribes, which are culturally like the Ancient Americas, used transformation masks in their healing rituals. This mask is in the shape of an eagle\u2019s head, with ornate painting and detail. The eagle was symbolic of the deities worshiped and was considered a healing animal in Native American cultures. When the wearer pulls the strings, the mask opens, revealing a human face. The human face has bird-like features, including a sharp beak-like nose and flaring nostrils, and when viewed in firelight, represents the transformation from human to eagle form.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1159\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/164-Transformation-mask-closed.jpg?resize=564%2C433&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"564\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/164-Transformation-mask-closed.jpg?w=328&amp;ssl=1 328w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/164-Transformation-mask-closed.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1160\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/164-transformation-mask-opene.jpg?resize=568%2C452&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"568\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/164-transformation-mask-opene.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/164-transformation-mask-opene.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformation mask.

In Ancient America, art was figural, realistically represented mythical events, and glorified rulers. It displayed unity with the natural world and connected objects with religious function. Due to European influence, some methods other than archaeology, like ethnographic analogy, assist in finding the cultural context of a piece. Considering these elements will enable\u00a0unbiased research of cultural analysis and historical research of artworks.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>The Inca&#8217;s New Groove<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Cultural Chairs<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Cultures in Ancient America would build upon and borrow from the previous culture as each culture developed and then weakened. The Maya thrived in the decline of the Olmec, the Teotihuacan in the decline of the Maya, and the Toltec in the decline of the Teotihuacan. The last indigenous group before the Spanish Conquest was the Mexica, or Aztec. The art of each culture influenced that of the succeeding culture. The artworks of the Mexica, for example, reflected that of the Olmec, Teotihuacan, and Toltec.<\/p>\n<p>This is also true in <strong>Andean culture<\/strong>. The Andean region in South America was home to several cultures that lived in three significantly distinct ecosystems: the dominant Andes Mountains, a narrow desert coast, and the Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Art of these cultures is <strong>connected to nature<\/strong>, using, and incorporating natural elements, animal imagery, and plant imagery. The culture practiced artificial mummification, or embalming, of the dead, along with leaving items with the bodies in graves for use in the afterlife. Golden jewelry found in tombs was in natural shapes like birds and other creatures, evidence of both funerary art practices and the connection of natural elements in artworks. The architecture of the Andean region integrated the environment and was a representation of power and social hierarchy within the culture and community.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Chav\u00edn Culture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>One of the oldest cultures, the <strong>Chav\u00edn<\/strong>, was prominent from 900-200 B.C.E. They were a religious culture whose temple at Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar was the destination of religious pilgrimages to experience the <strong><em>Lanz\u00f3n Stela<\/em><\/strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is symbolic of a central figure represented with a feline head and a human body that was worshiped. The temple featured relief sculptures with images of the deities worshiped. Pilgrims would travel long distances in search of religious visions and messages. They would encounter the <strong><em>Lanz\u00f3n Stela<\/em><\/strong> in a series of dark tunnels at the center of the temple. The Chav\u00edn culture gave way to cultures such as Nazca, Huari, Chim\u00fa, and Chankas.<\/p>\n<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that a small tribe called the Inca defeated the Chankas in battle, marking the start of the Inca Empire.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2653\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Overhead-view-of-Chavin-de-Huantar.jpg?resize=529%2C429&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"529\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Overhead-view-of-Chavin-de-Huantar.jpg?w=529&amp;ssl=1 529w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Overhead-view-of-Chavin-de-Huantar.jpg?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Overhead view of Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2654\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Chavin-de-Huantar.-Northern-highlands-Peru.-Chavin.-900\u2013200-B.C.E.-Number-2.jpg?resize=414%2C530&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"530\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2610\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Chavin-Stone-B.jpg?resize=389%2C634&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"634\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar.

TWO PICTURES<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Birth, Taxes, and Death<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Within the lifespan of five kings, the <strong>Inca<\/strong> gained control of the west coast of South America, becoming the largest nation in the world at that time, and existed for less than a century.<\/p>\n<p>I<strong>nca<\/strong> administration was similar to that of the Roman Empire. Although ruling officials changed, local languages and ethnic cultures in the 80 provinces remained intact.<\/p>\n<p>Rulers imposed conformity in religious practices and instituted the <strong>Inca<\/strong> language, Quechua, as the primary method of communication. Like the Roman Empire, the Inca relocated groups of people within the empire to redistribute uncooperative tribes to loyal areas, while weavers, farmers, stone workers, and artisans were moved to areas where there was a need for their skill set. This contributed to the rapid growth of the Inca Empire and established a complex system of labor taxation. This system required citizens to contribute by providing labor for community-managed lands, for construction needs, for military campaigns, or for textile production.<\/p>\n<p>The goods and services produced were redistributed to the population in three ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>support of religious needs<\/li>\n<li>support of the emperor, construction, and military campaigns<\/li>\n<li>support of the citizens<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2656\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Map-displaying-the-Incan-Culture-shown-in-black..jpg?resize=489%2C693&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"489\" height=\"693\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Map displaying the Incan Culture (shown in black).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sweat Shops, the Beginning&#8230;<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The labor taxation system helped produce more than 20,000 miles of roads that encouraged travel and trade and ensured the easy mobility of armies. <strong>Inca textile production<\/strong> surpassed anything created before the Industrial Revolution, with <strong>thread counts as high as hundreds per inch<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The dyed woolen cloth of <strong>camelids<\/strong> was burned in offerings and used as clothing for golden icons\u2014it was highly valued was and was deemed appropriate for the gods.

The white-and-black checkerboard with a red V at the top in the <strong>All\u2019T\u2019oqapu<\/strong> tunic is symbolic of a tiny army uniform, indicating that its wearer was a soldier.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>All-T\u2019oqapu<\/strong> tunic has many toquapus that do not follow an overriding pattern. The lack of a specific pattern suggests that the wearer rules over many people. He is both the source of order and above it.<\/p>\n<p>Extensive agricultural terraces helped produce food to support the empire, and monumental architecture functioned as ceremonial and administrative centers. Examples of this architecture include Machu Picchu and Cuzco.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Machu Picchu<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The City of Machu Picchu<\/strong> was the royal country estate of the Inca ruler Pachacuti and was utilized by the Inca both as a secret ceremonial city and as a method to institute Incan presence in the area. It resides 9,000 feet above sea level between two high peaks in the Andes Mountains. Looking down on the Urubamba River, the city allowed the Inca to observe and supervise all trade routes and to enforce Incan supervision and influence over the acquired territories.<\/p>\n<p>The resident population was little more than 1,000, and stone buildings occupied terraces around central plazas. It consists of a large temple section as well as palaces, baths, storage rooms, and around 150 houses. Machu Picchu is surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population and watered by natural springs, and it provides an outstanding example of Inca architectural planning. The site of the city is laid out in several zones, including a lower-class residential district and the royalty area.<\/p>\n<p>The City of Machu Picchu was designed with sensitivity to its surroundings.<\/p>\n<p>Buildings were placed specifically so that windows and doors framed views of sacred peaks and landscape. This echoes the shamanistic views of the holiness of nature and exemplifies the instinctive grasp of the harmonious relationship of architecture to the site. The lower-status elite had only one toquapu motif and conformed to rigid design rules.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1073\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/161-City-of-Machu-Picchu.jpg?resize=853%2C850&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/161-City-of-Machu-Picchu.jpg?w=328&amp;ssl=1 328w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/161-City-of-Machu-Picchu.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/161-City-of-Machu-Picchu.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/161-City-of-Machu-Picchu.jpg?resize=270%2C270&amp;ssl=1 270w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/161-City-of-Machu-Picchu.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>City of Machu Picchu.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Inca<\/strong> were masters of shaping and fitting stone, and they carefully selected stones echoing the shapes of the mountains beyond. This separates the artist from the laborer, as the artist placed emphasis on the harmony of the shapes of the stones. Many of the building blocks weigh 50 tons or more and are precisely sculpted and fitted together without mortar. They feature minimal ornamentation as the Inca sought to display power through the size of the buildings as compared to symbols of power.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Astronomical Observation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ceremonially, <strong>one of Machu Picchu&#8217;s primary functions was an astronomical observatory<\/strong>, evidenced by the presence of the Intihuatana stone. The large, flat, ornamentation-free stone located near the main square of the city features a projection from the center, which casts a shadow as the sun moves across the sky. It has been shown to be a precise indicator of the date of the two equinoxes on March 21 and September 21, the dates when the sun crosses the equator.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Intihuatana<\/strong> means \u201chitching post of the sun\u201d in Quecha, and at these two equinoxes, the sun stands almost directly above the pillar, creating no shadow. It is at this time that the sun is \u201chitched\u201d to the rock. At these periods, the Incas held ceremonies at the stone in which they &#8220;tied the sun&#8221; to halt its northward movement in the sky.<\/p>\n<p>Intihuatana stones were extremely sacred objects to the Inca people, as they were believed to be the ties of the city to the gods. There were several examples of Intihuatana stones in the Inca Empire, which gives support to the high value of the stones in ceremonies. Shamanic legends tell that when sensitive people touch their forehead to the Intihuatana stone, it opens their vision to the spirit world.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>One city two functions?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Machu Picchu functioned both politically and religiously.

Andesite.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cusco<\/strong> features the same masonry techniques observed in Machu Picchu. <strong>Stone<\/strong> was regarded as a special, sacred material. Incas often incorporated living rock as part of a structure. Offerings were made on natural precipices, mountaintops, and other places with untouched stone. This symbiotic relationship enabled buildings to be adapted to natural features and natural features to be incorporated into buildings and cultural events.<\/p>\n<p>Incas used stone to convey political meaning as well as to interact with the spiritual world. The stones, similar to Machu Picchu, were laid without mortar and joined perfectly leaving faint lines of separation between the blocks. The stonemasons accomplished this by sanding and shaping the blocks to fit tightly together.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Qorikancha temple<\/strong> serves as an example of this ancient construction technique mastered by the Inca. Distinguished by the curved surface shown on the front of the building, the Inca originally referred to this site as the <strong>\u201cTemple of the Sun.\u201d<\/strong> As a temple dedicated to the creator god Viracocha and the gods of the sun, moon, stars, and the elements, the interior of Qorikancha was <strong>coated with sheets of gold, silver, emerald, and life-size statues of silver and gold<\/strong>. It housed <strong>mummies<\/strong> of some of the early rulers and was the center of a network of shrines and temples.<\/p>\n<p>The invading Spanish later built the church of Santo Domingo on top of the temple, converting it to fit with their religious customs. They stripped the temple of the gold, silver, jewels, and statues and used different masonry techniques to build the church directly on top of the temple. This was a statement of the disapproval of Inca beliefs and of the European mission to convert the indigenous people to their customs and religious philosophies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Summary<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My buildings will be my legacy&#8230;they will speak for me long after I\u2019m gone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Julia Morgan<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Native North America<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Ancient American civilizations like the Chav\u00edn, Olmec, Maya, Mexica, and Inca grew at an exceptional rate, resulting in densely inhabited agricultural regions until 1534 and the European colonization. But Native North America, the other region in Ancient America, did not have the same vast population.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Native North America includes cultures north of the U.S.-Mexico border from ancient times to the present<\/strong>. They were primarily hunter-gatherers, though agriculture appeared early in some cases. The indigenous peoples were widespread, unlike those in Ancient America, which had large populations close together.<\/p>\n<p>There are several regional subunits, including the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, and Pueblo, with great variance in religious practices and social organization between the regional groups.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2663\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Painted-elk-hide.jpg?resize=793%2C695&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"793\" height=\"695\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Painted-elk-hide.jpg?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Painted-elk-hide.jpg?w=363&amp;ssl=1 363w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Painted elk hide.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Commonalities were the ideas of harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and ritualistic participation. These shared ideas are represented in artwork that includes geometric patterning, mythical or shamanic figures, and animals.<\/p>\n<p>Artworks were produced in workshops, often with a master training an apprentice. The gender of an artist impacted artistry specialization. Art was produced at the request of a tribal leader, elder, or family member and would be viewed by the tribe in rituals, like in Painted elk hide.<\/p>\n<p>There are vivid images in red, yellow, green, and blue of the tribe performing a Sun Dance ritual. On the outside, warriors riding horses can be seen hunting buffalo. A lack of evidence doesn&#8217;t clarify if these events are occurring at the same time or separately.<\/p>\n<p>Storytelling like this often took place in paintings on hides. Animals were sacred to the indigenous Native Americans, so the use of an elk hide is significant. All animal parts were used to honor the animal. Native American painters would depict important events like battles, buffalo hunts, or ceremonies. These paintings functioned as records for the tribes and would be hung on the wall or worn by one of the warriors or tribal leaders as a tribute to their accomplishments.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Transformation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are varied types of two- and three-dimensional media produced in Native North America. This includes <strong>earthworks, stone and adobe architecture, wood, and bone carving, weaving and basketry, hide painting, ceramics, quillwork, and beadwork<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Many Native American artworks function as <strong>ritual objects<\/strong> to wear, carry, or use during special ceremonies in front of large audiences. The more active, or involved, an artwork is, the more it is believed to transfer life force and power. This is evident in Native American tribes&#8217; use of transformation masks with animal and mythological representations in their healing rituals.<\/p>\n<p>The Transformation mask is in the shape of an eagle&#8217;s head, with ornate painting and detail. Painting in dark red, black, white, and green was used to augment and accentuate the basic form on the mask, and this effect was enhanced in firelight. When the mask opens by the wearer pulling strings, a human face is revealed.<\/p>\n<p>The human face has bird-like features, including a sharp beak-like nose and flaring nostrils, and when viewed in firelight, represents the transformation from human to eagle form and a blending of those two forms. The representation of the eagle is especially significant, as it is considered a healing animal with supernatural abilities. The transformation is important as it demonstrates the oneness and harmony with nature.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1159\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/164-Transformation-mask-closed.jpg?resize=703%2C539&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"703\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/164-Transformation-mask-closed.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/164-Transformation-mask-closed.jpg?w=328&amp;ssl=1 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1160\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/164-transformation-mask-opene.jpg?resize=713%2C568&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"713\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/164-transformation-mask-opene.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/164-transformation-mask-opene.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformation mask.

When the Spanish conquerors entered the Mexica Empire and Tenochtitlan, they were amazed at the richness and beauty of the land. However, when they observed the priests during bloodletting rituals, idol worship and covered in blood, they regarded the culture as a repulsive cult. They destroyed the religious symbols and illustrated books, and tore down images of deities. Missionaries suppressed local beliefs and practices and worked to spread Christianity throughout the Americas.<\/p>\n<p>In the Incan Empire, smallpox killed much of the population, including the emperor. Treasures like the Maize cobs that adorned an ornamental garden outside the Coricancha were taken back to Spain and melted down. The Coricancha itself was stripped of its riches, consecrated as a Christian building, and the church of Santo Domingo built on top of it. These actions have made stratigraphic archaeology impossible, and archaeologists must rely on written ethnohistoric documents to help give cultural context to artworks.<\/p>\n<p>In Native North America, experts believe that almost 90 percent of the indigenous population died from illnesses introduced by Europeans.<\/p>\n<p>Many groups traded war prisoners as slaves, and the <strong>introduction of European materials influenced how the indigenous cultures lived and the artwork they produced.<\/strong> European influence affected the content and materials of the Native North Americans to the point that what is now considered traditional is constantly changing.<\/p>\n<p>The Spanish-introduced horse has become a cultural and artistic icon along with the indigenous buffalo; raven and bear and imported materials are now considered traditional. Archaeologists must rely on alternative sources of information for Native North American art, including oral and written tribal history, written ethnohistoric documents, modern artists&#8217; accounts and interviews, and museum records. Historical sources may be inaccurate depending on whether native or European sources are used.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2664\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/King-Atahualpa.-German-School.-Paris-France.-1533-C.E.-engraving.jpg?resize=749%2C656&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/King-Atahualpa.-German-School.-Paris-France.-1533-C.E.-engraving.jpg?w=749&amp;ssl=1 749w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/King-Atahualpa.-German-School.-Paris-France.-1533-C.E.-engraving.jpg?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>King Atahualpa.

Previously known as hunter bags and used by men, these bags were made of leather, embellished with quillwork, and used for various hunting and farming needs. With the introduction of <strong>imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon<\/strong>, the materials for the bandolier bags transitioned to cloth and glass beads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beadwork<\/strong> was learned from European settlers and initially mimicked the patterns and colors of quillwork. Quillwork was eventually replaced, and the beadwork incorporated European designs.<\/p>\n<p>As the bandolier bags evolved, they were no longer serving the original function and were worn by the men in celebrations. The <strong><em>Bandolier bag&#8217;s<\/em><\/strong> strap features white, red, and turquoise swirl patterns on a black background with gold trim. The bag itself features a pink, white, and turquoise floral pattern, a reproduction of the European designs brought with the colonists. These pieces became symbols of achievement for the women who produced them.<\/p>\n<p>Some Native North American techniques have been untouched by European influence. <strong>Pottery making<\/strong> in Native North America arose from a need for weather-resistant storage vessels. Traditionally in the Pueblo culture, women were in charge of the home and family, and therefore pottery was viewed as a female&#8217;s occupation.<\/p>\n<p>As time progressed, pottery evolved and the potters began to add creative touches to their pots, transforming them into a dominant art form among the culture. In the 1880s, <strong>Pueblo pottery<\/strong> began to spread throughout the Southwest with the introduction of the railroad in Pueblo homelands. Trading posts were established near reservations, and tourists and collectors visited to buy Pueblo pottery. Many female potters began to sign their pieces in the 1920s.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1109\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/166-Black-on-Black-Ceramic-vessel.jpg?resize=666%2C674&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"666\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/166-Black-on-Black-Ceramic-vessel.jpg?w=327&amp;ssl=1 327w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/166-Black-on-Black-Ceramic-vessel.jpg?resize=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1 296w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/166-Black-on-Black-Ceramic-vessel.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Black-on-black ceramic vessel.

With these techniques being lost, Martinez tried different techniques in order to help preserve the cultural art.<\/p>\n<p>The Black-on-black ceramic vessel is crafted in the same manner that Pueblo craftspeople have used since the foundation of their pottery tradition. The pots are hand-coiled, not made on a pottery wheel. Martinez crafted the clay vessels, while her husband, Julian, provided their decoration. While some may say they collaborated equally, Maria received the majority of the credit for their work, reflecting the matriarchal associations with pottery making in their culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Summary<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Native North American cultures developed alongside those of Mesoamerican and the Andean region but were less densely populated. The regional tribes, including the Northwest Coast, Southwest, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, and Pueblo. They shared ideals of harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and ritualistic participation.<\/p>\n<p>These shared ideals resulted in geometric patterning, mythical or shamanic figures, and animals in the artwork. The European exploration and settlement of North, Central, and South America had a significant impact on the indigenous cultures, artwork, and architecture.
