The beliefs of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism necessitated different characteristics in the sacred architecture and art. This is evidenced in how deities are represented in the art and the architectural designs. Trade transmitted both religious and artistic influence throughout Asia, and political entities utilized art and architecture to represent religious support of leadership.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Monuments of Faith<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>distinguish architectural elements of mosques<\/li>\n<li>recognize the connection between religious needs and religious function of architecture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Sacred Connections<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Think about your community and the buildings it contains.

There are elements that are specific to religion or culture, like the <strong>ark in Jewish synagogues<\/strong>, <strong>the cross in Christian cathedrals<\/strong>, and the <strong>mihrab<\/strong> in Muslim <strong>mosques<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The definition of Islam is &#8220;submission to the one God,&#8221; and its followers are referred to as Muslim, or &#8220;those who submit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Islam rose in Arabia early in the 7th century and eventually brought the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Its extensive advance was not only the result of military conquests, but also of the nature of the Islamic faith and its appeal to millions of converts. This advance resulted in altering sacred architecture in regions that were conquered to accommodate the needs of Muslim worshipers.<\/p>\n<p>The art and architecture of the Muslims represents the different techniques and ideas from diverse cultures that converted to Islam, and the impact of Islam was reflected in the art and architecture of other cultures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Art and architecture can have a sacred function.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Pillars of Islam<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2247\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2247\" style=\"width: 599px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=599%2C408&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?w=599&amp;ssl=1 599w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Koran-Manuscript-Asian-Gallery-1.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Koran Manuscript<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There are <strong>commonalities between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity<\/strong>. Islam incorporates Old Testament teachings, ethical standards, and rejection of idol worship. <strong>All three beliefs segment after the Old Testament.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Muslims worship without a hierarchy of rabbis, priests, or saints acting as intercessors. Muhammad was believed to be God\u2019s messenger and is considered the Final Prophet in a line that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He began to receive revelations of God through the archangel Gabriel and was persecuted by Meccan leaders who disagreed with his message.<\/p>\n<p>In 622 C.E., he fled the city of Mecca for a desert oasis called Medina, or \u201cCity of the Prophet.\u201d This exodus was called the <em>hijra<\/em>, or emigration, and is considered the beginning of the Islamic religion. Eight years later, Muhammad returned to Mecca with an army of 10,000, took control of the city, and converted the population to Islam.<\/p>\n<p>Muhammad destroyed all the idols and preserved the <em>Kaaba<\/em>, the symbolic center of the Islamic world. He died in Medina in 632 C.E.<\/p>\n<p>Muslims live according to the <em>Koran<\/em>, Islam\u2019s sacred book.<\/p>\n<p>This book was arranged by the Muslim ruler, Uthman, and contains the collected revelations communicated through Muhammad during his lifetime. It has 114 surahs, or chapters, divided into verses.<\/p>\n<p>The duties of the Islamic faith include the <strong>Five Pillars of Islam<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shahadah<\/strong>: Assert that <strong>there is only one God<\/strong> and that Muhammad is his messenger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Salat<\/strong>: Pray five times a day facing Mecca (where <em>The Kaaba<\/em> is located).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Zakah<\/strong>: Give <strong>alms<\/strong> to the poor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sawm<\/strong>: Fast during the month of <strong>Ramadan<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hajj<\/strong>: Make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime (if possible).<\/p>\n<p>The Five Pillars guide Muslims in the commitment and practice of Islam, and the reward for the faithful is paradise. Islam also features a union of religious and secular authority, joining religious and political leadership in one ruler. This practice continued after Muhammad in the form of caliphs, or successors, who took charge of the community\u2019s political and spiritual matters.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Is the Center of the World a Cube?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>The Kaaba<\/em><\/strong> is a cubical, textile-draped shrine said to have been built for God by Abraham and Ishmael. It had been inundated with pagan idols before Muhammad conquered Mecca.

Since the copies were hand-produced and were finely crafted, they were expensive and rare. <strong>The red marks<\/strong> function as pronunciation guides, and the chapter title, page numbers, geometric designs, and vegetal imagery are embedded in the golden ornament in the middle of the page. <strong>Gold is significant, as it is symbolic of paradise in Islamic culture.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>More Kufic and Naskh Images<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2250\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2250\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2250\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Kufic-Calligraphy-in-Chota-Imambara.jpg?resize=800%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Kufic-Calligraphy-in-Chota-Imambara.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Kufic-Calligraphy-in-Chota-Imambara.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Kufic-Calligraphy-in-Chota-Imambara.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kufic<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2251\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2251\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2251\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Naskin-Calligraphy-Hagia-Sophia.jpg?resize=800%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Naskin-Calligraphy-Hagia-Sophia.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Naskin-Calligraphy-Hagia-Sophia.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Naskin-Calligraphy-Hagia-Sophia.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Naskh in Calligraphy Hagia Sophia<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>To be granted a certificate Islamic calligraphers went through stages of intensive training.<\/p>\n<p>The center of calligraphy was originally Bagdad, before spreading to India and Spain.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Luxury Objects<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2513\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?resize=460%2C697&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"697\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?w=248&amp;ssl=1 248w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Court-Of-Gaymars.jpg?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Court of Gayumars, folio from Shah Tahmasp\u2019s Shahnama. Sultan Muhammad. c. 1522\u20131525 C.E. Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Calligraphy was used to embellish luxury objects<\/strong>. These smaller-scale luxury arts feature an immense collection of manuscript paintings, ceramics, and metalwork and are examples of both the range and quality of Islamic skill. <em>The Shahnama, or Book of King<\/em>s, is a Persian national epic poem by Firdawsi (904\u20131025 C.E.) that recounts the history of Iran from creation until the Muslim conquest. This poem is paired with manuscript paintings in the Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp. There are 258 illustrations by many artists in this book that was presented as a gift to Selim II, who commissioned the Selimiye Mosque.<\/p>\n<p>This specific page, <em><strong>Court of Gayumars<\/strong><\/em>, was painted by Sultan Muhammad. A non-religious work, it uses figural imagery to depict Gayumars, the legendary first king of Iran, as he presides over his court from his mountain throne.<\/p>\n<p>The image is placed off-center as if it is floating, and delicate figures of the court, animals, trees, rocks, and sky populate a lush landscape. This enhances the sense of lightness and airiness, giving the illustration a heavenly appearance and a reference to paradise. The animals, trees, and rocks support the text in the Shahnama, which states that wild beasts became instantly tame in the presence of the Gayumars.<\/p>\n<p>The poem, in calligraphy, encompasses the top and bottom of the painting. The manuscript became part of a private collection in the West and was eventually split and sold as individual pages. This is evidence of the Western collector\u2019s view that each page was an independent work of art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Metalwork<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Islamic metalwork<\/strong>, which encompassed <strong>metal plaques, vessels, arms, armor, and sculpture, was considered one of the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world<\/strong>, extending well beyond West Asia. Islamic metalsmiths would ornament the surface of vessels with scrolls, interlacing designs, <strong>calligraphic inscriptions<\/strong>, and human and animal figures. As these vessels were not religious in nature, the aniconism of the Islamic religion does not apply.<\/p>\n<p>The<strong> Basin<\/strong> by Muhammad ibn al-Zain is made of brass and inlaid with gold and silver. The practice of inlaid brass work was common from the mid-12th century forward due to a shortage of silver. Basins similar to this were used for washing hands at official political ceremonies, and this specific basin may have been fashioned for a Mamluk sultan for use in his palace.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2514\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Basin.jpg?resize=675%2C452&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"675\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Basin.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Basin.jpg?resize=1024%2C686&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Basin.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Basin.jpg?resize=1536%2C1029&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Basin.jpg?w=1770&amp;ssl=1 1770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Basin (Baptist\u00e8re de St. Louis).

Brass inlaid with gold and silver.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The skill of the work denotes the generosity of the patron, but the lack of a specific inscription means there is no evidence of whom the basin was created for. The artist, Muhammad ibn al-Zain, signed the basin six times. This was uncommon, and the exact reason al-Zain did this is unknown.<\/p>\n<p>The surface is decorated with three bands whose backgrounds feature stylized vegetal forms of inlaid silver. The upper and lower bands depict running animals, and the center band shows Mamluk hunters and Mongol enemies. Both the inside and underside are decorated with figures and animals. The basin was acquired by the French and referred to as the <strong><em>Baptist\u00e8re de St. Louis<\/em><\/strong>. It was used in the baptismal rites of newborns of the French royal family as early as the 17th century and is an example of both the status and widespread influence of Islamic art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Mughals\u2013a Little Islamic\u2026 And a Little European too<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Mughals were the most successful of the many Islamic groups that established themselves in India beginning in the 12th century, and they presided over a cosmopolitan court with refined tastes. Foreign ambassadors and merchants often visited, and the emperors admired Persian art and sought out European luxury goods. This resulted in <strong>artworks and architecture that had both European and Islamic influence,<\/strong> an outcome of cross-fertilization.<\/p>\n<p>Jahangir was the fourth Mughal emperor and ruled from 1605 until 1627. Jahangir commissioned a painting from the <strong><em>artist Bichitr<\/em><\/strong>, who portrayed his patron in both a European and Islamic style. The painting Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings features a scroll-like border with intricate vegetal patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Islamic influence is seen in the intricate vegetal patterns framing the painting, and <strong>the calligraphy is in two pairs of cartouches both at the top and the bottom of the painting<\/strong>. The intricate vegetal patterns are continued in the lower portion of the painting. Jahangir is shown sitting on top of an hourglass throne, with four figures to the left. The top figure is a Muslim Sufi Shaykh, or mystic saint, who is being presented with a book from Jahangir, below him is a Turkish sultan, then a full European style portrait of King James I of England, and then below him a representation of the artist himself.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-844\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-208.jpg?resize=500%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"729\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-208.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-208.jpg?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings<\/em>.

The tower of figures represents the social hierarchy in the emperor\u2019s eyes.<\/p>\n<p>The inscription \u201calthough to all appearances kings stand before him, Jahangir looks inwardly toward the dervishes\u201d attests that the emperor looks to Islamic holy men for guidance.<\/p>\n<p>By placing himself in the lowest place in the tower, <strong>Bichitr <\/strong>recognizes that he is lowest in status. He also portrays himself giving Jahangir a gift, displaying his reverence for the emperor. The hourglass symbolizes that Jahangir sits above time. The side profile view of the faces is evidence of European influence, but King James I of England\u2019s face is looking directly at the painter, as it was copied from a painting given as a gift to Jahangir. Jahangir\u2019s head is encircled in a radiant halo that combines a sun and a white crescent moon. This <strong>halo is a visual display of Jahangir\u2019s title of honor<\/strong> and evidence of European and Byzantine influence. This, in addition to the scrollwork and calligraphy, is also evidence of Islam influence, specifically from the Shahnama.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Calligraphy and Buddhism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the Buddhism of India, writing was always encouraged not only by monks and nuns, but the regular, everyday person who was Buddhist. This involved handwriting Buddhist scripture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buddhist Calligraphy <\/strong>refers to the lettering art that draws subject from Buddhist literature. The artists are Buddhists and secular individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is<strong> calligraphy of Buddhists. <\/strong>This form of calligraphy does not necessarily present words from Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Chinese calligraphy<\/strong>, more than half of the famous works from ancient China are based on Buddhist subjects or created by Buddhists.

The work starts with a title, main section containing spaces between paragraphs and a postscript. The result is simplistic yet elegant.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Inscriptions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Inscriptions were also part of Buddhist calligraphy.

He was a teacher, not a savior. To this day the Theravada tradition prevails in parts of <strong>India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>To those who, a few hundred years later, formed the <strong>Mahayana School<\/strong>, Buddha was a savior and often a god\u2014a god concerned with man\u2019s sorrows above all else. The Mahayana form of Buddhism is <strong>in Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, China, and Japan<\/strong>. The historical Buddha is Siddhartha Gautama.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>aniconic mode<\/strong> of representation is found in the Indian cultural sphere as well as in China, but it produced distinct modes of expression according to the different historical settings. <strong>Early Indian Buddhism<\/strong> (Sanchi Stupa) developed various aniconic types within the scope of narrative pictures that never show the Buddha in human form. Instead, his presence was <strong>indicated by means of symbols or by emblematic representations<\/strong> as well as by his \u201cnon-image.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>the Chinese aniconic phase refrained from any pictorial representation<\/strong> and only <strong>carved the words of the Buddha in Chinese calligraphy.<\/strong> The restriction to words on the Chinese side has the advantage that it provides written texts that can be analyzed, although the texts themselves never fail to suggest the limitations of language in the same way that suggest the inadequateness of images, as we shall see. Early Indian Buddhism, it seems, knew other ways to avoid the limitations of language: without leaving the confines of the pictorial, it found impressive ways to give form to the invisible.<\/p>\n<p>A record left by the thirteenth-century monk Dharmasvamin of his visit to Bodh Gaya is especially interesting considering the problem of <strong>aniconism<\/strong>. Like earlier pilgrims to the sacred site, Dharmasvamin did not find the living Buddha at Bodh Gaya. Instead, what he described is not unlike what we see in some of the so-called aniconic reliefs, for he said that &#8220;inside the courtyard stood the empty throne of Sakyamuni . . . which was worshipped, and an eternal offering lamp was kept in front of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>George N.

In 330 B.C., Alexander the Great conquered this region and familiarized its artists with the classical Greek sculpture.<\/p>\n<p>Starting about 50 B.C., Kushan era, the sea trade driven by monsoons increased. Thus, merchants from Rome and the Middle East passed through <strong>Gandhara<\/strong> on their way to Central Asia and China. Gandharan control of the high mountain passes vital to this international commerce made the region wealthy. The resulting cosmopolitan elites became some of the most powerful Buddhist patrons in all of South Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Gandhara\u2019s art combines <strong>(syncretism)<\/strong> local characteristics with elements derived from <strong>both Indian and western (Greek, Roman) cultures.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After the 1st century C.E., with the development of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism<\/strong> we begin to see many images of the Buddha in human or anthropomorphic form. These new, iconic images of the Buddha were particularly popular in the region of Gandhara and in M\u0101thura, south of New Delhi. They were depictions of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment, i.e. bodhisattvas. Many of the concepts characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism\u2014the later form of Buddhism\u2014appear to have developed in Gandhara.<\/p>\n<p>These <strong>anthropomorphic images usher in a new phase of Buddhist art<\/strong> in which artists convey meaning through the <strong>depiction of special bodily marks (lakshanas) and hand gestures (mudras)<\/strong> of the Buddha.<\/p>\n<p>In this anthropomorphic image of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment, the artist depicts Prince Siddhartha seated on a throne, surrounded by the demon Mara and his army, who attempted\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to thwart Prince Siddhartha\u2019s attainment of enlightenment. At the moment of enlightenment, the prince reaches his right hand towards the ground in a gesture mudra in which his hand is oriented towards earth, calling the earth to witness his spiritual awakening. In doing so he becomes the Buddha.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Gandhara Buddha<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2097\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Icon.jpg?resize=850%2C650&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Icon.jpg?w=420&amp;ssl=1 420w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Icon.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the body is hidden with heavy cloak echoing a Roman toga; its sharp folds echoing Greek Parthenon draping styles form concentric curves centered on the right shoulder.<\/li>\n<li>the face is elongated, the chin is quite prominent, and the corners of the relatively thin mouth are slightly sunken.<\/li>\n<li>the eyes are narrow under a heavy lid, gazing downward in compassion to the world<\/li>\n<li>the wavy Greek-like hair is gathered into a topknot symbolic of wisdom<\/li>\n<li>a lightly incised circle, called an urna, appears between the eyes.

After enlightenment, the historical prince Siddhartha Gautama acquired various marks (lakshana) that identify him as the Buddha.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>importance of the bodily attributes<\/strong> for any Buddha image in India and China can hardly be overestimated. Descriptions of these are formalized in the Buddhist canon, specifying 32 primary and 80 secondary superhuman attributes. For the most part, however, the local lists are homogenous.<\/p>\n<p>The major bodily attributes of a Buddha are witness to his completion of awakening and are, therefore, the only adequate way to represent him in human form. The Buddha\u2019s body is dignified, well proportioned, and extremely tall, with its slender and long limbs.\u00a0 There is a top hair bump, and the hair is fashioned into tiny snail stylized curls. Another mark is the urna between the eyebrows.<\/p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s earlobes are extended in reference to the heavy jewelry he wore previously as a prince. He wears a simple monk\u2019s robe, in keeping with his spiritual purpose, and sits in a lotus position.<\/p>\n<p>Fingers have all the same length, or special markings on the palms and on the soles of the feet. All parts of the Buddha\u2019s body, even features that cannot be represented, like his voice, are determined by his being enlightened.<\/p>\n<p>Often the face and the uncovered parts of the body were gilded, representing the light emitting from the Enlightened One\u2019s body. His skin was said to be of a golden hue, emitting light from every single pore.<\/p>\n<p>Other important attributes mentioned in the texts pertain to the meanings of his hands position, the mudras, which evoke ideas during Buddhist meditation or rituals:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>right hand over right knee (calling Earth as a witness to Enlightenment)<\/li>\n<li>right hand held up with palm out (symbolizing giving reassurance, \u201cno fear\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>hands held at chest with fingers turning invisible wheel (setting in motion the \u201cwheel of the doctrine\u201d\u2014that is, preaching)<\/li>\n<li>hands placed on the lap, left hand on right with fingers fully stretched palms facing upwards (\u201cmeditation mudra\u201d)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Mathura was a sacred place for the followers of Jainism<\/strong> who sculpted their deities.

The portrayal of his physical features follows the notion of a \u201cdelineation,\u201d which places every human being into a coded system of particular features that establish a distinctive identity. The Patriarchs of the Byzantine stated that \u201cThe icon of a man is not inscribed according to nature, but according to position.\u201d (Barber 2002). In other words, there was no doubt about what the historical, incarnated Christ \u201clooked like,\u201d because there was only one way in which he could have manifested physically in the world. Thus \u201can icon has to be seen as a living eyewitness of actual events.\u201d (Barber 2002).<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Natural and Spiritual<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>recognize symbolism and iconography of the natural and spiritual world in art of South, East, and Southeast Asia<\/li>\n<li>evaluate cross-cultural impact of religious and political themes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>iconographic symbolism, natural motifs, and themes of human\u2019s connection<\/strong> with both the <strong>natural and spirit world<\/strong> in <strong>Buddhism and Shindoism<\/strong> saturated non-religious art and reflected the continued impact from Silk Route and trade.<\/p>\n<h5>China<\/h5>\n<p>The foundation of Chinese culture is based on both <strong>Daoism and Confucianism<\/strong>.

The artist\u2019s goal was to paint the essence of the landscape, not to reproduce the appearance of it. The artist was required to understand all of the aspects of the li of the landscape and, therefore, would express the desire for the spiritual communion with nature that was the key to enlightenment.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1487\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1487\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1487\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/201.jpg?resize=500%2C1091&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"1091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/201.jpg?w=154&amp;ssl=1 154w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/201.jpg?resize=138%2C300&amp;ssl=1 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1487\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travelers among Mountains and Streams<br \/>\u00a9 Fan Kuan\/Corbis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In <strong><em>Travelers by Streams and Mountains<\/em><\/strong>, Fan Kuan relies on essence, as opposed to depiction, to convey the size of the landscape, embracing Neo-Confucian ideas.

Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as The Great Wave. Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji.<\/p>\n<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.<\/p>\n<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.<\/p>\n<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.<\/p>\n<h5>Content<\/h5>\n<p><em><strong>Under The Wave off Kanagawa<\/strong><\/em> is a Japanese seascape <strong><em>Ukiyo-e print<\/em><\/strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.<\/p>\n<p>The color palette is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Great Wave<\/em><\/strong> is a part of the series, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play, The Great Wave stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.<\/p>\n<p>The apparent symbolism <strong>points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism<\/strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the Ukiyo-e print represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang, the two opposites.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by Hokusai. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, The Great Wave was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the ukiyo-e technique.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques<\/strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.<\/p>\n<p>Hokusai has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa<\/strong> is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term Ukiyo-e means the floating world, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. Ukiyo-e prints were recognized by their emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.<\/p>\n<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in The Great Wave.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em><strong>Under the Wave off Kanagawa<\/strong><\/em> was created as one of the thirty-six prints by Japanese <strong><em>artist Katsushika Hokusai<\/em><\/strong>. Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.<\/p>\n<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai\u2019s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in The Great Wave, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.<\/p>\n<h5><em><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/em><\/h5>\n<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.<\/p>\n<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry.

Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son\u2019s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).<\/p>\n<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.<\/p>\n<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.\u00a0 The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Idealism + Politics = Propaganda<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The <strong>propagandistic properties of artwork<\/strong> also demonstrate power and authority, and the power of governments to regulate artwork.
