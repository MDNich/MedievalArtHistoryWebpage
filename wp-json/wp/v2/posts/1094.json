Persecution, genocide, and marginalization have shaped current identity and artistic expression.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Reconstructing the Art and Culture of Ancient America<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Archaeological excavation<\/strong> of works of art, monuments, and cities\/sites predating European invasion serves as the mainstay for reconstructing the art and culture of ancient America, although most surviving artworks were not scientifically extracted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spanish chronicles<\/strong> by invaders, friars, and colonists provide some information about monuments and artistic practices of the last independent indigenous peoples, such as the Inka, Mexica (also known as Aztecs), and Puebloans. These sources can be cautiously applied to earlier cultures\u2019 basic values and approaches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hieroglyphs<\/strong> of the Mayas and Mexica illuminate text and image, and historical and artistic elements of those cultures. Ethnographic analogy highlights basic cultural continuities so that present traditional practices, myths, and religious beliefs may illuminate past artistic materials, creative processes, and iconography. Other disciplines, such as astronomy, botany, and zoology, help identify siting of cities and monuments, as well as native flora and fauna subject matter. Like all art historical research, work in these areas uses <strong>iconographic and formal analyses of large numbers of artworks<\/strong> and increasingly employs multidisciplinary\u00a0collaboration.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Native North American Sources<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Sources of information for Native North American art include <strong>archaeological excavations<\/strong> for precontact and colonial cultures, <strong>written ethnohistoric documents<\/strong>, <strong>tribal history<\/strong>, (both oral and written), modern artists\u2019 <strong>accounts and interviews<\/strong>, and <strong>museum records<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Colonial and modern mistreatment of Native North Americans means that historical information sources may be highly contested. Divergent stories depend on whether native or non-native sources are used. Sometimes the stories converge in a positive way, as in Maria and Julian Martinez\u2019s revival of ancient black-on-black ceramic techniques, which was encouraged by anthropologists.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 153.

The head is at the northeast. The tail is roughly located in the southwest. There are seven winding coils in between.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Essentially, we are looking at a Native American version of Stonehenge. The head aligns with the summer solstice sunset or longest day of the year. Tail points to the winter solstice sunrise or shortest day of the year. The curves of the body parallel lunar phases.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps this was used to mark time or seasons. Maybe it was made to indicate when to plant and when to harvest. It also may have been used as a kind of compass in alignment with the Pole Star.<\/p>\n<p>The size is significant and must have had some desire to impress or amaze. Consider other large works like <em>Bayeux Tapestry<\/em>, <em>Night Attack at Sanjo Palace<\/em>, <em>Trajan\u2019s column<\/em>.

The egg by the head of the serpent is perhaps a representation of the sun. This might also symbolize a solar eclipse (eating the sun). The Shape of the serpent symbolizes the constellation Draco.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Agriculture in the Midwest US region led to a population boom.
