It is <strong>formal<\/strong>, relating to religion and politics. Yet, classical naturalism has been left out of this work.<\/p>\n<p>The images have a serious nature. The space is gold to show they are of a higher realm. This makes it look <strong>flat <\/strong>and the view is <strong>frontal.<\/strong> The images appear to be <strong>floating. <\/strong>Their feet are oddly angled, as if non-weigh bearing.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of this Mosaic<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The main theme of this mosaic is the authority of the emperor in the Christian plan of history.\u00a0 The prominent location, next to the altar, shows the importance of Justinian.\u00a0 He has religious, \u00a0administrative, and \u00a0military authority.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What this Mosaic Shows the Viewer<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Justinian is shown participating in the Eucharist \/communion ceremony. He is \u00a0holding the bread which has transubstantiated into the body of Christ. It is on a plate called <strong>paten <\/strong>that is used only for bread during Eucharist.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justinian stands at center, represented as a priest-king.<\/li>\n<li>Halo shows the divine origin of his authority.<\/li>\n<li>He wears crown and purple robe, the symbol of divinity.<\/li>\n<li>Justinian divides the picture plane into two sides, as he embodies both Church and State.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>left side<\/strong> represents the state. Soldiers on far left are generic and lack individuality. They have shields with Chi-Rho, the first two letters of Christ\u2019s name in Latin. Dressed in white with purple stripes are the men of the Imperial administration. The beardless figure is the court eunuch. \u00a0Figure on right is Belisarius.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>right side<\/strong> of the mosaic represents the Church. Featured here is Julius Argentius, the principal benefactor of the Church and Bishop Maximianus, probably because he played a role in the construction and supervision of church design.<\/p>\n<p>Ambiguity exists in the positioning of Justinian and Maximianus. This overlapping suggests that Justinian is the closest figure to the viewer, and he is central figure. Maximianus\u2019s feet are lower on the picture plane and therefore actually closer to us. Additionally, he is named.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which figure is more important, Justinian or Maximianus?<\/strong> This has been interpreted as a source of tension between the authority of the Emperor and the church. Justinian has never been to the church and Maximianus oversaw the work on the Mosaic. Was this his way of asserting his own power?<\/p>\n<p>The clergy carry objects for Eucharist, including a censer to burn incense and a gospel book.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2: Theodora Panel<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_506\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-506\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-506\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/51-Contunued-Theodora-panel.jpg?resize=650%2C462&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/51-Contunued-Theodora-panel.jpg?w=332&amp;ssl=1 332w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/51-Contunued-Theodora-panel.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-506\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Theodora panel \u00a9 Giraudon\/The Bridgeman Art Library<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This mosaic is positioned on the south wall to the apse and facing Justinian.\u00a0 Theodora ruled as co-equal to Justinian.

Before buttons existed, they were used \u00a0to fasten garments, such as cloaks and capes.\u00a0 Wearing A fibula (fib-you-luh) or fibulae(fib-you-lay) was a status symbol. Later pieces were used as a sign of the Christian faith.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Examining the Jewelry Up Close <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This style of fibulae was called a crossbow because it resembled the weapon.<\/p>\n<p>The side of an eagle\u2019s head appears on these pieces. Eagles were originally a Greek\/Roman symbol of Zeus\/Jupiter. Later these birds were used to reference Saint John. <strong>Garnets<\/strong>, red semi precious stones makeup the eyes of the eagles.<\/p>\n<p>The fish are in reference to Christ\u2019s miracle of loaves and fishes, when he created enough to feed hundreds.<\/p>\n<p>These fibulae had another use. At the bottom of each is a small loop, so the jewelry could also be worn as pendants.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who were the<\/strong> <strong>Merovingians<\/strong>?<\/h5>\n<p>The Merovingians were a barbarian group who ruled a large part of France and northern Spain.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the <strong>Art of the Migration<\/strong> period that was produced by Barbarians from 300-900 CE, this art became increasingly more Christian as barbarians adopted the religion.<\/p>\n<p>Fibulae were originally pins used by Roman military members. Barbarians later followed this example. These pieces of jewelry were commonly found in barbarian grave sites.\u00a0 The <strong><em>Merovingian looped fibulae<\/em><\/strong> were found in the grave of a wealthy Merovingian woman in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>Little documentation exists about Barbarians, so these works provide some of the only concrete evidence.

These communities were deeply Christian. <strong>Monasticism <\/strong>was extremely popular and an increasingly growing Christian practice. It involved the removal of oneself from daily life and distractions and pleasures. It was thought that it was better to live a difficult life so you could understand how good life was.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, we know a lot about this oldest surviving Bible in English, because of the <strong>colophon<\/strong> or statement at the end of the book describes the author. It was made by a monk Eadfrith. He eventually became the Bishop.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, a team of monks would work on a book, but Eadfrith completed this himself. He died before completing it, which is why some of the book remains unfinished.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>(3) 57. Pyxis of al-Mughira. <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Umayyad. 968 CE.

His father was a painter for Duke of Urbino, so he was taught skills early. He died when Raphael was just 11 and the boy was forced to take over his father\u2019s workshop. Soon, Raphael was known as the best painter in his town.<\/p>\n<p>In 1500, Raphael was invited to apprentice in Perugia, Central Italy, with master painter Pietro Vannunci. After four years, Raphael left to move to Florence, where he was inspired by the great artists of the time.

And unlike wood, canvas could stand up to humidity better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oil painting<\/strong> was imported from Northern Europe. It quickly replaced tempera, a quick-drying paint bound by egg yolk that produced a flat, chalky, opaque surface.<\/p>\n<p>This new medium was perfect for painting soft nudes and flesh tones. Also, when oil dries, it is somewhat translucent which allows reflection of light and results in a shiny surface. Titian even added ground up glass to his pigments to better reflect light.<\/p>\n<p>The use of <strong>chiaroscuro <\/strong>or the effect of contrasting light and shadow, created from light that falls unevenly, is applied here. \u00a0Subtle changes of skin tone are apparent from her neck down across her chest and in between her breasts. Then it runs down across her torso and abdomen, along her thigh and towards her knee.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve deep tones, Venetian painters would slowly apply <strong>glazes <\/strong>to build up layer upon layer of oil paint on canvas. Since oil dries slowly, the colors could be blended <strong>wet-in-wet<\/strong> (<strong>alla prima<\/strong>). On her body there are up to 15 layers of paint.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Proportion Play<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Titian manipulated the portions of the woman\u2019s body to make it especially elegant, soft, and rounded. The viewers eyes are drawn to her face, torso, and hips. Looking closer, her feet are too small for her body.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Complex Spatial Environment<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The figure is placed forward, on a soft diagonal, from the upper left to lower right of her body. The middle section shows servants from a back view, along with a chest.<\/p>\n<p>The canvas itself is divided into two, with the dark green curtains. This gives contrast to the woman\u2019s face and torso, so the viewer cannot clearly see the details.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Gift from the Duke<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Titian painted this at the request of Duke Guidobaldo della Rovere of Urbino to his young wife Giulia Varano. It is not clear to the viewer who the subject is. It could be Venus, a courtesan, or the wife. Since this was a private commission, Titian may have painted Giulia. It may have hung over the marital bed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What Does Venus of Urbino Represent?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This painting in an allegory of marriage in three parts. It represents:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eroticism:<\/strong> the woman is naked and represents Venus the goddess of love.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fidelity: <\/strong>the dog represents fidelity<\/p>\n<p><strong>Motherhood: <\/strong>is represented by the two servants in the background, as the younger one is supervised.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Venus in Name Only<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Naked paintings often had the word \u201cVenus\u201d in the title to make painting a naked woman more acceptable. That does not mean it in not a picture of a real woman.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story Unfolds<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>We know that the woman is sexually available, but faithful to her husband. Living in luxury is possible because of her husband\u2019s status.\u00a0 She is confident and possesses a coyness, as she looks right at the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Symbolism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bedsheets:<\/strong> red, sign of love and romance<\/li>\n<li><strong>Roses:<\/strong> are a sign of Venus and marriage and love<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pearls:<\/strong> are a sign of Venus (from the shell she comes from)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dogs:<\/strong> can symbolize fidelity and faithfulness, but also carnality\/sexuality<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cassone:<\/strong> trunk intended for storage of clothing for wife\u2019s dowry<\/li>\n<li><strong>Luxurious home and servants:<\/strong> wealthy family<\/li>\n<li><strong>Myrtle bush:<\/strong> common plant for weddings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Titian and the Reclining Female Nude<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Titian is credited with establishing the genre of the reclining female nude<\/strong>. He learned from his teacher Giorgione.<\/p>\n<p>Most female nudes are recumbent, posed so that the viewer can see them, and asleep. This made for a \u00a0pleasant and undisturbed viewing experience for men, as the women in these paintings did not know the men were gazing upon them. This provides a sense of anonymity for the men and an enticing sense of voyeurism.<\/p>\n<p>However, Titian changed the final detail. <strong><em>Venus of Urbino<\/em><\/strong> is awake. She is aware of the gaze, but she welcomes it.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Titian<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Titian (1488-1576)<\/strong> was considered one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance. \u00a0Born Tiziano Vecellio, in what is now Pieve di Cadore, Italy, he was an apprentice to Venetian artist Sebastian Zuccato.<\/p>\n<p>His first major commission was Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, in Venice, in 1516. His work <em>Assumption of the Virgin<\/em>, painted for the church\u2019s high alter, stablished his career.<\/p>\n<p>Next, he created a work, inspired by mythology, <em>The Worship of Venus<\/em>, between 1518-1519, one of several commissioned by Alfonso I d&#8217;Este, duke of Ferrara. \u00a0Wealthy patrons continued to hire him, including King Philip II of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 85. <em>Calling of St. Matthew<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Caravaggio.

There is also a window overhead in Contarelli Chapel which streams in natural light.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Techniques and Style<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Here Caravaggio uses <strong>tenebrism<\/strong> or \u201cdark manner\u201d There is extreme <strong>chiaroscuro<\/strong> or an effect of light and dark shadows. The images shift from dark to light very quickly without any shades in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>The painting has the Baroque characteristics of drama. The figures sit or stand on a narrow stage and the action happens close to the viewer. Caravaggio maintain the high naturalism of the High Renaissance but adds drama and intensity.<\/p>\n<p>He also employs <strong>radical naturalism, <\/strong>using everyday characters. These are earth bound common figures. Even Christ looks like a regular guy. He is barely elevated above his followers and there is only the fainted hint of a halo. Christ in this painting is far from the idealized beauty of the High Renaissance.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Dedication to Saint Mathew<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew <\/em><\/strong>is one of three paintings, by Caravaggio, hanging in the Contarelli Chapel, that are dedicated to the saint. Mathew was one of Christ\u2019s disciples.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew<\/em><\/strong>, hangs on the left, <em>Inspiration of St. Matthew<\/em>, is in the center , and Martyrdom of St. Matthew hangs on the right.<\/p>\n<p>The Chapel belonging to the French Cardinal Matthieu Cointerel chose him namesake Matthew as the subject of the chapel\u2019s decorative program.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew<\/em><\/strong> shows the moment of transition or spiritual awakening in Matthew. The work was intended to show the faith and piety of the believers and to inspire the non-believers.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story Within the Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The story is from the New Testament. \u00a0Matthew is a tax collector who sits with other tax collectors, in a Roman pub. The foppishly dressed men lean forward to greedily count their money.<\/p>\n<p>The light in the painting symbolizes Christ and it enters with him\u00a0 He delicately and gracefully extends his arm outwards to Matthew. <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew <\/em><\/strong>is Reminiscent of the hand of Adam in Sistine Chapel. This was intentional as Caravaggio was a big fan of Michelangelo.<\/p>\n<p>Christ points to Matthew and asks him to follow. Matthew is in disbelief and points to himself to clarify what Christ has just asked. This is one moment in time at the climax of the story.<\/p>\n<p>Three hands (Trinity) point towards Matthew. The light cast on Matthew is the light of conversion.<\/p>\n<p>St. Peter is the heavy, powerful, burly man turned into the picture plane, who blocks Christ from being fully seen by the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The History of Art and Church<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>During Counter-Reformation, the church wanted to use art to emphasize that a personal connection to God was possible. This helped to make Catholicism real and accessible.<\/p>\n<p>To pull the viewer into the art it used moments of transformation. Think Bernini\u2019s approach for <em>Ecstasy of St. Teresa. <\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Unique Approach<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>While Bernini used a saint in his work Caravaggio, chose art for the masses, by bringing the masses into his art. For the first time, a sacred Biblical episode was depicted as a normal realistic event in the same timeframe it was painted in.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Caravaggio<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artist Caravaggio (1571-1610) was born in Milan, Italy. He was considered the father of modern painting at the time. When the bubonic plague killed his family, while he was a child, he apprenticed with Simone Peterzano, in Milan. He was just 11 years old. Afterwards, he moved to Rome where his technique in tenebrism proved popular.<\/p>\n<p>The commission for <strong>Contarelli Chapel <\/strong>gave his work exposure and more work would follow.<\/p>\n<p>Caravaggio led a troubled life with drinking, gambling and fighting throughout.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 87. <em>Self-Portrait with Saskia<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Rembrandt van Rijn<\/strong><strong>.

The width and depth of the engraved line depends upon the angle it is used.<\/p>\n<p>Once the surface is cut it is covered with ink. This pools into the incised area. The ink is then wiped away from the surface. The surface is applied to paper with pressure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Saskia and his love for her, inspired Rembrandt to create this work. Prints were a way to make art accessible to more people, many of whom would later buy paintings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Couple Captured<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>This work is a double portrait<\/strong> or marriage portrait of Rembrandt and his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh. This is the only etching in which the two of them appear together. They look up at the viewer, as if they were just interrupted from enjoying a moment together. Both are sitting and a table and Rembrandt has a pencil in hid hand. He has been sketching.<\/p>\n<p>Saskia is shown as supportive and attentive to her husband. Rembrandt dominates the image and gazes directly at the viewer. Both are wearing historical clothing from the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Theme of Self Portraits<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Self-Portraits were a\u00a0 common theme for Rembrandt. He created more than 100 in the span of 40 years. He often posed his subjects in costume as a form of play acting.<\/p>\n<p>Rembrandt met Saskia while working for her cousin, Hendrick, who was an Amsterdam art dealer. They were married and together for 13 years, until Saskia died. This etching was created after the couple\u2019s second year of marriage.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art and the Dutch Golden Age<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Trade in the Dutch Golden Age brought with it incredible wealth. It was seen as an investment. It also subtly showed the wealth of the owner.<\/p>\n<p>Prints were entry level artworks that allowed new investors to buy, before eventually buying paintings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Rembrandt<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Born in the Netherlands (1606-1669) <strong>Rembrandt<\/strong> was a Dutch Baroque painter and print maker. He painted light and shades, while capturing moods and realism.

The \u00a0Battle of Belgrade in 1688 was part of Great Turkish War 1683-1699. The Hapsburgs were the\u00a0 Christian ruling family of Spain, and they battled Turkey and therefore Islam. So, this was a very contemporary scene.<\/p>\n<p>On the back is a hunting scene that is used to showcase the beautiful landscape, full of dense botanicals. The hunting scene itself, was from a print made of a French tapestry, owned by the Medici family.\u00a0 Hunting was a sign of status, leisure, and aristocracy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How the Screen was Used<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This decorative object was commissioned by Viceroy Jose Sarmiento of New Spain for his palace in Mexico City. It had the utilitarian function of dividing the room to make it look more intimate.<\/p>\n<p>The screen was also a <strong>conversation piece<\/strong> at the height of fashion in 17<sup>th<\/sup> century Mexico. This would have been viewed by important visitors and their spouses, who came to visit the Viceroy. It also served to politically connect New Spain with the power and events of the Spanish Hapsburgs in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The landscape side of the screen had a different purpose. It would have been viewed by females having a social get together such as hot chocolate.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Japanese goods were immensely popular in Spanish viceroyalties.
