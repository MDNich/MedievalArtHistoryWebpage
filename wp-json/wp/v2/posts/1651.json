He did not believe photography was art.

Some people said photography was just \u201cworse painting\u201d. They said it didn\u2019t capture any of the emotion of painting.

It examined the unidealized events and people of the period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Realism<\/strong> moved away from forms of the past toward a confrontation with <strong>contemporary issues<\/strong>. It renounced sentimentality and nostalgia of the past to instead <strong>focus on reality.<\/strong> This revealed contradictions and hypocrisy in our world. It illustrated <strong>discontent with political and economic issues<\/strong>. It asked the question&#8211; how does great wealth exist with great poverty?<\/p>\n<p>Realism did not paint heroes but <strong>paints ordinary people<\/strong>. The focus was on the experiences and sights of <strong>everyday life<\/strong>. Artists, such as <strong>Courbet, Millet and Daumier<\/strong> became the social conscience and documentarians of 19<sup>th<\/sup> century France.

The crisp precision of Neoclassicism was going out of style, but Realist paint is still not gestural like Impressionist paint would later be.<\/p>\n<p>The word <strong>realism<\/strong> means it has been painted to look true to life. This involves a large canvas with large figures, befitting a history painting \u2013 but this is not a history painting subject!<\/p>\n<p>Brushwork is rough \u2013 consciously rejected Neoclassical finish. Often people thought the work was not finished. The canvas often seemed dirty with muted colors of brown yellow and cream. Figures are isolated in the foreground with flat space and dark color.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work illustrates the artist\u2019s concern for the plight of the poor.\u00a0 This was advocacy (maybe even propaganda) for a class that has been ignored and not deemed worthy, either by society or in art. It is not meant to be heroic. This is an account of abuse and deprivation and exploitation. It challenged traditions of academic painting and asked, \u201cWhy are the wealthy the only appropriate subjects?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There was no commissioner. The art world was moving away from a clear patron or desire. Now, the art market had developed. There was an ample market for works that artists decided to create.<\/p>\n<p>This work was rejected at the 1855 Salon as \u201cinappropriate\u201d. The reaction to the work was disgust. Never had mundane activities and peasants been represented in art, unless ennobled and honorably working the land.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Courbet\u2019s comment on the painting:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I stopped to consider two men breaking stones on the highway. It\u2019s rare to meet the most complete expression of poverty, so an idea of a picture came to me on the spot. I made an appointment with them at my studio for the next day. On one side is an old man of seventy, bent over his work, his sledgehammer raised, his skin parched by the sun, his head shaded by a straw hat; his trousers, of course material, are completely patched; and in his cracked sabots you can see his bare heels sticking out of socks that were once blue. On the other side is a young man with swarthy skin, his head covered with dusk; his disgusting shirt all in tatters reveals his arms and parts of his back; a leather suspender holds up what is left of his trousers, and his mud-caked leather boots show gaping holes on every side. The old man is kneeling, the young man standing behind him energetically carrying a basket of broken rocks. Alas, in labor such as this, one\u2019s life begins and ends this way.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We see two figures work on the side of the road. They are stone breakers who are in charge of breaking up stones and clearing rubble so the roads can be made. This work was the results of industrialization<\/p>\n<p>They are dirty, dressed in ripped and tattered clothing. We do not see faces and though they work together, they do not communicate. Not only are they isolated from us, but they are also isolated from each other. The figures are that of a boy (too young for this kind of labor) and an older man (too old for this kind of labor).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Set in front of a low hill, it looks like the town of Ornans, where Courbet lived. The hill reaches the entire top of the canvas except for a small spot on the far-right corner. This effectively isolates the laborers and makes us feel they are trapped. Their entrapment is not only physical (in this painting) but also social and financial.<\/p>\n<p>Even though we know that the space between them and the hill is very deep, the colors and lack of sky make the painting seem flat and almost claustrophobic<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was destroyed in the WWII British Bombing of Dresden, in 1945. It was in a transport vehicle, with about 150 other paintings to a castle for safekeeping when it was bombed. Painted only one year after Karl Marx wrote <em>The Communist Manifesto<\/em> which impacted Courbet.<\/p>\n<p>The Industrial Revolution across Europe led to a two-class system, the Bourgeoisie who were factory owners and the upper class, and proletariat or working class.<\/p>\n<p>The message is that the Proletariat was exploited. They must unite and overcome the bourgeoisie to create the perfect classless society. Marx advocated for a violent revolution if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Courbet turned away from his wealthy bourgeoisie upbringing to adopt a self-imposed vagrancy and Bohemian lifestyle. This was unconventional with few ties. It was based on art, music, poetry, and free love.\u00a0 Think of Bohemians as the hippies of 19<sup>th<\/sup> century Paris.<\/p>\n<p>Courbet did not attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was not a formal member. This marks the end of the Ecole\u2019s influence over artists.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Making Comparisons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>While most traditional illustrations depicted peasants as quaint, pastoral, and happily at work, Courbet\u2019s work showed the exploitation of laborers and the realities of their livelihoods.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1508\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/113-The-Stone-Breakers.jpg?resize=318%2C195&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"318\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/113-The-Stone-Breakers.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/113-The-Stone-Breakers.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1660\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/113-Comparisons.jpg?resize=284%2C277&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"277\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-944\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Hunters-1.png?resize=543%2C303&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"543\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Hunters-1.png?w=543&amp;ssl=1 543w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Hunters-1.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Courbet<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>French born artist <strong>Gustave Courbet (1819-1879) <\/strong>was instrumental in the emergence of Realism.

If you wanted to become a great painter, you had to contend with the Old Masters<\/p>\n<p>Was Olympia a parody of Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino?<\/p>\n<p>Reaction was very negative. The public was so outraged by the painting that the gallery was forced to hire two policemen to protect the canvas. Objections had more to do with the realism of the subject than the fact that she was nude. She was not a Venus, not a wife, not even an odalisque (even La Grande Odalisque was acceptable because she was exotic and foreign!) This was a woman you could run into in the city of Paris!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manet<\/strong> was trying to capture modern life. Here he paints a woman of his time \u2013 not a feminine ideal, not a goddess, but a real prostitute.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Art for Art\u2019s Sake <\/strong>the phrase that wasn\u2019t coined until 1875, after this painting was made is indeed still relevant. \u00a0JM Whistler, an American painter, in a court trial is credited with coming up with the phrase. He expressed the inherent value in art, even if it lacks a moral, historical, or didactic message.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content: IMPRESSIONISM<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>How is this Impressionism?<\/strong> This is a scene of modern life, not necessarily the downtrodden who are exploited and toiling on the side of the road. Granted, many of us today would say prostitutes are exploited \u2013 however, from what we see of Olympia, she is a stable, well-off woman. We must remember the context of the period.<\/p>\n<p><em>Olympia <\/em>depicts a reclining nude woman, with a maid and black cat, gazing at the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Olympia<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Olympia is a prostitute (a common prostitute name in Paris).

There was something uniquely urban, sensational, and chic about modern Parisian life that deserved to be captured.<\/p>\n<p>Impressionists departed from tradition by rejecting perspective, balanced compositions, chiaroscuro, and modeling. They desired sensation from color and light.

This changed tradition. The artists who used this method to paint thought they should paint what they see and not bring items back to the studio. They brought soft aluminium tubes of paint with them. These were painted on small canvas, without the pretense of trying to be like history paintings. All materials were easily transported.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monet<\/strong> focused on capturing the essence of what he saw, rather than capturing formal clarity. The focus is on light, color, and atmosphere. Some areas are almost completely abstract, with loose, gestural, painterly brushstrokes. There is no sense of traditional modelling. This focuses on the play of light and color.<\/p>\n<p>The hardness of lines is dissolved by the light. He used rapid, swift brushstrokes to create transience of smoke and conveys speed. Light is filtered through the smoke and metal grid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is this compositionally different from a traditional landscape?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual movement going back in space<\/li>\n<li>Framing devices on either side<\/li>\n<li>Lines that recede and carry our eyes back<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Modern critics had urged painters to \u201c<strong>paint their own times<\/strong>\u201d. \u00a0A wide variety of subject matter suddenly became acceptable (and even encouraged) when previously this subject matter would have been inappropriate and unthinkable for painting.<\/p>\n<p>Charles Baudelaire had encouraged artists to be \u201cpainters of modern life\u201d. A painter\u2019s goal was to capture the very nature of modernity, distilling something essential from its transitory, busy qualities. The traditional Academy challenged this. Why paint what was viewed as ugly and unattractive? It was a radical idea to paint real life, but it was an emblem of modernity.<\/p>\n<p>A train is a <strong>symbol of modern life<\/strong>, which was perfect for Impressionist goals.<\/p>\n<p>Novelist Emile Zola said: \u201cYou can hear the trains rumbling in, see the smoke billow up under the huge roofs . . . That is where painting is today . . . Our artists have to find the poetry in the train stations, the way their fathers found poetry in forests and rivers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A series of 12 works were difficult to sell, however, as many buyers were not caught up with Impressionist ideas. Impressionists were not very popular in their lifetimes. This bothered many of them, especially Renoir. The term <strong>\u201cImpressionist\u201d<\/strong> was coined to be derogatory. It was used as a way of saying the artists couldn\u2019t paint. They could only make impressions.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Interior of Saint-Lazare station<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Train that is moving into the station under giant metal hanger<\/li>\n<li>Grittiness and dirtiness of the coal-burning steam engines<\/li>\n<li>Noise of trains coming in, people getting off, squeal of brakes, whistle of trains and conductors\n<ul>\n<li>Canopy of glass and steel; frames activities on platform<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Block of residential buildings with uniform rooflines, standardized fenestration (arrangement of windows\/doors on an elevation), and strong horizontal banding\n<ul>\n<li>Typical of Haussmann\u2019s architecture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Pont de l\u2019Europe in background \u2013 a large, star-shaped iron bridge.<\/li>\n<li>Connection between energy\/hustle + bustle of people, with the energy and power of modernization and technology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1671\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-Teacher.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-Teacher.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-Teacher.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Monet rented a flat near the <strong>Saint Lazare Station<\/strong> in 1877 and asked to paint the station. In the spring of that year, he exhibited seven of these canvasses.\u00a0 Having previously lived in Argenteuil, a Parisian suburb, Monet knew the phenomenon of commuter railroads. It was a very modern idea, that people would travel to work in the city. He viewed the changes in Paris very positively at this time.<\/p>\n<p>By 1877, Paris had been transformed through industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancements (Haussmannization of Paris).<\/p>\n<p>Under the direction of Baron Haussmann, prefect for Napoleon III, Haussmann was asked to achieve many things.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modernize boulevards to both widen and lengthen them.<\/li>\n<li>Build new facades on existing apartments and build new buildings (fenestration \u2013 arrangement of doors, windows on an elevation; use uniform rooflines)<\/li>\n<li>Build bridges to allow commuters to pass more easily over Paris\u2019s Seine and surrounding rivers<\/li>\n<li>Build new train stations to facilitate travel in and out of city, while increasing the size of existing ones. Saint Lazare is tripled in size.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This led to an <strong>increase of commuters and encouraged tourism<\/strong> around the city. An expanding middle class could support this leisure time and they had the money. Trains became faster, and more times were offered for travelers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>St. Lazare<\/strong> is still a working train station today. Visible in the current station is the eaved roof with glass panels at the top, like the one in Monet\u2019s painting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1669\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-The-Sanit-Lazure-Station.jpg?resize=462%2C347&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"462\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-The-Sanit-Lazure-Station.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-The-Sanit-Lazure-Station.jpg?w=317&amp;ssl=1 317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1670\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-Working-Station-toady.jpg?resize=522%2C348&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"522\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-Working-Station-toady.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/116-Working-Station-toady.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Monet<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>French Impressionist <strong>Claude Monet (1840-1926)<\/strong> might be best remembered for soft pastel shades, of his serenely beautiful garden and lily pond, at his countryside home in Giverny, France.

An image is carved or <strong>incised <\/strong>into the surface of the wax using a <strong>burin. <\/strong>Incise lines directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus while pressing down hard. This results in uneven, jagged lines where shavings curl up on either side and makes ridges. Rather than blowing or wiping those shavings off, they are left to give extra texture to the printing. This reveals the plate underneath. The printing part is cut into, while the non-printing parts are left uncut.<\/p>\n<p>The plate is put into acid. The acid eats away at the exposed metal parts, leaving holes. The plate is heated so all the wax melts off. The surface of sheet is covered with ink, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. It will be wiped away from the rest of the plate. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Aquatint?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A layer (or more) of <strong>powdery resin<\/strong> is applied to the plate. The plate is heated so it melts. Then it is cooled to create a hardened, fine, but still grainy pattern.\u00a0 The plate is placed in acid which eats away around the powdered resin, leaving small indentations in the plate.<\/p>\n<p>The plate is rinsed, and then ink is applied, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Different <strong>tints and hues of a color can be controlled<\/strong> by how much resin is on the plate and how long the plate was in acid.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influence from Japanese Prints<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Spare composition<\/li>\n<li>Tilted perspective; love of flat patterning; rejects Western assumption of 3D space<\/li>\n<li>Simplicity of line and form<\/li>\n<li>See figures from multiple angles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Repetition and Contrast of Form<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Note <strong>the curve<\/strong> of the woman\u2019s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Limited Color Palette<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The palette consists of only four colors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rose<\/li>\n<li>white<\/li>\n<li>brown<\/li>\n<li>cream<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This enables us to focus on line and clarity. From an artistic point of view, <strong>Cassatt<\/strong> was trying to imitate the haziness and softness of Impressionist form.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Notes<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Asymmetrical composition<\/li>\n<li>Spatial flattening<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>This is <strong>Mary Cassatt\u2019s<\/strong> exercise in <strong>Japanese techniques. <\/strong>It is based on <strong>ukiyo-e prints.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a de-eroticization of women, showing a boudoir\/toilette scene that is not sexualized. This is likely because of the gender of the artist. This is a twist on the traditional female nude that we have been seeing in art history.<\/p>\n<p>It captures fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are <strong>two cultural influences<\/strong>. While the work is Japanese in form (mostly), it is (mostly) Impressionist in content. \u00a0This was inspired by a woodblock print (in Cassatt\u2019s personal collection) of the daughter of a prosperous Japanese Edo businessman. Toilette\/boudoir scenes have their art historical roots in Old Master paintings. Think Odalisque, reclining Venuses, toilette scenes, and women bathing for example.<\/p>\n<p>This is a private moment of a woman adjusting her hair. <strong><em>The Coiffure <\/em><\/strong>means \u201cHairdo\u201d in French.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>ritual of getting dressed<\/strong> for the day had a great deal to do with status, based on royal rituals with Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette. To wear elaborate hairstyles, one needed a maid. Yet, the woman here is tending to her hair alone. We see a working woman. This can be a comparison between the historically elite nature of the event vs. the everyday normalcy of this woman.<\/p>\n<p>There is a <strong>voyeuristic element<\/strong>, but the body is not sexualized. Though her breasts are exposed, her chest and the details of her body are otherwise muted. No anatomical accuracy or detail is given.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The was a wave of <strong>Japonisme<\/strong> spreading across Europe. In 1854, US Naval commodore Matthew Perry forcibly opened Japan to Western trade. Japanese goods flooded into Europe for the first time since the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century. Lacquers, fans, bronzes, hanging scrolls, kimonos, ceramics, illustrated books, and ukiyo-e prints were all popular. This inspired a Japanese style across Western art.<\/p>\n<p>In 1890, Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris showcased an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints. <strong>Mary Cassatt<\/strong> was in the audience and was absolutely taken with these prints.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two of the prints she saw&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1675\"

The band closest to us has foliage and houses. Rough patches of <strong>yellow, emerald, and green<\/strong> suggest a wide plain. <strong>Blues, violets, and grays<\/strong> form the mountain surrounded by sky. This alludes to atmospheric perspective through the bluish gray of the background. With its <strong>sketchy outlines <\/strong>this was not considered \u201cfinished\u201d by academic standards of the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>C\u00e9zanne <\/strong>used <strong>blocks of color<\/strong> to create forms and <strong>evenly distributed lighting. <\/strong>Our viewpoint is elevated, though we do not see how. Presumably, we are on another mountain. This in conjunction with the high horizon line allows us to see more of the valley.<\/p>\n<p>A complicated pattern of diagonals can be found in each of the roofs, lines of the mountain, and arrangement of patches on the plain. This creates a deep, unified space that our eye can travel in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flatness coexists with depth. <\/strong>Somehow, he has flattened everything by making forms using rectangular swabs of paint. Yet, we understand the illusion. Things recede backwards.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is yet <strong>another study on this mountain and valley<\/strong>.

In other words, when we flatten something, inherently we understand that to mean that we can only see one side.

Each time he painted it differently than the time before.

Although <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> thought they were close friends, Gauguin denied feeling close to <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> at all and doesn\u2019t want a partnership.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> cut off his ear and delivered his ear to a prostitute. Later, he asked what had happened to him, as he had no recollection.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> was hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, in Saint-Remy, in southern France, a clinic for the mentally ill. During his convalescence here, <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> was encouraged to paint by his brother Theo. The artist often chewed his paint brushes. Paint was made with led, which could cause difficulty focusing and halos in front of the eyes. This is caused by lead-induced enlargement of retina.<\/p>\n<p>He was medicated with a plant called the foxglove. If given too much of the drug, it causes patients to experience yellow too intensely.<\/p>\n<p>While staying in Saint Remy hospital in southern France, he was able to spend hours contemplating the stars without interference from gas or electric city streetlights. He had never seen the night sky like this.<\/p>\n<p>In 1890, <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> shot himself in the chest, while standing in a wheat field. \u00a0There were no witnesses and he died there two days later.

He then abandoned his family and wanted to leave behind all that was \u201cartificial\u201d.\u00a0 He complained that Tahiti was not as exotic as he expected. As a French colony, he said it had already been destroyed by missionaries and disease.

We would expect the sky to be blue and the land to be orange, but he has swapped this. The high horizon line lets us see more of the landscape than sky.<\/p>\n<p>The strict linearity on the left contrasts with the curves and rounded shapes on the right. The foreground and background blend into one another. Wide curves of the figure are repeated in the landscape, and it literally ripples through or affects the man\u2019s body.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is part of Munch\u2019s semi-autobiographical cycle \u201cThe Frieze of Life\u201d, painting not what he saw, but what he felt. It shows internal emotion through external form. This is Munch\u2019s feelings\/experience of <strong>synesthesia<\/strong> or the union of senses. It\u2019s a visual depiction of sound and emotion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask yourself:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How does one convey experiences that are not visual?<\/p>\n<p>How does one convey sensations that we experience with more than one sense?<\/p>\n<p>Can art be used to depict sound, perception, anxiety?<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The theme of this work is <strong>death, dread, and anxiety<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Three main areas illustrate this.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>bridge<\/strong> extends at a steep angle from the middle distance at left to fill the foreground<\/p>\n<p><strong>Human figures<\/strong> also display this. A <strong>screaming figure<\/strong> in the foreground, is linked to the landscape, as both are made of curves. One feels the cry of nature, a sound that is sensed rather than heard. The figure\u2019s face resembles a Peruvian mummy that was exhibited at the World\u2019s Fair in Paris in 1889. Many artists were inspired by this.<\/p>\n<p>There are <strong>two rigid figures<\/strong> on the back of the bridge. Are they coming or going?<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>landscape<\/strong> also represents the theme. The shoreline, lake, hills, and churning sky are reflected on the water.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Symbolism?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Symbolism<\/strong> expresses emotion and ideas. It ignores naturalism. Symbolist artists came from diverse international backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not the chair which should be painted, but the human\u2019s relation to it\u201d. In other words, it expresses emotion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Decline of the Traditional Art School<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This was a <strong>Norwegian artist<\/strong>. The art world was expanding. One no longer had to be French, Italian, or Dutch. Therefore, traditional art schools were declining in their power and necessity in the art world.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influences on the Work<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Both his mother and sister died when <strong>Munch<\/strong> was a child. The artist was ill, depressed much of his life and suffered from synaesthesia.<\/p>\n<p>Passage in his diary dated January 22<sup>nd<\/sup>, 1892, written in Nice, France likely is the inspiration for this piece.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>I was walking along the road with two friends. The sun went down, and I felt a gust of melancholy. Suddenly, the sky turned a bloody red. I stopped, leaned against the railing, tired to death, as the flaming skies hung like blood and sword over the city. My friends went on, but I stood there, trembling with anxiety, and I felt a vast and infinite scream tear through nature.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What could this have been? What was he inspired by?<\/p>\n<p>The unnaturally harsh colors were likely observed by <strong>Munch<\/strong>. It may have been due to volcanic dust from the eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883.

The correspondence reveals that the Calais mayor tried to keep Rodin\u2019s interest in the project despite their disagreements and delays.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>patrons were so disappointed<\/strong>, they did not want to purchase it. They wanted one statue of Eustache since he was the council leader of the burghers. And where was the pedestal?<\/p>\n<p>They did not like that the men were unidealized and emotional. They thought this display of male emotion was inappropriate, and made them look vulnerable and weak, instead of ennobled.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rodin gave them a version with a pedestal<\/strong> to satisfy them. Then, <strong>he made a second version without a pedestal for himself.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The patrons were still so disappointed, they did not order additional castings like they had discussed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>One Moment in Time<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Look at the choice in <strong>the moment of the narrative<\/strong> (have not discussed this since Baroque art!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rodin<\/strong> does not show these men when they were released. Instead, he shows them in the moment they gather to go to their deaths. We see them in agony. Instead of elating the men in the moment of full knowledge that they will not die, he shows us that the threat of death is very real.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Men<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Six men appear \u2013 these are the <strong>burghers<\/strong> (councilmen) of Calais. They are wearing only simple tattered sackcloth (<strong>King Edward humiliated them by making them wear sackcloth<\/strong> to reinforce his power over them). The clothing anchors them to the ground. There is no escaping their fate.<\/p>\n<p>They appear <strong>thin and malnourished<\/strong>. The city had been besieged for 11 months. The man with the beard is <strong>Eustache de Saint-Pierre.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The men stand together, but they do not make eye contact or interact with one another. Each is reflecting on their own choice and their own sense of loss.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some have their heads bowed.<\/li>\n<li>Some raise their hands.<\/li>\n<li>Others gaze out into the distance (one with key to the city: Jean d\u2019Aire).<\/li>\n<li>Some plea.<\/li>\n<li>They are united then not through contact but by their posture and circumstance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Warring and Death<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Calais was besieged for 11 months with dwindling food and water. To end the assault on the French, English King Edward III made a deal with the city of Calais.
