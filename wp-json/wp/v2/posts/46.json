Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or intended audience.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Near East and dynastic Egypt<\/strong> these functions sometimes changed overtime, ultimately affecting the art and artist traditions, that were focused on representing royal figures and divinities.\u00a0 This also applied to the function of <strong>funerary and palatial complexes<\/strong> within their cultural contexts.<\/p>\n<p>Architectural representations include towering ziggurats that provide monumental settings for the worship of many deities, as well as heavily fortified palaces that increased in opulence over the centuries. All were to proclaim the power and authority of rulers.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is a Ka Statue? <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A ka statue is a statue to house the ka, or the spirit, after death. It is part of the culture of dynastic Egypt, represented by an elaborate funerary sect. The devotees created numerous ka statues, as well as artifacts, decorations, and furnishings for tombs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Basis of Art from Ancient Greece and Rome<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The art of <strong>Ancient Greece and Rome<\/strong> is grounded in <strong>civic ideals<\/strong> and <strong>polytheism<\/strong>. <strong>Etruscan and ancient Roman <\/strong>art express <strong>republican and imperial values, power<\/strong>, and preference for <strong>conspicuous display<\/strong>.

The figures show a <strong>twisted perspective<\/strong>, in that they are viewed in profile, with the shoulders facing forward. This work also shows a <strong>hierarchy of scale<\/strong>. The seated figure (god) would be displayed as the taller figure if standing.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Images Up Close<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This one is representational of the law and designed in three sections.<\/p>\n<p>At the top is a carved relief of King Hammurabi on the left, who ruled Babylonia from 1792-1750 BCE.<\/p>\n<p>To the right is Shamash, the sun god and god of justice, indicated by the horned crown on his head and the beams of divine light radiating from his shoulders. The god is seated on a temple throne or <strong>ziggurat<\/strong> that is perched upon mountains. He is gifting the king with a rope, rod, and ring, as a sign of power. Hammurabi on the left is speaking in greeting, while gesturing. He stands respectfully in front of Shamash.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Text<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are three passages. The first is the justification of Hammurabi as king as well as a glorification.\u00a0 Below this is a section of 300 laws, inscribed in <strong>cuneiform script<\/strong>, in the <strong>Akkadian language<\/strong>. This determines the result of any wrong actions, which has already been established through legal precedence.<\/p>\n<p>For example, it says:<\/p>\n<p><em>If a man builds a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls and kills its owner, then the builder shall be put to death. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>The third section of text is a poem praising Hammurabi\u2019s virtues.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of The Code of Hammurabi <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was crafted to ensure that the laws were known to the public. It includes images, as the literacy rate was extremely low in ancient civilizations. These laws give a sense in history to what was important in Babylonian laws.<\/p>\n<p>It also glorified Hammurabi, as a pious and obedient ruler. The poem on the stele makes it clear that he is responsible for bringing the law to the people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work is the <strong>earliest law code ever written<\/strong> and likely predates the Old Testament commandments.

At the time, there was no Egyptian word for queen&#8211;just king\u2019s wife or king\u2019s mother. She was daughter of Thutmose I, and wife\/sister of Thutmose II who died. No legitimate heir was old enough to rule.<\/p>\n<p>Hatshepsut took the throne over her nephew\/stepson Thutmose III. She gradually increased her role of regent to that of pharaoh.<\/p>\n<p>She claimed an oracle had predicted she would be pharaoh and that she was born from the gods. No knowledge of how she died or was superseded was ever uncovered. We do know that Thutmose III destroyed many records about her after her death.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Worshipping the Sun God<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This temple was built for Hatshepsut, so she could worship Amun-Rae, the sun god. Originally the gardens were planted with trees and 200 sculptures.<\/p>\n<p>One of the sculptures that would have been in the garden was <strong><em>The Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsu<\/em><\/strong>t. The large granite sculpture shows the ruler kneeling for the sun god. An inscription on the work says she is making an offering.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_274\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-274\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=350%2C634&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?w=169&amp;ssl=1 169w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=166%2C300&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-274\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kneeling statue of Hatshepsut<br \/>Image \u00a9 The Metropolitan Museum of<br \/>Art\/Image source \u00a9 Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Hatshepsut is dressed in the costume of male pharaohs, with a royal headdress and false ceremonial beard.

The great expense it took to create this work, was a display of status and prestige, as well as the deification of Tut.<\/p>\n<p>The bright colouring indicated a better life in the after world. Special symbols were included to help the body ward off spirits.

He was a sickly child and died by the age of 18, but not before marrying his sister. His tomb was small, which leaves historians to assume that his death was sudden and unexpected. With his brief life he was a minor figure in Egyptian history.<\/p>\n<p>King Tut did manage to accomplish a few things in his short time frame. He overturned his father\u2019s interest in the Amarna art and worship of Aten. He restored Egyptian religion to polytheism and Egyptian art to traditional styles.<\/p>\n<p>His name, TutankhAMUN, is a reference to restoring power to the old god Amun.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why was King Tut and his tomb so famous?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>It was the only royal tomb untouched, until it discovered by British Howard Carter, in 1922. Interestingly, there is <strong>a curse associated<\/strong> with the tomb, with many stories about people who were in mysterious accidents or died after encountering it.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2015, the funerary mask was damaged in cleaning. The beard was knocked off and a restorationist epoxied it back on in a messy fashion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 30.

This building was created <strong>by architects<\/strong> <strong>Iktinos and Kallikrates. <\/strong>It is <strong>1,150 feet long. <\/strong>Interior d\u00e9cor was provided by <strong>artist Phidias.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Parthenon was dedicated to the goddess Athena. It glorified Athena Parthenos, the later word meaning virgin, which was highly valued in Athenian society. The goddess was an enforcer of such modesty. The Panathenaic Procession was a celebration of Athena\u2019s birthday.<\/p>\n<p>The north side was the temple of earlier sects and dedicated to earlier gods. The south side contained temples dedicated to Athena. All Athenians citizens were able to take part in the festivals. Only priests were allowed inside.<\/p>\n<p>The building was also a celebration of the Greek victory over the Persians, while showcasing the Athenian wealth and power.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Build<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The front and back look the same, which was entirely intentional.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marble<\/strong> at the time was cheap and available. The roof was originally made with wood and capped with marble tiles. It would have been brightly painted at the time, so viewers could easily see and interpret the decorations.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Architectural Terms<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Peripteral<\/strong> temple is a temple with a <strong>colonnade <\/strong>on all four sides and based on <strong>peristyle<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Orders<\/strong> is style represented by <strong>columns and entablature<\/strong>. The types used in this building are Doric and Ionic. <strong>Doric <\/strong>was used for is the exterior, with fluted shafts, simple <strong>capitals<\/strong>, and <strong>entablature<\/strong> of <strong>triglyphs<\/strong> and <strong>metopes<\/strong>. <strong>Ionic <\/strong>was used is the interior and used fluted shafts, <strong>volute<\/strong> capitals, with entablature of frieze.<\/p>\n<p>It was very unusual to combine orders. Art historians believe this was to show a united Greece, with the Doric representing the mainland style and the Iconic the preferred style of the Greek islands.<\/p>\n<p>The building\u2019s <strong>pediment, <\/strong>a trianglar part at the\u00a0top front of the building that supports the roof was highly carved.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>A Series of Optical Illusions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Adjustments were made in the architecture to compensate for optical illusions. A <strong>stylobate <\/strong>or continuous base supporting the row of columns curves upward from center, as does the <strong>entablature<\/strong>. This acts to deflect the appearance of sagging in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>The columns lean inward slightly. If the lines the were continued they would all meet 1.5 miles above the temple. \u00a0These columns are not evenly spaced to prevent the look of them being clustered.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Entasis <\/strong>is a slight convex curve in the shaft of a column. The columns bulge out in the middle, and this works to give the illusion that they are straight and taper upward.<\/p>\n<p>The columns in the corners were often surrounded by light. This made them look thinner. To remedy this, the columns here were made 2 inches thicker.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>A Visual of Strength<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>All decorations are a symbol of strength. The <strong>metopes<\/strong> or square blocks placed between the channeled triglyphs are carved. The west metopes are depicted with Amazonomachy, a mythical battle between the Amazons and Ancient Greeks. The east metopes illustrate the mythical battle between the gods and giants called Gigantomachy. The northside shows the Trojan war, while the south represents Centauromachy, the battle between the mythical centaurs with the Lapiths.<\/p>\n<p>The pediments too provide stunning visuals. The east shows the birth of Athena, while the west is all about Poseidon versus Athena.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>cella<\/strong> or main room housed a massive <strong>chryselephantine <\/strong>statue of Athena, made from gold and ivory Parthenos, and carved by artist <strong>Phidias. <\/strong>She was fully armed with a shield, spear, and helmet. In her hand, she held Nike, the winged personification of Victory.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Backgrounder<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The<strong> Parthenon <\/strong>was converted into a Byzantine church, then a Catholic church, in the Middle Ages. Next, it made into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Greece.

Six <strong>Ergastines,<\/strong> or young aristocratic women in charge of weaving the peplos, are greeted by two priests. They all walk in procession towards the Parthenon.<\/p>\n<p>A new theory suggests it could be the depiction of the legendary Athenian king, <strong>Erechtheus<\/strong>, who sacrificed one of his daughters to save the city of Athens. An ancient wooden idol of the goddess Athena was said to have fallen from the skies during his reins. The sacrifice was under the guidance of Oracle of Delphi.<\/p>\n<p>With either theory, the mood of the artwork is sombre, as the people wear grave expressions.
