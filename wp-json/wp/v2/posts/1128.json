Materials include <strong>wood, ivory, metals, ceramic, fiber<\/strong>, and <strong>elements of nature<\/strong>. These are carved, cast, forged, modeled, woven, and combined by recognized specialists, often for knowledgeable patrons.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>In the Beginning<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Human life, which is understood to have begun in Africa, developed over millions of years, and radiated beyond the continent of Africa. The earliest African art dates to 77,000 years ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early artistic expression<\/strong> on the African continent is found in the <strong>rock art<\/strong> of the Sahara and in southern Africa. Those works <strong>depict animals<\/strong> that lived in each region, as well as <strong>human pursuits<\/strong> such as herding, combat, dance, and contact among different groups of people. It also illustrates the use of <strong>technologies<\/strong> of the time such as <strong>horses and chariots<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The now-deserts of the Sahara were once grasslands and an original source of agriculture and animal husbandry. As the desert grew, it stretched toward the still well-watered valley of the Nile and the culture of pharaonic Egypt.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art and Belief Systems<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art reveals belief systems. It presents a world that is known but not necessarily seen, predictable, or even available to everyone. These arts are expressive rather than representational and often require specialized or supernaturally ordained capabilities for their creation, use, and interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>African art is concentrated on <strong>ideas regarding beliefs and relationships that exist in the social and intellectual world.<\/strong> It is not concerned with objects of the natural or physical world.<\/p>\n<p>As in all arts, <strong>aspects of human experience<\/strong> such as origins, destinies, beliefs, physicality, power, and gender are expressed through objects and performances.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>An Expression of Social Life<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artistic expression in Africa is an <strong>integral part of social life<\/strong>. It connects daily practices to beliefs, systems of power and authority, and social networks that link people to their families, communities, and shared ancestors. African arts mark <strong>status, identity<\/strong>, and <strong>cycles of human experience<\/strong> like <strong>maturational,<\/strong> <strong>seasonal, astronomical,<\/strong> and <strong>liturgical<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Urbanization and its monumental trappings, both bureaucratic and architectural are often associated with \u201ccivilization\u201d. This takes many forms in Africa. <strong>Administrative and liturgical centers exist apart from settlement<\/strong> that is often determined by the spaces required for agriculture or herding<strong>. Seasonal climatic shifts<\/strong> and demands of political relations affect the scale and distribution of built environments and arts that mark them. The sites of Mero\u00eb, Timbuktu, Zimbabwe, Igbo Ukwu, and Kilwa Kisiwani demonstrate that range of monumentalities.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Migration<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Human migrations carried populations southward into central Africa and eventually across the Congo River Basin. The arts, major world religions, and international trade routes followed those paths and flourished in patterns of distribution seen in Africa today.<\/p>\n<p>Outsiders have often characterized, collected, and exhibited African arts as primitive, ethnographic, anonymous, and static. In reality Africa\u2019s interaction with the rest of the world led to dynamic intellectual and artistic traditions that sustain hundreds of cultures and almost as many languages. This has contributed dramatically to the corpus of human expression. African life and arts have been deeply affected by ongoing, cosmopolitan patterns of interaction with populations around the world and through time.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Creative Contribution<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Creative contributions of African life and arts are found in populations around the world. Artistic practices were conveyed by and continue to be serviced by African people and beliefs, from Macao to Manaus to Mauritania. These creative contributions are reflected in diverse art forms, from the practices of Santeria to Japanese screens and the paintings of Renaissance Venice. The literatures of Negritude and the Harlem.<\/p>\n<p>Renaissance expanded the notions of place and race to new levels that are again changing in the contemporary diaspora. Although traditional African art forms are usually described and exhibited, contemporary African arts have increased awareness and understanding of the arts of the continent across the globe.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(6) 168.

The adobe and mud buildings require periodic (and really, annual) re-plastering. If re-plastering does not occur, the structure will slowly melt in the rainy seasons. During the annual festival, the whole town contributes by re-plastering the mosque with a mud plaster made from melted butter and fine clay.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is a place of Muslim <strong>worship, prayer, contemplation<\/strong>, and <strong>community gatherings<\/strong>. It is the <strong>center of Islamic leaning and pilgrimage in West Africa<\/strong>. It was constructed by Mansa Musa, the king of the Mali empire who converted to Islam. His point was to show that African Muslims are just as devout as Arab Muslims.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The mosque overlooks the city marketplace which is held on Mondays. This shows us the intersection of commerce and religion. At the top of the three minarets are conical extensions with ostrich eggs placed at the top.

It flourished as a great center of commerce, learning, and Islam.<\/p>\n<p>In 1200 CE the original mosque was constructed by Mansa Musa. He is evidence of the royal cult of the phenomenon of ruling classes in Africa converting to Islam to gain political benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Later the rulers added surrounding towers and a wall around the complex.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, the original building fell into disrepair.<\/p>\n<p>Between 1834 \u2013 1836 a second mosque was constructed. The original was demolished because it was in disrepair, but it was also deemed too lavish in its original design.<\/p>\n<p>In 1907 after the second mosque fell into disrepair again, a third version was made. During the period of French colonialism in the late 19<sup>th<\/sup> and early 20<sup>th<\/sup> centuries, the mosque became a political symbol for residents.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(<\/strong><strong>6) 169.

It is a container of power. A specialist, who was one chosen member of the community would use this work.

The <strong>figure\u2019s belly<\/strong> was filled with <strong>bilongo <\/strong>(medicinal materials), such as herbs, plant matter, bits of animal bone, egg, fur, and seeds.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>figure\u2019s posture<\/strong> is leaning-forward and aggressive, with a partially opened mouth. It has a readiness to act or speak on behalf of individuals who call on his assistance. <strong>Hands on the hips<\/strong> show a sense of immediacy and physical power. The <strong>figure\u2019s feet<\/strong> are on blocks as an intermediary between heaven and earth.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Offerings<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Items were always connected to the desired outcome. <\/strong>Often substances were related to the dead like dirt from the cemetery for example. This would serve to bring powers of the dead under the control of the specialist.<\/p>\n<p>A person who might wish to be <strong>faster<\/strong> would take <strong>mouse fur<\/strong>, revered for speed, and put it inside. <strong>Seeds <\/strong>were inserted for a <strong>good harvest. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Claws<\/strong> could incite spirits <strong>to grasp<\/strong> something. <strong>Stones <\/strong>could activate spirits to attack. <strong>Stones from an<\/strong> <strong>ancestor\u2019s grave<\/strong> could help the relative to <strong>take on attributes<\/strong> of that ancestor.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>cowrie shell<\/strong> would seal the hole and make sure the substances stayed inside.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Kongo culture believed the <strong>mooya, <\/strong>or belly was the focal point to the soul. Thus, the belly button is the access point to the soul and to other worlds\/realms. This is after all where we are connected to our mothers.<\/p>\n<p>Community believed spirits could collectively help them and had special abilities to see potential enemies or wrongdoers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nkisi <\/strong>comes from the verb \u201ckonda\u201d (to hunt). Hunters were the most powerful. Their job was to hunt down wrongdoers. Hunters administer justice appropriate to the transgression. The power figure was an active enforcer just like hunters.<\/p>\n<p>Europeans probably first encountered these during expeditions to the Congo as early as the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century.
