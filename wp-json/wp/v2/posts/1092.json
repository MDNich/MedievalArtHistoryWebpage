Art requires participation not passive viewing.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Mayan Artists<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art was produced primarily in workshops, but certain individual artists\u2019 styles have been identified particularly Maya. Some works of art were signed. Artists were typically elite specialists and, among the Maya, the second sons of royalty.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Their Patrons and Audience<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Rulers were the major, but not the only, patrons. Audiences were both large, for calendrical rituals in plazas, and small, for gatherings of priests and nobles inside small temples atop pyramids. Some audiences were supernatural, such as the elaborate graves considered to be in the underworld.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Functional Objects as Native American Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Many Native American artworks are <strong>ritual objects to wear, carry, or use during special ceremonies<\/strong> in front of large audiences. Functionality of the object is preferred. The more active a work of art, the more it is believed to contain and transfer life force and power.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Practices<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artistic practices included <strong>workshops<\/strong>, <strong>apprentice-master<\/strong> relationships, and, less often, <strong>solitary art<\/strong> making. Some arts were a <strong>specialization by gender<\/strong> such as <strong>women weaving<\/strong> and <strong>men carving<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patrons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Patrons might be the tribal leaders, an elder, or a family member. Audiences mostly were the entire group, though some objects and performances were restricted by their sacred or political\u00a0nature.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Intellectual Pursuits<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Intellectual pursuits apparent in artistic expressions include the <strong>observation of astronomy<\/strong>, creation of <strong>poetry<\/strong>, <strong>song<\/strong>, and <strong>dance. <\/strong>The use of <strong>medicine<\/strong> for curing and divining is also included here.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 157. <em>Templo Mayor (Main Temple) <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Mexica (Aztec). 1375-1520 CE.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1112\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1112\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1112\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/157-Templo-Mayor.jpg?resize=600%2C460&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/157-Templo-Mayor.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/157-Templo-Mayor.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1112\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Templo Mayor (reconstruction drawing) \u00a9 Archives Larousse, Paris, France\/Giraudon\/The Bridgeman Art Library<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Learning Objective:<\/strong> Aztec religious complex<\/p>\n<p><strong>Themes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Place of worship<br \/>\nReligion<br \/>\nArchitecture<br \/>\nOfferings<br \/>\nPower<br \/>\nViolence<br \/>\nPassage of time<br \/>\nCeremony<br \/>\nCross-cultural<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Templo Mayor (Main Temple)<\/em><\/strong> is in<strong> Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City, Mexico). \u00a0The main temple is made from stone, <\/strong>while <strong>volcanic stone <\/strong>was used to form the<strong> Coyolxauhqui Stone. <\/strong>Meanwhile,<strong> jadeite <\/strong>was used to create the<strong> Olmec-style mask <\/strong>and <strong>basalt for the Calendar Stone.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The temple is like a ziggurat or stepped mastaba, with a double-wide staircase that leads to a plateau, and two smaller temples on top. It was expanded upon by many different rulers and continually enlarged. This has resulted in a complex system of rooms and chambers on the interior.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why was Templo Mayor Built?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Temple Mayor<\/strong> was built to honor the gods Tlaloc and Huitzilopochli. Tlaloc was the god of water, rain, agriculture, and fertility. The Aztecs created the blue and white Northern temple for this god.\u00a0 Huitzilopochli was the god of \u00a0warfare, fire, sun and sacrifice \u00a0and the Southern temple of white and red was build for this god. Together, the gods symbolized \u201cburning water\u201d which connoted warfare.<\/p>\n<p>The structure shows the Aztec belief that they could control and influence the cosmos. The spring and autumn equinox rise between the two temples. <strong>Temple Mayor<\/strong> was believed to be an axis mundi. It sat on the center of the four quadrants of the empire as a small version of the universe. It illustrated power, piety, and place of worship both daily and otherwise. It was the space where sacrifice occurred.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 1 Coyolxauhqui Stone\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1162\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1162\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1162\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/157-The-Coyolxauhqui-Stone.jpg?resize=500%2C384&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/157-The-Coyolxauhqui-Stone.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/157-The-Coyolxauhqui-Stone.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Coyolxauhqui Stone<br \/>\u00a9 Gianni Dagli Orti\/Corbis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This circular <strong>stone, carved in low relief<\/strong>, was <strong>originally painted<\/strong> and measures <strong>11 feet across<\/strong>.

It shows the authority, religiosity, and responsibility of the Aztecs to continue the cycle of time by continuing sacrifice.<\/p>\n<p>It may have been the stone Aztec priests sacrificed victims on and placed in front of Huitzilopochli\u2019s temple. In the Aztec creation story the gods called for human blood to repay the debt to the gods who sacrificed themselves to create humans. Therefore, human sacrifice was needed. The Aztecs had a cyclical world view in that time repeated and started over. The way to move forward was with sacrifice.<\/p>\n<p>In the center we see Tlaltecuhtli the devouring earth god or Tonatiuh the sun god. The god is wearing earrings. The tongue is a sacrificial blade, and the hands hold a human heart.<\/p>\n<p>Around the image is a sun shape that moves outward. The largest ray of sun points towards the cardinal directions. This is surrounded by a ring of 20 days \u2013 the basic unit of the Aztec calendar.<\/p>\n<p>The cosmos was divided into four quadrants. So was Tenochtitlan and Templo Mayor.

It was brought here and was found in <strong>Templo Mayor<\/strong>, indicating its importance.<\/p>\n<p>Art historians have a theory that it was probably worn around the neck during sacrifice and left at the temple for the gods. It was likely made by a group influenced by the Olmecs (Olmecs decline in 250 BCE or so). The Aztecs likely wanted to affiliate themselves with the Olmecs to draw a parallel between a great empire of the past (Olmecs) and a great empire now (Aztecs). This is just like how European kings constantly made associations between themselves and Roman emperors.<\/p>\n<p>Thousands of objects have been found at the <strong>Templo Mayor<\/strong>. Some offerings demonstrated the Aztec\u2019s awareness of the historical\/cultural traditions of Mesoamerica.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Originally, the city Tenochtitlan was established on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, which is now Mexico City. Between 1519-1521 it was conquered by the Spaniards. Then it was flattened to build Mexico City upon. This was completed as a sign of European supremacy. It was discovered during an excavation in Mexico City in 1978.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sacrifice<\/strong> was a major theme among Aztec religion. There was a belief was that Huitzilopochli needed energy every day to raise the sun. This required daily sacrifice and the priests would ritually eat the heart to symbolize Huitzilopochli\u2019s intake of the sacrifice. This was used for intimidation for enemies.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>(<\/strong><strong>5) 164. <em>Transformation mask.<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Kwakwaka\u2019wakw, Northwest coast of Canada.

The <strong>red <\/strong>color was linked to salmon, blood, sun, and fire, which were all considered sacred. <strong>Traditional colors also included black, white, and green.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This work was created prior to European contact and carved using hand tools and natural pigments.

The word formline was coined in 1965 to describe the Northwest Coast visual culture. <strong>Masks<\/strong>, whether opened or closed, were <strong>bilaterally symmetrical<\/strong>. Here, there is a use of <strong>undulating, calligraphic black line <\/strong>and the eyes are ovoid shapes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How was this Mask Used?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Masks were worn at <strong>potlatch <\/strong>or dance\/ceremonies, which were performed by firelight and were used for special occasions to show birth, initiation, marriage, and death. They also aided to honor or interact with ancestors or spiritual beings as a <strong>totem<\/strong> or connection.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the end of the dance<\/strong>, the mask was opened and it transforms into a different animal. During the potlatch, the dancer is transformed into the spirit represented on the mask.<\/p>\n<p>Masks were <strong>part of story telling<\/strong> and were used to re-enact myths describing human origins. Humans were animals who shed their skins and danced to reveal human form. Only men who were initiated into the tribes could wear the mask.<\/p>\n<p>Masks also were <strong>a show of social rank<\/strong> and <strong>a mark of status<\/strong> by asserting relationships with the spirit world.
