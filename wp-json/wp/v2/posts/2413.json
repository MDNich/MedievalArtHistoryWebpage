The reign of each emperor was usually brief. Rome once again regained a semblance of order under the leadership of Diocletian, who was declared emperor in 284 C.E. Diocletian wisely decided to share power with his potential rivals by establishing a <strong>tetrarchy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Constantine, one of the junior tetrarchs, disrupted the tetrarchic system by invading Italy and defeating rival tetrarch Maxentius at the battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 C.E. This allowed him to take control of the Western half of the Roman Empire.<\/p>\n<p>Constantine enacted many military, financial, administrative, and social reforms that strengthened the Western half, including the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E. This edict supported Christians in the Roman Empire, so that they no longer faced persecution. In fact, the emperor and some members of the Roman elite became the Christian church&#8217;s chief supporters and patrons. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to claim conversion to Christianity.<\/p>\n<p>There were already Christians in the 1st century C.E., but art with Christian themes did not emerge until about 190 C.E. and was created during a period of intermittent persecution. This art reflects both the beliefs of the growing Christian communities and their adaptation of existing Roman artistic styles.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2690\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Portraits-of-the-four-tetrarchs..jpg?resize=682%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Portraits-of-the-four-tetrarchs..jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Portraits-of-the-four-tetrarchs..jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Portraits-of-the-four-tetrarchs..jpg?resize=768%2C1153&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Portraits-of-the-four-tetrarchs..jpg?resize=1023%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1023w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Portraits-of-the-four-tetrarchs..jpg?w=1041&amp;ssl=1 1041w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Portraits of the four tetrarchs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2691\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Head.-Colossus-of-Constantine.-Musei-Capitolini-Rome.-Ca.-312-315-C.E..jpg?resize=695%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"505\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Head.

The icon <strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George<\/em><\/strong> from the Monastery of St. Catherine portrays Mary, the mother of God <strong>(Theotokos),<\/strong> enthroned with an infant Christ, flanked by two saints, with angels rising in the background.<\/p>\n<p>An icon like this would be displayed at a church or in smaller form at a private home. All figures are flat and frontal, wearing textured drapery and floating atop small, pointed feet and demonstrate the distinctly Byzantine style.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early or late, what\u2019s the difference?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, <strong>Early Byzantine<\/strong> is marked by the <strong>three F&#8217;s\u2014flat, frontal, and floating<\/strong>. As the period progressed, so did the portrayal of perspective and dimension. If someone is floating, you know what period they belong in.<\/p>\n<p>People soon started spreading rumors about the mystical properties of these spiritual, otherworldly icons. Some icons spoke, cried, or bled. Some were said to be <strong>acheropoietes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The Virgin of Vladimir is a middle-period Byzantine icon. She is characteristic of the Byzantine style, evident in the flat gold background, stylized but expressive face, elongated proportions, and ornamentally folded drapery.<\/p>\n<p>Some members of the clergy condemned what they saw as a violation of the second commandment, which bans the use of idols. This influenced Emperor Leo III, who was having a difficult time as Islamic armies kept defeating him. After a major volcanic eruption in 726 C.E. darkened the skies over Constantinople for days, Leo III decided that the hand of God had been withdrawn from his city because icons were being used as idols.<\/p>\n<p>Once Leo III banned icon use, he started to win battles. This began a tradition of <strong>iconoclast<\/strong> emperors. During this movement, known as <strong>iconoclasm<\/strong>, church mosaics were painted over with lime and replaced by secular or natural images. Eventually, the widowed Empress Theodora stopped iconoclasm while acting as regent for her son, Michael III, in 843 C.E.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2720\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Theotokos-between-Saints-Theodore-and-George.-1.jpg?resize=677%2C980&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"677\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Theotokos-between-Saints-Theodore-and-George.-1.jpg?w=677&amp;ssl=1 677w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Theotokos-between-Saints-Theodore-and-George.-1.jpg?resize=207%2C300&amp;ssl=1 207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Triumph of Orthodoxy<\/em><\/strong> was made in the late Byzantine Period as part of a commemorative celebration of the end of iconoclasm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mary Theotokos<\/strong> is enthroned in the center of the upper register. <strong>Empress Theodora and her young son<\/strong> take up the left. <strong>On the right<\/strong> is Patriarch Methodios, a man who had been tortured and imprisoned due to his love of icons and who had been raised to his post by Theodora herself.<\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>lower register<\/strong> are saints, some holding icons.

However, this initial resurgence of naturalistic art was then followed by increasing emphasis on elongated forms.<\/p>\n<p>One of the first things the Macedonian emperors did was repair churches mutilated by iconoclasm. In 867 C.E., a new apse mosaic was added to <strong><em>Hagia Sophia<\/em><\/strong>. It depicts a seated Mary Theotokos who doesn&#8217;t seem to be hovering entirely by herself.

The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira<\/em><\/strong> is has figural representation and is therefore <strong>not aniconic<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Art historians think that the symbolism represented in the pyxis illustrates the struggle between the Umayyads the Abasids, another Muslim group vying for power, and that it also served as an invitation to al-Mughira to gather power in hopes that he would be caliph.

This is when Constantinople was sacked by an army of the Fourth Crusade. The Latin invaders built nothing. They put up a puppet state, melting Byzantine metalwork and shipping off much of the city&#8217;s wealth.<\/p>\n<p>When Michael VIII led the restoration of the city, poorer materials were used. Frescoes were more common than mosaics. Paper replaced parchment, and bookmaking diminished. Gold was replaced by silver gilt, pewter, and ceramic\u2014even in the imperial court. Tradition and imitation of older work dominated. Extremities got even smaller and less detailed. Drapery was flat and angular.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><em>Crusaders in Constantinople<\/em><\/strong>.<\/h5>\n<p>By the 1400s, Constantinople was in ruins. Centuries of warfare had finally seen an end to the golden city.<\/p>\n<p>Following an invasion by the Ottoman Turks, Constantinople was destroyed and renamed Istanbul in 1453 C.E. Its people were scattered. Some brought the learning of the Greeks back to the West, while some went north, where Russia stood to inherit the traditions of the Orthodox church.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Lesson Summary<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Petra, a commercial city that had architectural and artistic styles that resulted from numerous external cultural influences, became a part of the Roman Empire in 106 C.E. Constantine became the emperor of Western part of the Roman Empire and issued the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E., which ceased the persecution Christians were facing at the time. Art with Christian themes began to emerge in 190 C.E. Pagans, Jews, and Christians used catacombs that were often painted or had mosaics with religious narrative. The city of Byzantium became Constantinople and was a Christian society. Its art reflected Christian imagery and narrative, Classical heritage and cultural influence from Persia and other cultures.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><strong>Medieval Art and Influence of Religion<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h4><strong>The Big Three<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are commonalities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

One of the luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the <strong>illuminated manuscript<\/strong>. The art produced by nomadic, non-Roman peoples was often portable but of high quality and is <strong>categorized with animal-style art.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Examples of <strong>metalworking and other kinds of funerary objects were found in the remains of a ship at the Sutton Hoo ship burial in Suffolk, England<\/strong>. Manuscripts from the British Isles like the <strong><em>Book of Kells, the Book of Durrow, <\/em><\/strong><em>and <strong>the Lindisfarne Gospels<\/strong><\/em> reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h5><strong>Roman Inspiration<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The term Romanesque describes architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Romanesque<\/strong> reflects certain Roman techniques, such as the <strong>barrel vault<\/strong> and the <strong>round arch<\/strong>. Several stylistic sources mark the Romanesque period:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The legacy of Roman Imperial or Late Antique\/Early Christian architecture and sculpture\u2014seen in the use of Roman style masonry vaulting, rather than wooden roofs, and the reintroduction of monumental architectural sculpture in stone.<\/li>\n<li>Continuity with the traditions of Carolingian and Ottonian art<\/li>\n<li>The influence of Byzantine and Islamic art<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>During the <strong>Romanesque<\/strong> period, the <strong>Holy Roman Empire<\/strong> included much of what is now Germany and Northern Italy. The<strong> Salian dynasty<\/strong> replaced the Ottonian dynasty in the 11th century; and the Ottonian and Early Christian influence is visible in architecture as masons began to adopt Romanesque innovations in masonry.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-528\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/58-Church-on-Sainte-Foy.jpg?resize=444%2C606&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/58-Church-on-Sainte-Foy.jpg?w=236&amp;ssl=1 236w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/58-Church-on-Sainte-Foy.jpg?resize=220%2C300&amp;ssl=1 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Church of Sainte-Foy<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>h of Sainte-Foy<\/em>.<span style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">This influence extended beyond the Holy Roman Empire.

Although it originated in France, the Gothic style spread throughout Western Europe to become the first truly International Style. The Gothic aesthetic encompassed a wide range of structures and media, including churches, palaces, and portraits.<\/p>\n<p>Gothic architecture is best defined as the &#8220;quest for height and light&#8221;, considered to be an opposing pole to the Classical Greco-Roman styles in Europe. The heart of the Gothic aesthetic was the belief that divinity could be experienced through the senses, and Gothic architecture sought to connect viewers to the heavens with high, soaring vaults; bright, multicolored lights; and echoing sounds.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2728\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Abbey-Church-of-Saint-Denis-exterior-view-of-the-west-facade.-Paris-France.-ca.-1135\u20131140-C.E..jpg?resize=468%2C624&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Abbey-Church-of-Saint-Denis-exterior-view-of-the-west-facade.-Paris-France.-ca.-1135\u20131140-C.E..jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Abbey-Church-of-Saint-Denis-exterior-view-of-the-west-facade.-Paris-France.-ca.-1135\u20131140-C.E..jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, exterior view of the west fa\u00e7ade.
