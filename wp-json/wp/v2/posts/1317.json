These images are one of a kind, and there is no way to reproduce them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Process<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The artist <strong>took a plate of silver-plated copper<\/strong> and exposed it to <strong>iodine<\/strong> to make it light sensitive. Then he <strong>exposed it to light in the camera<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, this light exposure took about eight hours. Later technology improved and ranged depending on how much light was present. The stronger the light, the less the exposure needed. For example, in the middle of the day there was ample light.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, <strong>mercury fumes<\/strong> would develop. This was stabilized with <strong>salt water<\/strong> (<strong>hypo<\/strong>)*. This step was added after they realized the plates continued to develop through being exposed to light. Many early images have simply turned black.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was experimentation only and not made for a patron. The artist wanted to make a permanent image using light and chemistry.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art or Science <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A medium of artistic expression? \u00a0A powerful scientific tool? What use could it possibly be for? It could be so easily manipulated and wasn\u2019t powerful enough yet to capture great details or small objects.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Still lifes were common<\/strong>. \u00a0This was not point and click photography! With an exposure time of up to eight hours, anything other than still lifes was difficult to take photos of. \u00a0Even sitting completely still for ten to fifteen minutes without moving was challenging.<\/p>\n<p>The earliest <strong>daguerreotypes<\/strong> were still lifes with plaster casts of antique sculpture. For practical reasons white casts reflected light well. Still lifes were immobile during long exposures.<\/p>\n<p>For <strong>symbolic reasons <\/strong>white casts lent an aura of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cclassicism\u201d to photos and helped to legitimize them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The principle of a camera had been discussed since antiquity, but it wasn\u2019t discovered until 19<sup>th<\/sup> century.

By 1829, he showed his new medium at both the Science Academy and Fine Arts Academy in Paris. Even from the start, it was unclear where photography would fit best.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of only about 25 of Daguerre\u2019s images to survive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 114. <em>Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Honor\u00e9 Daumier.

It mocks the <strong>literal and figurative elevation of art.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Daumier<\/strong> believed it would take more than just going \u201cup\u201d to elevate photography to fine art. He did not believe photography was art. This was done in response to a French court decision in 1862 that determined that photos could be considered works of art.<\/p>\n<p>This incited a large amount of mockery regarding photography.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What Do We See?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Nadar is a mad-scientist or absent-minded professor.

That means, not only is he struggling to get the perfect photo up in this blustery hot air balloon, but he also has a portable darkroom with him.<\/p>\n<p>Below, every building in Paris has \u201c<em>photographie<\/em>\u201d written on it. Not only is all of Paris apparently \u201cphoto-worthy\u201d to photographers (something that those who didn\u2019t like photography thought ridiculous), but it will literally become a popular subject for photographers.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Nadar<\/strong> was known for capturing the <strong>first aerial photographs from the basket of a hot air balloon in 1858.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Daumier\u2019s<\/strong> lithograph (and what Nadar had done in the hot air balloon) touched on a controversial subject. People felt the photo took pictures of them without their permission. Later, in 1870, the government bought Nadar\u2019s balloon for surveillance purposes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daumier\u2019s <\/strong>print captured the anxieties over the accelerated growth, industrialization, and changes regarding privacy in Paris, France, and Europe.<\/p>\n<p>There was a 19<sup>th<\/sup> century debate over whether photography could be considered \u201cart\u201d. Some people said photography was just \u201cworse painting\u201d. They said it didn\u2019t capture any of the emotion of painting. It was thought that it didn\u2019t require any skill and that you just pushed a button. \u00a0It was said to eliminate the artist altogether. Or that anyone could do it without training! \u00a0Others said it would never have a use for science.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 117. <em>The Horse in Motion<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Eadweard Muybridge.

It is <strong>one of the best methods to mass produce large editions of photographs<\/strong> that are good quality. They have a very sensual velvety feel.<\/p>\n<p>This is a study of composition, shape, rhythm, value, and line. Photography can capture abstraction in the same manner that painting can.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The artist explained:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>A round straw hat, the funnel leading out, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railings made of circular chains \u2013 white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0I stood spellbound for a while, looking and looking. Could I photograph what I felt, looking and looking and still looking? I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life. [\u2026] <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Spontaneously I raced to the main stairway of the steamer, chased down to my cabin, got my Graflex, raced back again all out of breath, wondering whether the man with the straw hat had moved or not. If he had, the picture I had seen would no longer be. The relationship of shapes as I wanted them would have been disturbed and the picture lost.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>But there was the man with the straw hat. He hadn\u2019t moved. The man with the crossed white suspenders showing his back, he too, talking to a man, hadn\u2019t moved. And the woman with a child on her lap, sitting on the floor, hadn\u2019t moved. Seemingly, no one had changed position. [\u2026] [It] would be a picture based on related shapes and on the deepest human feeling, a step in my own evolution, a spontaneous discovery.<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Stieglitz\u2019s<\/strong> function was to argue for the <strong>elevation of photography to a fine art<\/strong>. It was an argument for <strong>photography\u2019s merits. <\/strong>The <strong>emphasize was on how photography is different than painting. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Considered the first modernist photograph \u2013 why? Prior to this, photographers had tried to always emulate painting (think of <em>Still Life in Studio<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Photography\u2019s strengths are clarity and realism. This was the first photo that did not aim to emulate painting in style and subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>There was an unintended function. It became associated with Documentary Photography and journalism. It also conveyed a message about its subjects and immigrants, even though this wasn\u2019t Stieglitz\u2019s intent.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Upper and lower-class immigrants and travelers together on a boat<\/li>\n<li>Formal arrangements of diagonals, colors, tones<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Stieglitz <\/strong>ran an art gallery and published many art journals, that focused on photography<\/p>\n<p>He was familiar with the debates about immigration reform and the ghastly conditions that steerage passengers were subjected to. Interestingly, Stieglitz, the son of a German immigrant, was opposed to admitting the uneducated and marginal to the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Stieglitz\u2019s wife Emmeline and their daughter were going to France. Emmeline was from a wealthy family, and Stieglitz was very class-conscious. Here is what he had to say about it.<\/p>\n<p><em>How I hated the atmosphere of the first class on that ship. One couldn\u2019t escape the &#8216;nouveau riches.&#8217; [&#8230;] On the third day out I finally couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. I had to get away from that company. I went as far forward on the deck as I could [&#8230;]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0As I came to the end of the desk I stood alone, looking down. There were men and women and children on the lower deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading up to the upper deck of the steerage, a small deck at the bow of the steamer.\u00a0To the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage deck there was fastened a gangway bridge which was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone. On the upper deck, looking over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck. Only men were on the upper deck. The whole scene fascinated me. \u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>(4) 129. <em>The Kiss.<\/em><\/h4>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Constantin Brancusi.

Most materials came from the site or broader area.\u00a0 It is central and natural with an <strong>in situ <\/strong>stone core for the fireplace.<\/p>\n<p>The color palette is limited:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>light ochre (yellowy tan)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCherokee red\u201d based on natural rock color<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a <strong>liberal use of glass<\/strong>. The house has no walls facing the waterfall. <strong>Corner-turning windows<\/strong> do not use mullions and create unbroken views of nature. <strong>Elongated horizontal windows<\/strong> encourage the viewer to look outside.<\/p>\n<p>The architecture creates the Illusion that the stream flows through the house. The powerful falls is heard from every room.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>ceilings are low<\/strong> reaching only up to 6 feet and 4 inches. \u00a0This encourages you to move towards the windows for the feeling of openness.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>floor is polished with wax<\/strong> to give it the appearance of wetness.<\/p>\n<p>The house is darkest at the entrance and gets lighter as you move towards the back by the windows.<\/p>\n<p>The use of <strong>cantilever<\/strong> construction allowed <strong>Wright<\/strong> to hang the house over the falls. Cantilever is a long projecting beam that has reinforcing wire-mesh and steel bars embedded inside of it to increase tensile strength. He used reinforced concrete or <strong>ferroconcrete.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Edgar Kaufmann Sr, the Pittsburgh department store tycoon, commissioned <strong>Wright<\/strong> to build <strong>Fallingwater.<\/strong> Kaufmann sent a copy of <strong>Wright\u2019s<\/strong> blueprints to his personal engineer who found the ground of <strong>Fallingwater<\/strong> unstable and dimensions of the cantilever untenable. He did not recommend that <strong>Wright <\/strong>proceed with the house. The architect was upset but permitted an increase in the number and diameter of the structure\u2019s steel reinforcements.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This was created as a <strong>private home<\/strong> and weekend retreat for the Kaufmann family.<\/p>\n<p>The clients were very interested in modern art and <strong>Wright\u2019s<\/strong> work.

Examples includes the pieces like <em>Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans<\/em>. As noted above, his works often include celebrities such as movie star Elizabeth Taylor, Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones, and rock legend Elvis Presley.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>(4) 149. <em>The Bay<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Helen Frankenthaler.

Here, <strong>Frankenthaler <\/strong>poured paint onto the canvas. Then, the canvass was lifted and tilted at various angles so the paint would flow across the surface.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Action painting<\/strong> is the physical manner of applying paint, then picking up the canvas and letting the paint drip across the surface. It is a combination of the unpredictability of gravity and the artist\u2019s control.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is our physical response to color?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>We respond to colour in this painting in the same way we might respond to a sunset stained-glass window.

Dabs of color were understood to stand in for real things. It was a guitar or a hillside. The opposite is going on now. If you have bands of blue, green, and pink, the mind doesn\u2019t first think sky, grass, and flesh.
