It was based on the celebration of reason. This helped to understand the universe. Revolutionary developments in the arts, philosophy and politics occurred.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scientific inquiry<\/strong> and empirical evidence were promoted to reveal and understand the physical world. Belief in knowledge and progress led to revolutions and a new emphasis on human rights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Romanticism<\/strong> focused on emotion and individualism, while reviving medievalism. It offered a critique of<\/p>\n<p>Enlightenment principles and <strong>industrialization.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>A Proliferation of Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Artists <\/strong>assumed new roles in society.

This is an influence from David. It is as if someone has sucked all the air out of the image and it is full of precision.<\/p>\n<p>The woman is arranged <strong>parallel to the picture plane<\/strong>. She is well-lit and pushed forward. There is Interest in the line. We can follow the line made by the curve of her back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Idealization and stylization<\/strong> are part of the work. She was painted \u201cideal\u201d and sexual in Ingres\u2019 mind, but this has required an unnatural elongation and stylization of her back. He claimed while painting that \u201che couldn\u2019t stop himself\u201d with her back. In fact, one may argue there are extra vertebrae in her back.\u00a0 He believed a woman\u2019s back was the most sensual part of the body. Additionally, placed her left leg in an impossible position, all to achieve a languidness and sense of curvature.\u00a0 This reminds us of Mannerist elongation. Mannerism was Ingres\u2019 favorite style.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Compositionally<\/strong>, she is very large and touches nearly all four edges. This is a voluptuous and sensuous expression of the body. It was idealized to be erotic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Color Evoking Emotion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>She is icy, aloof, and has a distant look in her eye.\u00a0 Use of blues makes the image cool with an association with the Middle East (lapis lazuli). Only warm spots are on her back and fan.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Romantic Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was commissioned by Caroline Murat, Napoleon\u2019s sister, and Queen of Naples. She was interested in the Middle East, due to Naples\u2019 trade connections with that area. The painting was an experiment with new Romantic ideas using exoticism and eroticism.<\/p>\n<p>It examines a reclining female nude in a new context that is no longer mythological, but real and exotic. The work also celebrates French imperialism, while objectifying the fetishize of the Orient. The French had a sexual and cultural fascination with this region.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Scandal<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was shown in the Salon of 1819, and it caused a scandal. Viewers were surprised by the frank gaze and sensuality of the nude. This exotic context was new and shocking. There was no way to connect this woman to Venus. Also, the elongation of the body struck viewers as odd.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content: Romantic<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Romantic content has <strong>P.I.N.E<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong> is for <strong>Past <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>I <\/strong>is for <strong>Irrationality\/Insanity<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>N<\/strong> is for <strong>Nature<\/strong>,<\/li>\n<li><strong>E<\/strong> is for <strong>Erotic\/Exotic<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Life in a Harem <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work depicts an odalisque. This is a woman in a harem, as a concubine, companion, and source of entertainment. Ingres had never been in a harem. This was a western\/French fantasy of what a harem would be.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, this is completely inaccurate. The woman in the portrait is a white-washed version of an Oriental woman.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Reclining Female Nude<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work plays into the tradition of the reclining female nude&#8212;going back to Titian. The previous nudes were all said to be Venus, or they could at least be interpreted as Venus.<\/p>\n<p>With Ingres\u2019 <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,<\/em><\/strong> there is no way to interpret her as a Venus \u2013 she is a harem girl. This is <strong>not in a classical setting<\/strong>. This is exotic and <strong>Oriental<\/strong> which at time was commonly used to refer to <strong>Near East and North Africa<\/strong>, not the Far East. Look at the peacock fan, turban, enormous pearls and hookah, a pipe for opium.<\/p>\n<p>Her body is shocking to the viewer. This is not Venus but a girl whose occupation is sex. She isn\u2019t an ideal, imaginary goddess, but she is a real woman! She gazes directly at us. Her body is bizarrely elongated, seemingly rejecting all classical idealization.<\/p>\n<p>Her body is made acceptable to French culture for two reasons. Ingres turns her over and away from the viewer. She is not as pornographic as she could have been. Also, she is geographically distant not a European woman. This is what makes her exotic instead of scandalous.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Orientalism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Orientalism was an interest in the Orient (Middle East and Asia) because of colonialism. France was a huge colonial power. The interest in non-western cultures was growing. This fascination with other cultures was paired with the belief that the French were civilized and superior.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>About Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1864) <\/strong>\u00a0was a student of David. He absorbed his teacher\u2019s Neoclassical vision but reinterpreted it. Ingres won the Prix de Rome and lived in Italy from 1806 \u2013 24. In 1814, he traveled to Naples where he was employed by Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, and Napoleon\u2019s sister. Naples, because of its proximity to the Middle East and its connections with trade, was interested in Orientalism and exoticism.<\/p>\n<p>The artist returned to serve as the French Academy\u2019s director, in Rome, from 1835 \u2013 1841<\/p>\n<p>When Ingres painted <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,<\/em><\/strong> he had started to reject neoclassical subject matter as too stuffy, dull, and arrogant in its moral instruction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(<\/strong>4) 100. <strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery<\/em><\/strong><em>. <\/em><\/h4>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em>Joseph Wright of Derby.

He was known for depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods. The artist belonged to a scientific group called the Lunar Society of Birmingham.

These were spaces for men to be with their mistresses. Upon arrival, the gentleman asked Doyen if he would paint his mistress on a swing that a bishop would push. The gentleman would be placed in such a way that he would be able to see up the skirt of his mistress.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Doyen declined by saying \u201cwell\u2026thank you for thinking of me but I don\u2019t really paint things like this. However, I know someone who does, and his name is Fragonard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This painting was the result!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It has been speculated that the patron may have been Baron de Saint-Julien.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Fun and Frivolity<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work celebrates the leisure of the upper class. It was painted to be erotically tantalizing. It was meant to represent a game. Gardens are for play. The couple is playing a game. We are playing the game by interpreting the painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Upon Closer Inspection<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There is a lot going on in this work, which makes it an <strong>intrigue painting. <\/strong>A scene of scandal, playfulness, and flirtation, suggests a secret love affair. The patron\/lover in the lower left is looking up the skirt at the young lady who swings while a Bishop pushes her. This could be a possible comment on the corruption of the church.<\/p>\n<p>The garden is fertile, abundant, growing out of control.\u00a0 This is based on an <strong>English garden<\/strong>, with controlled and constructed outdoor spaces. It has the appearance of being wild and natural, despite still being planned and arranged. Here the figures seem to be in a private park, hidden away.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Iconographic interpretation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Swinging<\/strong> is an association with fickleness and female inconstancy. It is in reference to the act of lovemaking, but swinging is also a reference to a cheating lover.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>barking dog<\/strong> might be alluding us to the fact that the scene should be quiet and calm.\u00a0 The dog does not symbolize fidelity here, rather impatience, carnal desire, animalistic urges, and arousal.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>pink roses<\/strong> are a symbol of female genitalia, as is the <strong>pink dress<\/strong> and shape of the opening.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shoe coming off<\/strong> is a common indication of lost virginity and one who has succumbed to passion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Man\u2019s hat off <\/strong>at the end of a long slim arm<strong>,<\/strong> is a symbol of an erection.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>man is embedded in a rose bush<\/strong> as a symbol of sex.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rake on the ground<\/strong> is similar to a crass term for male genitalia in French.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>shushing cupid<\/strong> is based on a statue that was in Madame de Pompadour\u2019s home (a famous woman known for love) and heightens the illicit nature of the scene.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dolphins <\/strong>are a reference to Venus because she was pulled to the shore by dolphins. <strong>Putti <\/strong>is Cupid\u2019s friends sitting on top of the dolphin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The garden<\/strong> is fertile, abundant, and wild with unbridled passion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Leisure of the French Aristocracy<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Indulgences<\/strong> that characterized the French aristocracy before the Revolution included the pursuit of pleasure, and playfulness. Games were very popular. This calls attention to the amount of leisure time they had. Games were also symbols of the poor. It was trendy to \u201cplay\u201d poor and simple, like farm girls and peasant boys.<\/p>\n<p>The strict rules of conduct were loosened in these societal situations. Additionally, by participating in these activities, aristocrats believed they received health benefits or relaxation, while stimulating both their senses and intellect. This combated boredom!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Public parks<\/strong> and <strong>private gardens<\/strong> were increasingly popular. These were places where flirtatious physical interactions were allowed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Aristocrats, Status and Art <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artistic renderings of aristocrats playing and being frivolous were very popular. Showcasing such works was a sign of status. By definition, aristocrats did not have jobs. They existed to express their status.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a new element of freedom. After the French Revolution and the death of Louis XIV the aristocrats who had previously lived in the rigid ceremonial world of the king, were now free to celebrate themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(<\/strong><strong>4) 102.

It is about a conflict between the Romans and rivals in the nearby Alba. The warring had reached a stalemate. To prevent further deaths, three combatants from both sides pledged to fight on behalf of the cities. The Romans selects the three Horatii brothers while the Albans choose the three Curatii brothers.<\/p>\n<p>One of the women on the right is a Horatii engaged to marry a Curatii.

He was able to go to Rome for five years, and study art&#8212; all expenses paid!<\/p>\n<p>After returning, his work was severely undecorated, anti-Rococo, extolled virtues of stoicism, masculinity, patriotism and honor. This was the reaction against the femininity, vanity, lasciviousness, and pleasure pursuing of Rococo.<\/p>\n<p>He exhibited this in at the Salon of 1785 and people were amazed.

This was the year Washington gave his farewell address.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This shows George Washington as a public servant.

(Congress approved this in 1782)<\/p>\n<p>He does not hold <strong>his officer\u2019s sword<\/strong>, it hangs on the outside of the fasces, just outside his reach. This signifies he can be strong but should not immediately resort to this.<\/p>\n<p>He is a private citizen. A plow rests behind Washington and reminds us that he is a simple man tied to the earth. This refers to the story of the Roman dictator Cincinnatus, who resigned when his leadership, so he could return to his farm (rather than Caesar who created absolute power for himself). This parallel shows how Washington turned down the office and stepped away from the Presidency.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>walking stick<\/strong> symbolizes that Washington was well-known as a man who loved to stroll his estate.

She was in danger as a well-known royalist. She painted it for the Uffizi Gallery in Florence as an addition to their collection of well-known artists\u2019 self-portraits. This put her in league with male painters.<\/p>\n<p>She was able to occupy in a non-threatening manner both worlds&#8211;the world of artists, dominated by men, and the world of femininity.\u00a0 She shows she can paint just as well as men, and is even friendly with royalty. But, she is not a threat because of her great femininity. She is pretty, demure, soft, gentle, and sophisticated.<\/p>\n<p>Female artists had to traverse a very fine line of showing their talent to be equal to a man but consoling men and calming them by reminding them that their genders were quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Critics called the artist vain and self-important.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun<\/strong> was 35 when this was painted. She is looking at the viewer as she paints a portrait of Marie Antoinette. She was Queen Marie Antoinette\u2019s official court painter and personal friend.<\/p>\n<p>In the painting she sits in a relaxed pose at her easel. She looks very pretty. Her skin looks soft, with rosy cheeks, gentle curls, piercing eyes, and flowing silk. She wears a white turban and dark dress with a soft white ruffled collar \u2013 in the free-flowing Grecian style. This was inspired by the style that Marie-Antoinette had made popular at the French court. Certainly, not an outfit a painter would paint in. Yet, the brushes are ready along with a palette.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In 1783, <strong>Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun<\/strong>, who specialized in portraiture, was admitted to the French Royal Academy, as the first female member. \u00a0Her entrance however was orchestrated by her most important patron&#8211; Marie Antoinette! Now, she certainly deserved to be there, but to many men, it looked like one corrupt woman pulling strings for another woman.<\/p>\n<p>Marie Antoinette was deeply disliked at this point in France. Many artists and writers argued that it was Rococo, and by extension women in general, who were leading France down the road to decay.<\/p>\n<p>Marie Antoinette, the Rococo excesses, indeed femininity in general, was criticized for having made France and men effeminate. This was blamed for all of France\u2019s problems (debt, corruption, a weak Louis XVI, and a deeply disliked Marie Antoinette). Many believed the only way to end this was revolution.<\/p>\n<p>When the French Revolution occurred, <strong>Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun<\/strong>, had to flee and escape. This work was created soon after her departure from France.<\/p>\n<p>The artist ended up traveling to Italy and Russia to paint nobility and royalty. She was enormously famous in her life and ended up writing an autobiography.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 99. <em>Portrait of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Miguel Cabrera.

It seemed like it was trying to be a history painting, but this was <strong>not an appropriate subject<\/strong> because it was too modern. Even though one could argue the Marie de\u2019 Medici series was a \u201cmodern history painting,\u201d these had been painted in the Grand Manner, and these figures were gritty, unglamorous, and dead!<\/p>\n<p>The realism of the dead and dirty bodies, combined with the figures\u2019 distance from academic models provoked harsh criticism. Critics said Liberty looked like a prostitute and insurgents looked like criminals.<\/p>\n<p>The French government bought this to remind Louis-Philippe of how he came to power. After the 1848 Revolution, when Louis-Philippe was overthrown, it was taken down for being too inflammatory and kept out of view. Paris was concerned about inciting yet another violent revolution.<\/p>\n<p>The work was moved to the Louvre to exhibit in 1863.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People <\/em><\/strong>depicts the <strong>July Revolution of 1830<\/strong>. It uses the conventions of a history painting, but it was painted this the same year the event happened.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marianne <\/strong>is represented as an <strong>allegory<\/strong> or a human who represents a moral or political idea. Here, the idea is Liberty. Here, she wears the Phrygian cap, a classical signifier of freedom from ancient Rome for freed slaves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Delacroix<\/strong> was inspired by Michelangelo\u2019s nudes for the figure of Liberty. Marianne is monumental, and nude to the waist, in reference to classical nudes.\u00a0 He painted her in yellow to allude to that classical nudity. Vibrant, rebellious, victorious, and fiery, she represents the will of the people. She holds a bayonetted musket in one hand and the tricolor flag in the other.<\/p>\n<p>Men around her represent the different types of people who participate in the revolution. We see that all classes are united in this revolution<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gavroche <\/strong>is a symbol of youthful revolt against injustice. He is based on the character of Gavroche in Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Mis (Hugo and Delacroix were friends). Wearing a black velvet beret, worn by students, he has a cartridge pouch slung across his shoulder. There is a war cry on his lips, urging others to fight, while brandishing a weapon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bourgeoisie<\/strong> is the kneeling figure with a top hat that may be based on Delacroix himself. Notice the loose-fitting trousers and elegantly tailored jacket. This represents that the revolution is for the affluent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A worker<\/strong> wears and apron, shirt, and sailor\u2019s trousers. From his dirty body, we can see he is a laborer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ground<\/strong> is littered with the dead. One figure lacks pants.

The stipulation was that the new structure had to be in one of two historical, or what were called Revivalist styles: Neo-Elizabethan (Shakespearean times) or Neo-Gothic. Industrialization unsettled people as modernity seemed ugly. When they looked to the past, it seemed beautiful and traditional. Both were styles associated with the pre-Industrial era and English ingenuity and craftsmanship, even though Gothic wasn\u2019t English, it was adopted in England.<\/p>\n<p>Neoclassicism was popular but was associated with revolution and republicanism. These were associations which Britain did not want to have, as it is one of a few European countries that did not have a revolution in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>There were 97 entries that included 91 in Gothic and 6 in Elizabethan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Charles Barry<\/strong>, famous English architect, won the competition.

It is not meant to be heroic. This is an account of abuse and deprivation and exploitation. It challenged traditions of academic painting and asked, \u201cWhy are the wealthy the only appropriate subjects?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There was no commissioner. The art world was moving away from a clear patron or desire. Now, the art market had developed. There was an ample market for works that artists decided to create.<\/p>\n<p>This work was rejected at the 1855 Salon as \u201cinappropriate\u201d. The reaction to the work was disgust. Never had mundane activities and peasants been represented in art, unless ennobled and honorably working the land.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Courbet\u2019s comment on the painting:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I stopped to consider two men breaking stones on the highway. It\u2019s rare to meet the most complete expression of poverty, so an idea of a picture came to me on the spot. I made an appointment with them at my studio for the next day. On one side is an old man of seventy, bent over his work, his sledgehammer raised, his skin parched by the sun, his head shaded by a straw hat; his trousers, of course material, are completely patched; and in his cracked sabots you can see his bare heels sticking out of socks that were once blue. On the other side is a young man with swarthy skin, his head covered with dusk; his disgusting shirt all in tatters reveals his arms and parts of his back; a leather suspender holds up what is left of his trousers, and his mud-caked leather boots show gaping holes on every side. The old man is kneeling, the young man standing behind him energetically carrying a basket of broken rocks. Alas, in labor such as this, one\u2019s life begins and ends this way.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We see two figures work on the side of the road. They are stone breakers who are in charge of breaking up stones and clearing rubble so the roads can be made. This work was the results of industrialization<\/p>\n<p>They are dirty, dressed in ripped and tattered clothing. We do not see faces and though they work together, they do not communicate. Not only are they isolated from us, but they are also isolated from each other. The figures are that of a boy (too young for this kind of labor) and an older man (too old for this kind of labor).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Set in front of a low hill, it looks like the town of Ornans, where <strong>Courbet<\/strong> lived. The hill reaches the entire top of the canvas except for a small spot on the far-right corner. This effectively isolates the laborers and makes us feel they are trapped. Their entrapment is not only physical (in this painting) but also social and financial.<\/p>\n<p>Even though we know that the space between them and the hill is very deep, the colors and lack of sky make the painting seem flat and almost claustrophobic<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was destroyed in the WWII British Bombing of Dresden, in 1945. It was in a transport vehicle, with about 150 other paintings to a castle for safekeeping when it was bombed. Painted only one year after Karl Marx wrote <em>The Communist Manifesto<\/em> which impacted <strong>Courbet.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Industrial Revolution across Europe led to a two-class system, the Bourgeoisie who were factory owners and the upper class, and proletariat or working class.<\/p>\n<p>The message is that the Proletariat was exploited. They must unite and overcome the bourgeoisie to create the perfect classless society. Marx advocated for a violent revolution if necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Courbet<\/strong> turned away from his wealthy bourgeoisie upbringing to adopt a self-imposed vagrancy and Bohemian lifestyle. This was unconventional with few ties. It was based on art, music, poetry, and free love.\u00a0 Think of Bohemians as the hippies of 19<sup>th<\/sup> century Paris.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Courbet<\/strong> did not attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was not a formal member. This marks the end of the Ecole\u2019s influence over artists.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Courbet<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>French born artist <strong>Gustave Courbet (1819-1879) <\/strong>was instrumental in the emergence of Realism. Rejecting the French Academy and classical styles, his work focused on what was real. Think the working class and people living in the countryside.

This changed tradition. The artists who used this method to paint thought they should paint what they see and not bring items back to the studio. They brought soft aluminium tubes of paint with them. These were painted on small canvas, without the pretense of trying to be like history paintings. All materials were easily transported.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monet<\/strong> focused on capturing the essence of what he saw, rather than capturing formal clarity. The focus is on light, color, and atmosphere. Some areas are almost completely abstract, with loose, gestural, painterly brushstrokes. There is no sense of traditional modelling. This focuses on the play of light and color.<\/p>\n<p>The hardness of lines is dissolved by the light. He used rapid, swift brushstrokes to create transience of smoke and conveys speed. Light is filtered through the smoke and metal grid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is this that different compositionally from a traditional landscape?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual movement going back in space<\/li>\n<li>Framing devices on either side<\/li>\n<li>Lines that recede and carry our eyes back<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Modern critics had urged painters to \u201c<strong>paint their own times<\/strong>\u201d. \u00a0A wide variety of subject matter suddenly became acceptable (and even encouraged) when previously this subject matter would have been inappropriate and unthinkable for painting.<\/p>\n<p>Charles Baudelaire had urged artists to be \u201cpainters of modern life\u201d. A painter\u2019s goal was to capture the very nature of modernity, distilling something essential from its transitory, busy qualities. The traditional Academy challenged this. Why paint what was viewed as ugly and unattractive? It was a radical idea to paint real life, but it was an emblem of modernity.<\/p>\n<p>A train is a <strong>symbol of modern life<\/strong>, which was perfect for Impressionist goals.<\/p>\n<p>Novelist Emile Zola said: \u201cYou can hear the trains rumbling in, see the smoke billow up under the huge roofs . . . That is where painting is today . . . Our artists have to find the poetry in the train stations, the way their fathers found poetry in forests and rivers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A Series of 12 works were difficult to sell, however, as many buyers were not caught up with Impressionist ideas. Impressionists were not very popular in their lifetimes. This bothered many of them, especially Renoir. The term <strong>\u201cImpressionist\u201d<\/strong> was coined to be derogatory. It was used as a way of saying the artists couldn\u2019t paint. They could only make impressions.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Interior of Saint-Lazare station<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Train that is moving into the station under giant metal hanger<\/li>\n<li>Grittiness and dirtiness of the coal-burning steam engines<\/li>\n<li>Noise of trains coming in, people getting off, squeal of brakes, whistle of trains and conductors\n<ul>\n<li>Canopy of glass and steel; frames activities on platform<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Block of residential buildings with uniform rooflines, standardized fenestration (arrangement of windows\/doors on an elevation), and strong horizontal banding\n<ul>\n<li>Typical of Haussmann\u2019s architecture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Pont de l\u2019Europe in background \u2013 a large, star-shaped iron bridge.<\/li>\n<li>Connection between energy\/hustle + bustle of people, with the energy and power of modernization and technology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Context <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Monet rented a flat near the <strong>Saint Lazare Station<\/strong> in 1877 and asked to paint the station. In the spring of that year, he exhibited seven of these canvasses.\u00a0 Having previously lived in Argenteuil, a Parisian suburb, <strong>Monet<\/strong> knew the phenomenon of commuter railroads. It was a very modern idea, that people would travel to work in the city. He viewed the changes in Paris very positively at this time.<\/p>\n<p>By 1877, Paris had been transformed through industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancements (Haussmannization of Paris).<\/p>\n<p>Under the direction of Baron Haussmann, prefect for Napoleon III, Haussmann was asked to achieve many things.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modernize boulevards to both widen and lengthen them.<\/li>\n<li>Build new facades on existing apartments and build new buildings (fenestration \u2013 arrangement of doors, windows on an elevation; use uniform rooflines)<\/li>\n<li>Build bridges to allow commuters to pass more easily over Paris\u2019s Seine and surrounding rivers<\/li>\n<li>Build new train stations to facilitate travel in and out of city, while increasing the size of existing ones. Saint Lazare is tripled in size.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This led to an <strong>increase of commuters and encouraged tourism<\/strong> around the city. An expanding middle class could support this leisure time and they had the money. Trains became faster, and more times were offered for travelers.<\/p>\n<h5>About Monet<\/h5>\n<p>French Impressionist <strong>Claude Monet (1840-1926)<\/strong> might be best remembered for soft pastel shades, of his serenely beautiful garden and lily pond, at his countryside home in Giverny, France. Other series of works include haystacks (1891), poplars (1892) and Rouen Cathedral (1894).<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 118. <em>The Valley of Mexico from the Hillside of Santa Isabel<\/em>.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Jose Mar\u00eda Velasco.

Although<strong> Van Gogh<\/strong> thought they were close friends, Gauguin denied feeling close to <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> at all and doesn\u2019t want a partnership.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> cut off his ear and delivered his ear to a prostitute. Later, he asked what had happened to him, as he had no recollection.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> was hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, in Saint-Remy, in southern France, a clinic for the mentally ill. During his convalescence here, <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> was encouraged to paint by his brother Theo. The artist often chewed his paint brushes. Paint was made with led, which could cause difficulty focusing and halos in front of the eyes. This is caused by lead-induced enlargement of retina.<\/p>\n<p>He was medicated with a plant called the foxglove. If given too much of the drug, it causes patients to experience yellow too intensely.<\/p>\n<p>While staying in Saint Remy hospital in southern France, he was able to spend hours contemplating the stars without interference from gas or electric city streetlights. He had never seen the night sky like this.<\/p>\n<p>In 1890, <strong>Van Gogh<\/strong> shot himself in the chest, while standing in a wheat field. \u00a0There were no witnesses and he died there two days later.

He had a wife and five children.\u00a0 After his career as a stockbroker failed in the early 1880s, he took on painting more seriously. He went to work with Van Gogh for 9 weeks \u2013 we know how that turned out!<\/p>\n<p>He had cardiovascular syphilis and when left untreated, will spread to the heart and veins. Syphilitic sores on legs were often mistaken for eczema and treated with\u2026arsenic!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gauguin<\/strong> made his first visit to Tahiti in March 1891. He returned to Paris in 1893. He then abandoned his family and wanted to leave behind all that was \u201cartificial\u201d.\u00a0 He complained that Tahiti was not as exotic as he expected. As a French colony, he said it had already been destroyed by missionaries and disease. Yet, he was swept up in the exoticism of what he did see.<\/p>\n<p>When he was 50 years old, he married a 13-year-old Tahitian girl. She became pregnant almost immediately. At the same time, he married two other 14-year-olds! He gave all three girls syphilis. He named his Tahitian home the \u201cHouse of Orgasm\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gaugin <\/strong>painted this canvas in 1897. Just after learning of the death of his daughter Aline, he decided to climb up into the mountains, paint this canvas, and then kill himself afterwards.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While he may or may not have attempted suicide, he certainly realized that saying this would make a good story. \u201cI painted this planning on committing suicide afterwards, and then decided not to because this painting made me want to live again.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gauguin was extremely self-conscious of his image<\/strong> as a bohemian vanguard artist and concerned with self-promotion.<\/p>\n<p>A few months after completing this, <strong>Gauguin<\/strong> sent it to Paris along with several other of his works, insisting they be exhibited altogether in a gallery. He sent his friends careful instructions about how they should be framed and who should be invited to the exhibition. These facts show that his awareness of the Parisian art market and how his art would be received was of utmost importance even as he supposedly renounced this society by living on a tropical island on the other side of the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Gaugin was hugely important in art history for beginning the path towards expressionistic color and (unfortunately) primitivism.

An image is carved or <strong>incised <\/strong>into the surface of the wax using a <strong>burin. <\/strong>Incise lines directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus while pressing down hard. This results in uneven, jagged lines where shavings curl up on either side and makes ridges. Rather than blowing or wiping those shavings off, they are left to give extra texture to the printing. This reveals the plate underneath. The printing part is cut into, while the non-printing parts are left uncut.<\/p>\n<p>The plate is put into acid. The acid eats away at the exposed metal parts, leaving holes. The plate is heated so all the wax melts off. The surface of sheet is covered with ink, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. It will be wiped away from the rest of the plate. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Aquatint?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A layer (or more) of <strong>powdery resin<\/strong> is applied to the plate. The plate is heated so it melts. Then it is cooled to create a hardened, fine, but still grainy pattern.\u00a0 The plate is placed in acid which eats away around the powdered resin, leaving small indentations in the plate.<\/p>\n<p>The plate is rinsed, and then ink is applied, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Different <strong>tints and hues of a color can be controlled<\/strong> by how much resin is on the plate and how long the plate was in acid.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influence from Japanese Prints<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Spare composition<\/li>\n<li>Tilted perspective; love of flat patterning; rejects Western assumption of 3D space<\/li>\n<li>Simplicity of line and form<\/li>\n<li>See figures from multiple angles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Repetition and Contrast of Form<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Note <strong>the curve<\/strong> of the woman\u2019s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Limited Color Palette<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The palette consists of only four colors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rose<\/li>\n<li>white<\/li>\n<li>brown<\/li>\n<li>cream<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This enables us to focus on line and clarity. From an artistic point of view, <strong>Cassatt<\/strong> was trying to imitate the haziness and softness of Impressionist form.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Notes<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Asymmetrical composition<\/li>\n<li>Spatial flattening<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is <strong>Mary Cassatt\u2019s<\/strong> exercise in <strong>Japanese techniques. <\/strong>It is based on <strong>ukiyo-e prints.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a de-eroticization of women, showing a boudoir\/toilette scene that is not sexualized. This is likely because of the gender of the artist. This is a twist on the traditional female nude that we have been seeing in art history.<\/p>\n<p>It captures fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are <strong>two cultural influences<\/strong>. While the work is Japanese in form (mostly), it is (mostly) Impressionist in content. \u00a0This was inspired by a woodblock print (in Cassatt\u2019s personal collection) of the daughter of a prosperous Japanese Edo businessman. Toilette\/boudoir scenes have their art historical roots in Old Master paintings. Think Odalisque, reclining Venuses, toilette scenes, and women bathing for example.<\/p>\n<p>This is a private moment of a woman adjusting her hair. <strong><em>The Coiffure <\/em><\/strong>means \u201cHairdo\u201d in French.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>ritual of getting dressed<\/strong> for the day had a great deal to do with status, based on royal rituals with Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette. To wear elaborate hairstyles, one needed a maid. Yet, the woman here is tending to her hair alone. We see a working woman. This can be a comparison between the historically elite nature of the event vs. the everyday normalcy of this woman.<\/p>\n<p>There is a <strong>voyeuristic element<\/strong>, but the body is not sexualized. Though her breasts are exposed, her chest and the details of her body are otherwise muted. No anatomical accuracy or detail is given.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The was a wave of <strong>Japonisme<\/strong> spreading across Europe. In 1854, US Naval commodore Matthew Perry forcibly opened Japan to Western trade. Japanese goods flooded into Europe for the first time since the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century. Lacquers, fans, bronzes, hanging scrolls, kimonos, ceramics, illustrated books, and ukiyo-e prints were all popular. This inspired a Japanese style across Western art.<\/p>\n<p>In 1890, Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris showcased an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints. <strong>Mary Cassatt<\/strong> was in the audience and was absolutely taken with these prints.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Mary Cassatt<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Mary Cassatt (1844-1925)<\/strong> was born to a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She studied art in Europe and settled in Paris after befriending Degas. She regularly showed artwork with the Impressionists.<\/p>\n<p>Cassatt rarely made nudes. Most often, she depicted her friends and family members with their children.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(<\/strong><strong>4) 122. <em>The Scream<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Edvard Munch.

We would expect the sky to be blue and the land to be orange, but he has swapped this. The high horizon line lets us see more of the landscape than sky.<\/p>\n<p>The strict linearity on the left contrasts with the curves and rounded shapes on the right. The foreground and background blend into one another. Wide curves of the figure are repeated in the landscape, and it literally ripples through or affects the man\u2019s body.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is part of Munch\u2019s semi-autobiographical cycle \u201cThe Frieze of Life\u201d, painting not what he saw, but what he felt. It shows internal emotion through external form. This is Munch\u2019s feelings\/experience of <strong>synesthesia<\/strong> or the union of senses. It\u2019s a visual depiction of sound and emotion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask yourself:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How does one convey experiences that are not visual?<\/p>\n<p>How does one convey sensations that we experience with more than one sense?<\/p>\n<p>Can art be used to depict sound, perception, anxiety?<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The theme of this work is <strong>death, dread, and anxiety<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Three main areas illustrate this.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>bridge<\/strong> extends at a steep angle from the middle distance at left to fill the foreground<\/p>\n<p><strong>Human figures<\/strong> also display this. A <strong>screaming figure<\/strong> in the foreground, is linked to the landscape, as both are made of curves. One feels the cry of nature, a sound that is sensed rather than heard. The figure\u2019s face resembles a Peruvian mummy that was exhibited at the World\u2019s Fair in Paris in 1889. Many artists were inspired by this.<\/p>\n<p>There are <strong>two rigid figures<\/strong> on the back of the bridge. Are they coming or going?<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>landscape<\/strong> also represents the theme. The shoreline, lake, hills, and churning sky are reflected on the water.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Symbolism?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Symbolism<\/strong> expresses emotion and ideas. It ignores naturalism. Symbolist artists came from diverse international backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not the chair which should be painted, but the human\u2019s relation to it\u201d. In other words, it expresses emotion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Decline of the Traditional Art School<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This was a <strong>Norwegian artist<\/strong>. The art world was expanding. One no longer had to be French, Italian, or Dutch. Therefore, traditional art schools were declining in their power and necessity in the art world.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influences on the Work<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Both his mother and sister died when Munch was a child. The artist was ill, depressed much of his life and suffered from synaesthesia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Passage in his diary dated January 22<sup>nd<\/sup>, 1892, written in Nice, France likely is the inspiration for this piece.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>I was walking along the road with two friends.

You will see a co-existence of <strong>multiple viewpoints in a single scene. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Are the views here always possible?<\/p>\n<p>How can we see so many parts of the mountain flattened towards us?<\/p>\n<p>How can we see the tops and sides of trees at the same time?<\/p>\n<p>There are <strong>three horizontal bands in the composition<\/strong>. The band closest to us has foliage and houses. Rough patches of <strong>yellow, emerald, and green<\/strong> suggest a wide plain. <strong>Blues, violets, and grays<\/strong> form the mountain surrounded by sky. This alludes to atmospheric perspective through the bluish gray of the background. With its <strong>sketchy outlines <\/strong>this was not considered \u201cfinished\u201d by academic standards of the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>C\u00e9zanne<\/strong>\u00a0used <strong>blocks of color<\/strong> to create forms and <strong>evenly distributed lighting. <\/strong>Our viewpoint is elevated, though we do not see how. Presumably, we are on another mountain. This in conjunction with the high horizon line allows us to see more of the valley.<\/p>\n<p>A complicated pattern of diagonals can be found in each of the roofs, lines of the mountain, and arrangement of patches on the plain. This creates a deep, unified space that our eye can travel in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flatness coexists with depth. <\/strong>Somehow, he has flattened everything by making forms using rectangular swabs of paint. Yet, we understand the illusion. Things recede backwards.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is yet <strong>another study on this mountain and valley<\/strong>. It occupied an important part of <strong>C\u00e9zanne<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>oeuvre.\u00a0 <strong><em>Mont Sainte-Victoire <\/em><\/strong>poses a central question. \u00a0Can you use flat, unmodeled color to create the illusion of depth?<\/p>\n<p>Can you explore coexisting views while flattening? In other words, when we flatten something, inherently we understand that to mean that we can only see one side. However, <strong>C\u00e9zanne<\/strong>\u00a0thinks. \u201cCan I flatten things and still create the illusion of showing more than one flat side of this object?\u201d<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are three segments:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foliage\/houses<\/li>\n<li>An expansive plain<\/li>\n<li>Craggy mountain and sky<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a <strong>sense of stillness<\/strong> across the landscape. Note the absence of human activity. We see human presence though. The subject was not chosen for historical interest or picturesque qualities. <strong>C\u00e9zanne\u2019s<\/strong> principal interest was to explore the formal properties of his surroundings. For example, the huge iron cross that was on Mont Sainte-Victoire, never showed up in any paintings that he did of this scene.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Location<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mont Sainte-Victoire dominates the skyline of <strong>Aix-en-Provence, the hometown of<\/strong> <strong>C\u00e9zanne<\/strong>. The mountain\u2019s name means Mountain of Holy Victory. It is associated with a celebrated victory of Provence\u2019s ancient Roman inhabitants against an invading army.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Paul C\u00e9zanne<\/strong> (1839- ) was born in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. He developed artistic skills at an early age. Today, the artist is considered the father of modern art and a proto-cubist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>C\u00e9zanne<\/strong>\u00a0would return to this mountain more than 60 times in his career. Each time he painted it differently than the time before. He constantly tried multiple angles and points of views.<\/p>\n<p><strong> C\u00e9zanne <\/strong>bought an acre of land on this hill in 1901 and built a studio on it.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, within the artworld, <strong>C\u00e9zanne<\/strong>\u00a0took Impressionism to its logical next step. What happens when you apply the loose, gestural brushstroke approach to everything, not just scenes of the Parisian bourgeois class? This is what <strong>Post-Impressionism<\/strong> does. It further pursues the Impressionist mission with simplified color, and broken lines and forms. It reacts against the naturalism of Impressionists<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 126. <em>Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon.<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em>Pablo Picasso.

This work fully explores abstraction and marks a radical break from traditional composition and perspective in painting.<\/p>\n<p>The space comes towards us in jagged shards. The <strong>figures are aggressively abstracted<\/strong> into sharp geometric forms. The limbs seem at times dislocated. The figures do not have rounded volume, instead, they are splintered. There is no modeling as that would have created the illusion of roundness. The space is radically compressed and flattened, like a still life.<\/p>\n<p>Do not let the rough painting and jagged form make you think this was quick. The result took over 100 sketches.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Picasso<\/strong> continued to <strong>examine the female nude<\/strong>, as artists have done throughout western art history. He created his <strong>personal fantasy<\/strong> by playing on the reclining female nude with not one but five women.<\/p>\n<p>He also had anxiety about sleeping with prostitutes. There was considerable anxiety over life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, pleasure was linked to morality in an era before antibiotics.<\/p>\n<p>Here he created his version of <strong>Cubism<\/strong>. This was a new visual style in art.<\/p>\n<p>Picasso\u2019s intense <strong>competitive nature<\/strong> drove him to outdo his rivals (Matisse) and role models (Cezanne).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Audience Response<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The viewers responded with complete confusion, and disgust. They felt he had butchered historical art traditions. What possible reason could there be for this?<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The title is in reference to a famed Avignon Street in Barcelona which <strong>Picasso<\/strong> frequented.<\/p>\n<p>The work is of <strong>five prostitutes<\/strong>.\u00a0 The women stare directly at the viewer. This builds on what Olympia had done for art.\u00a0 <strong><em>Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon <\/em><\/strong>replaces sensual eroticism of traditional female nudes, with aggressively crude pornography. Notice the figure squatting in the lower right.<\/p>\n<p>The faces are splintered and inspired by African masks. Two women push aside curtains, while the others strike seductive and erotic poses. We see that this has become a show for <strong>Picasso.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Originally, the work contained two men, but he removed them. Why? If men were present, women would attend to them. If there were no men, <strong>Picasso<\/strong> was their focus. Viewers become the customers.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Desirable vs. Dangerous<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Picasso frequently went to brothels. Across Europe, there was a growing public health crisis, with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\u00a0 Prostitutes were beginning to be seen as intriguing, and desirable, but dangerous. Getting an STD could literally kill you.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Faces were <strong>influenced by Primitivism and African masks<\/strong> that Picasso had collected. France was still a major colonial power in Africa. Many African artworks were taken and sold in Paris.<\/p>\n<p>The work was also <strong>inspired by Archaic statuary<\/strong> (Anavysos Kouros). The figure on the far left shows this (one leg forward, arm down by side). Picasso had recently seen an exhibition of archaic sculpture at the Louvre.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Pablo Picasso<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)<\/strong> contributed to many art movements including Surrealism, Neoclassicism and Expressionism.

Lovers are quite common in art history, but these lovers don\u2019t look anything like other lovers we have seen. \u00a0Think: <em>The Swing<\/em>. The artists rejected the Vienna art establishment.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of lovers preoccupied <strong>Klimt<\/strong>. This shows love as an icon and something to be worshipped and adored. This illustrates a transcendent universal experience even in times of great change and modernization. The work is an ideal of what love can be.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is the <strong>theme of lovers<\/strong>, united through a kiss. They are embracing in a field of flowers which is reminiscent of fertility, and vibrancy. The man is bent over the woman, and she clings tightly to him as he kisses her. They are dangerously close to the edge of the precipice. This is likely due to the fin de si\u00e8cle anxiety expressed through the danger and beauty of their passion.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>golden halo<\/strong> surrounds the couple, and unites them, as they are lost in the kiss<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>man<\/strong> is physically powerful. We see the intensity of his desire. He is larger and dominates her. This is detailed, with <strong>rectangular and square forms<\/strong>. The <strong>woman<\/strong> is passively falling into his embrace. This is detailed with <strong>ovals and circles<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Love transports them out of our world. The background is flat and gold, unlike our world. This is similar to the Byzantine use of gold. They are transported to a sacred infinite world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Klimt<\/strong> follows tradition in the gender representations of the two figures&#8212;also Byzantine conventions, in this theme of lovers<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Fin de si\u00e8cle<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Fin de si\u00e8cle<\/strong> or end of an era was at the end of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century to 1914.

Placement of complementary colors in close proximity makes them more active. On a color wheel, green, yellow, orange, red and purple are all in a row. This breaks with the traditional approach to color. Also note the bold brushwork.<\/p>\n<p>There is an incorrect rendering of space. A study of ovals and circles, becomes flattened as they do not recede all at the same angle. This enables us to see the fish simultaneously from two different angles. It is not necessary to perfectly imitate reality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>By depicting the goldfish and the water, Matisse captures <strong>a stereotypical Western view of an Arab paradise.<\/strong> He invites the viewer to indulge in the pleasure of watching the goldfish. He wanted art that would be <strong>soothing and calming<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This is the use of color in a new and vibrant way &#8211;like Gauguin.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>We see Matisse\u2019s own garden furniture, plants, and fish tank.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Goldfish were introduced to Europe from East Asia in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>Goldfish were a reoccurring subject in the work of <strong>Henri Matisse<\/strong>. He visited Morocco, in 1912, and noted how the local population would daydream for hours, gazing into fishbowls. People found them tranquil, entrancing and calming.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Matisse<\/strong> admired Moroccans\u2019 lifestyle which appeared to him to be relaxed and contemplative. This is a dangerous \u2013 but common \u2013 Western fantasy of Arab\/Oriental life. We saw Ingres and Gauguin do this same thing.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of paradise is prevalent. Even the name <strong><em>Goldfish<\/em><\/strong> defines these creatures as a shorthand for paradise and a golden age, with beautiful shimmering scales.

They believed they would be a bridge to the future. They promoted an entirely new way of being an artist. The focus was on distorted, jagged forms and color to display emotion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Die Br\u00fccke artists<\/strong> were interested in \u201cprimitive\u201d art, particularly from Africa. They believed \u201cprimitive\u201d art was honest, direct, and purer than art from Western industrialized nations. Obviously, this is not a politically correct notion, but it had a huge impact on Expressionism. Die Br\u00fccke artists wanted to adopt the \u201cnatural\u201d state they saw in \u201cprimitive\u201d art.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>1913<\/strong> Die Br\u00fccke disbanded. It was two years before this painting was created.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>1914<\/strong> Kirchner volunteered to be a driver in WWI. He did this to avoid being drafted in a more dangerous combat role. He suffered a mental break down and was diagnosed as an alcoholic and barbiturate addict. He was discharged.<\/p>\n<p>The artist returned to Berlin to paint but suffered a nervous breakdown again. Then, he lived in two mental institutions. He became severely addicted to alcohol and morphine. For a time, his hands and feet were paralyzed, and his limbs did not function as they should have.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being well-received internationally (some argue he is as important, if not more so, than Picasso), <strong>his art was rejected by Hitler in the 1930s. <\/strong>Hitler persecuted artists who painted in a style that was outside of his \u201cAryan ideal\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Degenerate Art Show in 1937<\/strong> was held by Hitler. He exhibited all modernist art he hated and 32 of the works were Kirchner\u2019s. Hitler had over 600 of Kirchner\u2019s works removed from public collections. Many were destroyed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kirchner shot and killed himself in July of 1938. <\/strong>He tried to get his girlfriend to do it with him. She refused and they had a huge fight.

It moves towards absolute pure abstraction. There is an asymmetrical balance and total flatness. The image is simplified and non-representational. There is absolute abstraction without any reference to objects in nature.<\/p>\n<p>The painting has no individual brushstrokes. This is very difficult to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow <\/em><\/strong>uses pure primary colours of white, black, red, blue and yellow.

As a result of WWI, people had been so torn apart that they needed something to unite them.<\/p>\n<p>Mondrian felt that pure abstraction was the only relevant, clear, and universal language. This could create the harmony and order the world needed this after WWI.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">Primary colors and white and black<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Black grid that creates squares and rectangles of white, blue, red, and yellow<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art needed to reflect a greater universal truth as this was in question after WWI.

However, if it is not familiar to you, you must be taught.<\/p>\n<p>What is the only thing that everyone universally can understand? Formalism and abstraction because there is no message to understand. That is the unifying power of abstraction.<\/p>\n<p>If art is going to be relevant, it must change to become universal.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Piet Mondrian (1872-1944)<\/strong> was one of the founders of the Dutch modern movement\u00a0De Stijl.

There are not enough feet and legs to support all the figures in the top half.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>unorthodox landscape<\/strong> excludes the horizon line, sky, or wide view. Instead, it is tight and cluttered.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is the artist\u2019s <strong>emotional representation of the history of slavery<\/strong> in Lam\u2019s native Cuba. It also illustrates how he thinks contemporary Cubans are viewed by Westerners as exotic and primitive. He uses stereotypes to combat stereotypes. This draws attention to the issues to oppression of Afro-Cubans and the harmful nature of Western stereotypes of the region.<\/p>\n<p>Lam argues Afro-Cuban culture has been reduced to an absurdity, of both the exotic and primitive.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The figures with <strong>crescent-shaped faces<\/strong> like African\/Pacific masks, are in a landscape of Cuban sugarcane fields.\u00a0 Lam often utilized symbols of Afro-Cuban culture, particularly Santeria (mix of Catholicism and African spirituality). In Santeria, the supernatural merges with the natural world through masks and animals. The figures are human, animal and mystical all at once.<\/p>\n<p>At <strong>the top right<\/strong>, the furthest figure holds a pair of shears in reference to harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>To call it <strong><em>The Jungle<\/em><\/strong> suggests a search for a primitive culture. We are not in an urban or civilized area, but an untamed wilderness. Lam paints <strong>sugarcane and tobacco<\/strong> which are domesticated plants. Sugarcane is alien to the jungle setting, rather, it is grown in fields.<\/p>\n<p>So why the Jungle? It captures the exotic, wild Western fantasy of tropical Cuba and reduces its inhabitants to strange, mystical hybrids who are not fully \u201ccivilized\u201d.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Originally enslaved by Spanish and Portuguese traders, Africans were forced to work sugarcane fields and convert to Catholicism. Africans continued to practice their native religion in the safety of jungles and fields.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1940s in Cuba, <strong>sugarcane<\/strong> was big business. It required the toil of thousands of laborers. The reality of Cubans engaged in hard labor was in sharp contrast to how foreigners experienced the island as a tropical playground. While Americans enjoyed Cuba as a resort experience, US corporations ran their sugar businesses. The US controlled Cuban policies for decades.<\/p>\n<p>Lam painted this after returning to Cuba from a trip to Europe where he was introduced to <strong>Surrealism. <\/strong>Surrealists aimed to unleash the unconscious mind. This freed things that have been suppressed. It brought with it dream-like distortions.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Wifredo Lam <\/strong>(1902-1982) was a Cuban artist and the grandson of an Afro-Cuban slave.
