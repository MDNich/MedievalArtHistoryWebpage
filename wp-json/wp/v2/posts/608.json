The influence of the Christian religion in art and the triumph of Christianity throughout the Middle Ages could be measured by the number of buildings constructed for worship .To welcome an increasing number faithful, encourage pilgrimage and show its power, the Church built larger places of worship and adjusted the inner space by adding at first side-aisles and an ambulatory followed by radial chapels behind the choir.<\/p>\n<p>If the golden age of the first is in the 11th-12th centuries, that of the Gothic corresponds to the 12th-15th centuries, also called &#8220;the time of cathedrals\u201d. These two very opposite styles of church the <strong>Romanesque and the Gothic<\/strong> allow a double reading of the objective sought by the representatives of the Church.<\/p>\n<p>For some, the \u201chouse of God\u201d must be the modest and not \u201cflashy\u201d. Ideally it should be a medium-sized building, with few openings and little light, with a very sober decor avoiding any distraction and encouraging the faithful to focus on prayer. This is <strong>the conception of the Romanesque style<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Romanesque Church<\/strong> can be formally described as a massive building with <strong>stone vaults<\/strong> and a great sobriety. It will <strong>progress into the shape of a Latin cross <\/strong>. To support these massive stone vaults the <strong>thickness of the walls<\/strong> were increased or the height of the nave controlled by <strong>reducing the dimensions of the windows<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Romanesque art rediscovers the process of the <strong>vault <\/strong>known to the Romans. The ceilings were initially made of wood. Later the architects favored the stone vault, as it was heavier and generating mainly thrusts on the sides. The barrel vault technique combined with the use of stone allows the construction of larger and more massive buildings because the walls carrying the vault are reinforced by <strong>buttresses.<\/strong>\u00a0 The rounded stone barrel vault, the interior supports and exterior buttresses (walls used to reinforce the facades that support the vault) were often massive.<\/p>\n<p>From the 12th century , we witness <strong>monumental sculptures<\/strong>, as French artists discovered statuary . The <strong>Church of Sainte-Foy<\/strong> is one of the most famous Romanesque churches in France because of its Judgement tympanum and its symbolic control flow of the pilgrims. They entered through the sinners\u2019 part, prayed in the church to the relics of Saint -Foy and exited the church on the entrance guarded by the interceding Saint-Foy, patriarchs, and the Virgin Mary.<\/p>\n<p>The spread of <strong>Romanesque art<\/strong> led to <strong>regional styles<\/strong>. In France, the Burgundian School built monuments , preceded by imposing porches and covered with a rich sculpture (Cluny). Yet, along the Rhine the churches are severe, massive buildings with multiple towers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-618\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/58-Church-shot-2.jpg?resize=459%2C611&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"459\" height=\"611\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/58-Church-shot-2.jpg?w=517&amp;ssl=1 517w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/58-Church-shot-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-619\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gothis-church.jpg?resize=460%2C608&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gothis-church.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gothis-church.jpg?resize=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Evolution of Gothic Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Gothic art<\/strong> resulted from a slow evolution of Romanesque art . It owed its success to the technical solution it brought to the problem of supporting the vault . Its first step was the use of the <strong>groin vaulting and a pointed arch<\/strong>.\u00a0 This was probably borrowed from Islamic architecture. It relieved some of the thrust and helped reduce the size of the columns. The new slender columns appear in the late Romanesque buildings.<\/p>\n<p>In the 12th century, the French architects succeeded in supporting the heavy Romanesque vault on <strong>ribbed vaulting with the addition of cross ribs<\/strong>. Later different fan vaulting shapes extended from the tops of the columns. It therefore sufficed to apply flying buttresses to the outside, so that these in turn transmitted the thrust to the lateral buttresses, placed on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>The thick side walls serving as reinforcements were removed and huge broken arch windows, typical of Gothic art, were pierced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stained-glass windows<\/strong> developed and enlarged. The art of stained glass also appeared in the 12th century reflecting a spiritual intention to offer the faithful the feeling of entering a sacred space bathed in a divine light, and to educate the illiterate masses on the stories of the Old\/New Testament. The mastery of the technique is developing on several sites including Chartres, and the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris.<\/p>\n<p>To manufacture stained glass windows with a great intensity of colors, it is necessary to have pigments in large quantities. These pigments were rare, expensive and some had to be imported from great distances like lapis lazuli with which to obtain a deep blue. The quality of the stained-glass windows in Paris proves the significant financial expenses collected and incurred in the construction of the cathedral.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing amounts of tracery, or ornate stonework that held the windows, became more decorated. Other stonework such as <strong>pinnacles, and gargoyles<\/strong> was added as well. This period corresponds to that of <strong>primitive Gothic ( 1140-1200 )<\/strong> which was followed by the era of <strong>triumphant\/Golden Age Gothic ( 1200-1400 )<\/strong> which continued until the Renaissance in the <strong>mid-15th century, so-called flamboyant Gothic.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The imposing cathedrals date mainly from the golden age of Gothic, <strong>Notre-Dame de Paris<\/strong> (started in 1163 ), with its powerful towers and vast grandstands, <strong>Notre-Dame de Chartres<\/strong> ( 1194 ) with its immense nave and its three portals, adorned with statues; the royal <strong>Notre-Dame de Reims<\/strong> ( 1210 ) with its famous facade and incomparable statuary and <strong>Saint Peter Cathedral of Cologne<\/strong> (1248\u20131473). From the oldest to the most recent, there is an incessant search for progress and an increasing lightness in construction.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the cathedrals were not completed in the 13th century and even remained incomplete for a long time. The resources necessary for finishing them were provided by all social classes. The clergy provided funding and provided religious themes for the decoration of the building. The Christians also took part in it providing their free work force on construction sites and contributing financially as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>During the Gothic period the cathedrals under construction required sculptures<\/strong> and it developed funerary sculpture tools. There was a renewal of the iconographic themes. For the tympanums the preferred scene was the one of the Last Judgment, gallery of the kings of Judah. Responsible for creating volume emphasizing shapes and putting them in motion, the sculptures participated in the dynamics of the facade, to the detriment of their own purpose. The face of the saints had to express this tension and stand out in its sovereign grandeur.<\/p>\n<p>In other fields of art such as the illuminated manuscripts, and the tapestries the contribution is less innovative. The metalwork of precious arts and the enamels develop together with the cult of relics, but many early models such as the statue of Saint-Foy contained spolia.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Pointing Out the Differences<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-621\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gothic-Arch-Drawing.jpg?resize=900%2C375&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gothic-Arch-Drawing.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gothic-Arch-Drawing.jpg?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Cutaway View of a Typical French Gothic Cathedral<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-622\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Gothic-Cutaway.jpg?resize=707%2C944&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"707\" height=\"944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Gothic-Cutaway.jpg?w=707&amp;ssl=1 707w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Gothic-Cutaway.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>pinnacle<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>flying buttress<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>vaulting web<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>diagonal rib<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>transverse rib<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>springing<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>clerestory<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>oculus<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>lancet<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>triforium<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>nave arcade<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>compound pier with responds<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5><strong>Notre-Dame.

This prompted the rise of urban commerce and a more complex social structure that included merchants and artisans. Paris emerged as the intellectual and cultural capital of Gothic Europe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trade guilds \u2014controlled the production and sale of goods and services. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The strong sense of communal identity that emerged was reinforced by public buildings, churches, artworks, monuments, and ceremonies in cities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Universities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The rise of urban life was simultaneous with the rise of intellectual life. Universities like Oxford, Padua, and Paris supplanted the monastic schools as centers of learning. These universities educated not only theologians but also lawyers, doctors, and philosophers.<\/p>\n<p>This expansion of secular knowledge led to increasing observation of nature. Gothic religious imagery evolved to incorporate more subjects from the natural world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Philosophy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the universities and cathedral schools, a new system of philosophy, scholasticism, arose in response to the renewed interest in texts from classical antiquity by crusaders in the eastern Mediterranean.<\/p>\n<p>Classical philosophy that promoted rational inquiry challenged Christian theology, which was based on faith. To reconcile the two, theologians applied logic to faith and developed a system of reasoned analysis. By creating logical proofs, scholastic thinkers could explain supernatural phenomena\u2014even the existence of god.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monarchy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Church remained the chief patron of the arts.<\/p>\n<p>The courts of the secular monarchs increased the representation of nonreligious subjects and political use of sacred imagery.<\/p>\n<p>These monarchies also facilitated the spread of the Gothic style throughout Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Gothic pointed arches and tracery patterns appeared on town halls, illustrated books, decorative objects, table settings, textile patterns, and even shoes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Books, Frescos\u2014It Is All Narrative<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>During the <strong>Gothic period, bookmaking shifted from monasteries shut off from the world to urban workshops of professional artists for patrons<\/strong> that included the royal family, scholars, and merchants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saint Louis<\/strong> was an avid collector of both secular and religious books, and his mother, <strong>Blanche of Castile, commissioned a moralized Bible for him<\/strong>.

This style of architecture was developed in the Ile de France area around Paris, that was ruled by the King of France.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pointed arches<\/strong> were created by moving rounded Roman arches upward. This enables the stress lines to move inward towards the ground, not out diagonally. With taller arches, the roof of the buildings could be raised creating <strong>taller ceilings<\/strong>. This resulted in a need for light. <strong>Stained glass<\/strong> became prevalent in Gothic architecture. It allowed not only sunshine through but provided a highly decorative feature.<\/p>\n<p>These raised elements caused less weight on the structures, resulting in <strong>thinner walls<\/strong>. To support these walls <strong>flying buttresses <\/strong>were installed to support the arches, right at the point that they were straightening.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Fa\u00e7ade<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-435\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-435\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/60-Chartres-Cathedral-B-2.jpg?resize=500%2C791&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/60-Chartres-Cathedral-B-2.jpg?w=203&amp;ssl=1 203w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/60-Chartres-Cathedral-B-2.jpg?resize=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1 190w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chartres Cathedral<br \/>\u00a9 Vanni Archive\/Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The <strong>fa\u00e7ade<\/strong> of the building is simple.

Mathematics grew in interest as it was believed God created the world according to perfect measurements.

This is to depict that the Christ child has enormous wisdom even as a baby.<\/p>\n<p>There is a white dove over Mary that extends three rays of light towards Mary\u2019s halo.\u00a0 This is a reference to the Trinity and that Mary acted as an intercessor between God the father and God the son. Six angels gather around Mary and Christ, holding candles and incense.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2 (Great Portal of the West Fa\u00e7ade)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-438\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-438\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/60-Chartes-Catherdral-Great-Portal-of-the-West-Facade.jpg?resize=650%2C517&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/60-Chartes-Catherdral-Great-Portal-of-the-West-Facade.jpg?w=392&amp;ssl=1 392w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/60-Chartes-Catherdral-Great-Portal-of-the-West-Facade.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Great Portal of the West Facade<br \/>\u00a9 Scala\/White Images\/Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-631\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/60-jambs.jpg?resize=518%2C704&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/60-jambs.jpg?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/60-jambs.jpg?resize=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>portal<\/strong> is the entrance to a church. <strong>Jambs <\/strong>and <strong>jamb figures<\/strong> are columns surrounding the door, and figures on them. This is nicknamed the <strong>Royal Portal<\/strong> because the jamb figures depict Old Testament royalty and therefore the relatives of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The figures are very elongated with no sense of weigh.

Next there was a Roman temple, that was converted into a Christian church by the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> century. Then, in the 9<sup>th<\/sup> century the church received a relic from Constantinople &#8211;the tunic of Mary. It was rumoured to have been given to the Catholic Church by Charlemagne after a trip to Jerusalem<\/p>\n<p>A Romanesque Church constructed 1145 \u2013 1155. This church burned to the ground in 1194. The tunic\u00a0 was believed to be lost!<\/p>\n<p>Then, three days later, the tunic was discovered unharmed in the crypt below the church. This was seen as a true miracle!<\/p>\n<p>The interpretation of this event was that Mary wanted to get rid of the old Romanesque style church, so that a Gothic church could be built for her tunic. A new Gothic church was constructed from 1194 \u2013 1220, but the old Romanesque fa\u00e7ade remained.<\/p>\n<p>The Gothic era was a hard time to live through. Diseases spread. Wars prevailed. Interest in Mary developed, as Mary became the figure you could appeal to and intercede on your behalf. \u00a0There was Marian Devotion or Cult of the Virgin along with increased participation in Church life.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 61.

The couple gave birth to Louis IX.\u00a0 When Louis VIII died from dysentery in 1226, she ruled as regent because Louis IX was just 12 years old. As a woman in power, she was accused on adultery and even murder.<\/p>\n<p>Louis IX grew up to lead the 7<sup>th<\/sup> and 8<sup>th<\/sup> crusades. In 1270, he and was canonized as a saint in 1297, by Pope Boniface VIII.
