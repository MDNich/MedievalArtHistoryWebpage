This piece is comprised of <strong>silver gilt worked in filigree with inlays of garnets and other stones<\/strong>. These are a pair of broaches (fibula would be the singular) that are each 4 inches long.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Decorative Art?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Decorative arts fall under the category of Fine Arts&#8212; includes sculpture, painting, and architecture. Decorative arts are beautiful utilitarian objects. Think clocks, jewelry, vases, tea pots, and furniture.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Methods Used to Create this Jewelry\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chase<\/strong> metal or shape it by hammering. Other examples of <strong>chasing<\/strong> include indenting to ornament metal.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Filigree<\/strong> metal into delicate shapes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gild<\/strong> the work with silver or cover the metal with silver. This is an example of silver gilt, but pieces can also be done in gold.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cloisonn\u00e9<\/strong> work using small wires to make little cups.<strong> Cloisonn\u00e9<\/strong> was a popular technique in early Medieval art. The term means \u201cpartitioned\u201d in French. Artists would attach wires onto a metal base to create various shapes. Then stones were placed in these shapes<\/li>\n<li>Finish <strong>cloisonn\u00e9<\/strong> by inlaying the garnets and other stones.<\/li>\n<li>Attach pin on the back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Made Popular by Roman Soldiers<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>These pieces of decorative art jewelry have a <strong>utilitarian purpose<\/strong>. Before buttons existed, they were used\u00a0 to fasten garments, such as cloaks and capes.\u00a0 Wearing A fibula (fib-you-luh) or fibulae(fib-you-lay) was a status symbol. Later pieces were used as a sign of the Christian faith.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Examining the Jewelry Up Close <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This style of fibulae was called a crossbow because it resembled the weapon.<\/p>\n<p>The side of an eagle\u2019s head appears on these pieces. Eagles were originally a Greek\/Roman symbol of Zeus\/Jupiter. Later these birds were used to reference Saint John. <strong>Garnets<\/strong>, red semi precious stones makeup the eyes of the eagles.<\/p>\n<p>The fish are in reference to Christ\u2019s miracle of loaves and fishes, when he created enough to feed hundreds.<\/p>\n<p>These fibulae had another use. At the bottom of each is a small loop, so the jewelry could also be worn as pendants.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who were the<\/strong> <strong>Merovingians<\/strong>?<\/h5>\n<p>The Merovingians were a barbarian group who ruled a large part of France and northern Spain.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the <strong>Art of the Migration<\/strong> period that was produced by Barbarians from 300-900 CE, this art became increasingly more Christian as barbarians adopted the religion.<\/p>\n<p>Fibulae were originally pins used by Roman military members. Barbarians later followed this example. These pieces of jewelry were commonly found in barbarian grave sites.\u00a0 The <strong><em>Merovingian looped fibulae<\/em><\/strong> were found in the grave of a wealthy Merovingian woman in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>Little documentation exists about Barbarians, so these works provide some of the only concrete evidence. It reveals proficiency and skill of barbarian metal workers.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Hiberno-Saxon Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This was the art of the British Isles in the Early Medieval period. <strong>Hibernia<\/strong> is an ancient name for Ireland. <strong>Saxon <\/strong>was the Germanic tribes in Great Britain. Hiberno-Saxon art flourished in monasteries through illuminated manuscripts. Prevalent were interlacing patterns, stylized animal, and horror vacui, or using every space on the page.<\/p>\n<p>In 432, St. Patrick established a church in Ireland. \u00a0He began the Christianization of the Celts on the remote island that had never known Roman rule.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Other Medieval Jewelry<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>You may also enjoy reading about other jewelry from the time such as :<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/jewish-marrage-rings\/\">Jewish Marriage Rings<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/unveiling-the-world-of-byzantine-brides\/\">Unveiling the World of Byzantine Brides<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 55.
