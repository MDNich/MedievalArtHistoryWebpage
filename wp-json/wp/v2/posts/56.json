These theories and interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated, and adapted to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Gathering Contextual Information<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Contextual information for Ancient Greek and Roman art can be derived from contemporary literary, political, legal, and economic records, as well as from archaeological excavations conducted from the mid-18th century onward. \u00a0Etruscan art, by contrast, is illuminated primarily by modern archaeological record and by descriptions of contemporary external observers.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Categorizing Ancient Mediterranean Art <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The arts of these early western artistic cultures are generally studied chronologically. Additionally, archaeological models and stylistic analysis have identified periods based on stylistic changes. Artworks are assigned to periods according to styles, for example archaic Greek. It may also be categorized by governments, or dynasties such as the Roman Republic. This is also dependent on the available technology, and the availability of evidence.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Foundation for Later Development<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ancient Greek and Roman art provided the foundation for the later development of European and Mediterranean artistic traditions. From the 18th century onward, European, and American observers admired ancient Greek and Roman ethical and governmental systems.\u00a0 This contributed to prioritizing art and architecture that could be associated with political elites and cultural capitals, for example Rome. More recently, art historians have examined art produced by contemporary subjects or \u201cprovincial\u201d populations.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the earliest written statements about artists and art making survive from the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. Little survives of the rich Etruscan literary tradition that is documented in Roman sources.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 31.

However, literature gives us a clue as to who created the pieces found at the <strong>Temple of Minerva<\/strong>.

It is work full of energy, with a display of movement. Note the dramatic twist and <strong>contrapposto<\/strong> of the figure. The <strong>wet drapery<\/strong> imitates the look of water upon the body.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Found on the island of Samothrace<\/strong> in a sanctuary in a harbor, she faces the way that the wind typically blows, which explains the flutter of the drapery.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace<\/strong> was built to commemorate a naval victory by the Greeks. Which battle remains unclear, but many scholars point to the Battle of Cos between Macedonians and Egyptians<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Nike the Goddess of Victory<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was meant to sit on a fountain, as a figurehead on a boat. The fountain would splash water on the figure as if the waves were dashing up against the ship. The statue would have reflected off the water, giving it a sense of movement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Winged Victory of Samothrace<\/strong>, is the messenger goddess of victory, <strong>Nike<\/strong>. Her missing right arm may have raised a victory crown or been held up in greeting. A fragment found in 1948 seems to be from this statue and indicates her arm was raised.<\/p>\n<p>Her clothing is pulled tightly across her abdomen and left leg. It bunches up in thick layers around her front right leg. This makes the figure seems to be alive and breathing. The work is intensely emotive.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Backgrounder on Hellenism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Hellenism began after the death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE). At this point, the strain and change in Greek life prompted artists to explore a wider range of emotion. This was most apparent in sculpture. These new works had a greater variety of expression through motion, movement, and energy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ancient Mediterranean Art 3500 BCE- 300 BCE TOPIC 2.4\u00a0Theories and Interpretations of Ancient Mediterranean Art\u00a0 The study of art history &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/mediterranean-art-2-4\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Ancient Mediterranean Art 2.4<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[7,25],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=56"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2286,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56\/revisions\/2286"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=56"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=56"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=56"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
