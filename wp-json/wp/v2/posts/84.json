There was constant political change in the region, because of the geography. They were slow to construct unified communities because of the openness to the outside world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Religion<\/strong> played a significant role in the art and architecture of the ancient Near East. Cosmology guided representation of deities and kings who, themselves, assumed divine attributes.<\/p>\n<p>Artists created fully developed formal sculptures of <strong>human figures<\/strong> and artistic conventions representing the <strong>human form<\/strong>. This was a combination of <strong>profile<\/strong> and <strong>three-quarter view<\/strong>. Important figures were designed to be set apart using a <strong>hierarchical scale<\/strong> or a division of composition into horizontal sections or registers. These works provide early examples of historical narratives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Architectural representations<\/strong> include monumental ziggurats and monumental settings for the worship of many deities, that proclaimed the power and authority of rulers. Architecture was restricted by available materials. There were no stone quarries or forests, so the use of <strong>mud sun baked bricks<\/strong> was the technology.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The Neolithic Revolution first occurred in <strong>Mesopotamia<\/strong>, a Greek word that means the &#8220;land between the [Tigris and Euphrates] rivers.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The Tigris and Euphrates were volatile rivers, leading to the belief that animistic gods were temperamental and punishing.<\/li>\n<li>Multiple city-states tried to control these lower valleys.<\/li>\n<li>Ancient Near East art supported the state and religion.<\/li>\n<li>Buildings were created for religion <strong>(ziggurats)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Buildings were created for the state <strong>(palaces)<\/strong>. Kings realized that art could help them glorify their rules.<\/li>\n<li>Stone was expensive, wood was scarce, but earth\/dirt was abundant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>The Story<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Mesopotamia<\/strong> was located in <strong>present-day Iraq and eastern Syria<\/strong>. Located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, this region was perfect for the establishment of early agriculture. The earliest development of agriculture in this region dates to about 9000 B.C.E., during the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, period.<\/p>\n<p>The people who lived in this <strong>fertile area<\/strong> were able to grow and store food, and they no longer had to rely on a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle. As a result, they began settling areas to tend to their crops, and towns and cities arose. Agriculture slowly transformed the civilizations in other areas of the Ancient Near East as well an area that also includes Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Cyprus.<\/p>\n<p>Between 3500 B.C.E and 330 B.C.E., successive societies rose to power through invasions with <strong>the goal to control the wealth, water (for irrigation), and agricultural resources of the area<\/strong>. The balance of power shifted between outside invaders and local powers.<\/p>\n<p>The Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian (or SANBAN) societies, followed by Persia, <strong>influenced each other culturally<\/strong> by reacting to or rejecting the previous culture. Their art and architecture reflect these reactions, rejections, and cultural interconnections.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-320\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Map.jpg?resize=990%2C561&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Map.jpg?w=1055&amp;ssl=1 1055w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Map.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Map.jpg?resize=1024%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Mesopotamian-Map.jpg?resize=768%2C435&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sumerian Influence<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the fourth millennium B.C.E., a civilization called Sumer arose in southern Mesopotamia.

Under kings Darius I (r. 521\u2013486 B.C.E.) and Xerxes (r. 485\u2013465 B.C.E.), they constructed a vast capital city, Persepolis.<\/p>\n<p>Persepolis reflected not only continuity with Mesopotamian tradition but also the multicultural influences from the Persian Empire, Egypt, and Greece<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Temples<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Sumerians lived in a world created and supervised by <strong>a pantheon of gods and goddesses<\/strong> who were each associated with specific natural forces or human endeavors. Emulating the power structures of the divine realm, each Sumerian city-state was under the protection of a deity. The <strong>main temple<\/strong> of the city was dedicated to its protective deity and located at the center of the city-state on a ziggurat, a large trapezoidal platform. The height of the ziggurat indicates the desire to reach to the heavens or connect with the deities. Ziggurats could sometimes have many levels and were used by most subsequent civilizations of Mesopotamia.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>central location of the temple<\/strong> is representative of the importance of the city-state deity and the impact of the deity upon daily life.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>The White Temple<\/strong><\/em> is one of the earliest ziggurats from the city-state Uruk. As Sumerian builders did not have access to stone quarries, they <strong>built the temple from mudbrick<\/strong>, which was fragile.

The Sumerians referred to their temples as \u201cwaiting rooms,\u201d a reflection of their belief that the deity would descend from the heavens to appear before the priests in the cella.<\/p>\n<p>There were also statue representations of those who worship the deities in the Sumerian temples. The forms of the bodies of the <strong>Statues of votive figures<\/strong> are simplified and lack details of musculature. Standing on large, sturdy feet, each figure is erect and attentive in posture, theoretically in an expected posture of worship.<\/p>\n<p>They always hold a small vessel in front of his or her body as an offering to the gods, and their hands seem to be folded in prayer around them. They have enormous, saucer-like eyes that are wide open and elevated as if they are looking at the deity and as a sign of piety. The eyes and eyebrows would be inlaid with dark stone in a similar fashion to the <strong>Mask of Waka<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>These <strong>Statues of votive figures<\/strong> are not portraits intended to represent the physical appearance of specific people; rather, they symbolically stand in place of the worshippers, offering prayers in their place night and day in the temple.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sculptural Status<\/strong><\/h5>\n<h5><strong>Head of an Akkadian ruler (Sargon)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Cultures that thrived after the Sumerian culture\u2019s decline demonstrated figural representations of leaders similar to the Sumerian representations of deities. The Akkadians ruled in Mesopotamia between the Sumerian and Neo-Sumerian periods, beginning with their first king, Sargon of Akkad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Head of an Akkadian ruler (Sargon)<\/strong> employs highly stylized elements, such as the corkscrew curls in the beard like those in the Bull-headed lyre, eyebrows, hair, and headdress, which all indicate the royalty and ideal male appearance of the leader.<\/p>\n<p>While the head was initially a tribute to and symbol of the ruler\u2019s power, damage to the left side of the face and removal of the inlaid eyes appears deliberate and suggests that the head was symbolically destroyed to put an end to its power, deprive its ability to hear and see, and end the reign of the Akkadian ruler.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Stele of Naram-Sin<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The grandson of Sargon I was also portrayed in Akkadian artworks.

The standard <strong>used narrative to express both a story and support of the ruler in the story.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Standard of Ur has two sides<\/em><\/strong>: one symbolizing <strong>war<\/strong> and one symbolizing <strong>peace<\/strong>. Both sides present a story and are divided into three registers. The registers are distinguished by a ground line. The images are read left to right, beginning in the lower left-hand corner and ending in the upper right-hand corner.<\/p>\n<p>Similar narrative forms are included on various <strong>Sumerian artworks<\/strong>, including musical instruments. Musical instruments, such as lyres, were included with grave goods placed within the burial chambers. The registers on the <strong><em>Bull\u2013headed lyre<\/em><\/strong>, like the <strong><em>Standard of Ur<\/em><\/strong>, would most likely be read from bottom to top.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2386\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Bell-headed-lyre.jpg?resize=933%2C307&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"933\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Bell-headed-lyre.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Bell-headed-lyre.jpg?resize=300%2C99&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Bull-headed lyre <\/em>and detail from tomb at Royal Cemetery.

The detail from the lyre depicts a banquet, just as the peace side of the standard. The attendants bring food and wine for the celebration. As in the <strong><em>Standard of Ur<\/em><\/strong>, a lyre player entertains the guests. The man at the top of the composition is clearly an important figure. Because the lyre was buried with the king in the grave, the power of the man, shown subduing two bulls, likely reflects the power and position of the king.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Babylonians<\/strong> employed narrative similar to that in Sumerian artworks. In the <strong><em>Code of Hammurabi<\/em><\/strong>, a code of rules and regulations, the Babylonian ruler is depicted approaching the sun god Shamash. Shamash gives him the ring and rod, symbols of authority.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Egyptian<\/strong> culture also used narrative to show the connection of the elite to deities. An extremely well-preserved example is the <strong>Last judgment of Hu-Nefer<\/strong>. The scroll made of papyrus, was found in the tomb of a royal priest, and was placed among the wrappings of Hu-Nefer\u2019s mummified body to help him reach his final destination in the afterlife.<\/p>\n<p>The scrolls depict scenes from what the Egyptians considered the last judgment after death\u2014two tests presided over by Osiris, the god of the underworld. Egyptians believed the deceased were questioned about their behavior in life and their hearts were weighed. Egyptians believed the heart to house the soul. The deceased were then presented to Osiris. The figures are presented in composite view, like in the <strong><em>Standard of Ur<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The figure of Hu-Nefer is presented on an equal scale with the figures performing the ceremony. But the god Osiris is portrayed as much larger than the other figures, even while sitting, demonstrating Egyptian use of hierarchical scale. Similar to <strong><em>Hammurabi in the Code of Hammurabi<\/em><\/strong>, Hu-Nefer\u2019s ability depicted alongside the gods is a symbol of his authority.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Power, the Assyrian Way<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Another frequently depicted <strong>subject in Assyrian relief sculpture was the ritual animal hunt<\/strong>. Among the many animals hunted was the <strong>Mesopotamian lion<\/strong>.

Although viewers today may observe the suffering of the lions with sympathy, an Assyrian viewer may have seen the creatures as vicious menaces whose slaughter by the Assyrian king represented his ability to protect his own subjects from chaos and destruction. In their use of space and specific detail, the lion hunts had propaganda functions that were similar to the images of warfare discussed previously.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2376\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dying-Lion.jpg?resize=806%2C602&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"806\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dying-Lion.jpg?w=376&amp;ssl=1 376w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dying-Lion.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Dying Lion<\/em>.

The Persians invaded Mesopotamia in the late 6th century B.C.E., creating an empire that surpassed the territory controlled by the Assyrians. The Persian rulers traced their ancestry to a figure named Achaemenes, and thus this early Persian family of rulers was known as the Achaemenid dynasty.<\/p>\n<p>The Persian kings organized a vast administrative network and system of taxation. Under kings Darius I (r. 521\u2013486 B.C.E.) and Xerxes (r. 485\u2013465 B.C.E.), they built the City of Persepolis, which reflected both the extent of their power and the diversity of the peoples over whom they ruled.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>central space in Persepolis was the apadana, or audience hall<\/strong>. It was decorated with relief sculptures reflecting the absolute power of the king over his vast empire. The Persians did not generally use hunting or battle scenes to intimidate. Rather, the decoration of Persepolis conveyed the power of the Persians through the representation of innumerable guards and soldiers, suggesting the unconquerable nature of the Persian Empire. The concept of showing power through numbers was continued in the Hall of 100 Columns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2382\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/View-of-Apanda.jpg?resize=832%2C486&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"832\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/View-of-Apanda.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/View-of-Apanda.jpg?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>View of the Apanda<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2381\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Detail-of-Guards.jpg?resize=828%2C621&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"828\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Detail-of-Guards.jpg?w=828&amp;ssl=1 828w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Detail-of-Guards.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Detail-of-Guards.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Detail-of-Guards.jpg?resize=755%2C566&amp;ssl=1 755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Detail of the Guards<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2383\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Hall-of-100-Columns.jpg?resize=823%2C550&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"823\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Hall-of-100-Columns.jpg?w=862&amp;ssl=1 862w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Hall-of-100-Columns.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Hall-of-100-Columns.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Hall-of-100-Columns.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Hall of 100 Columns<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A testament to the king&#8217;s power, <strong>the columns were topped with bull or lion heads<\/strong> to suggest the Persian king had captured the fiercest animals to hold up the roof of his palace.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2384\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Double-bull-capital-from-the-Hall-of-100-Columns..jpg?resize=748%2C719&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Double-bull-capital-from-the-Hall-of-100-Columns..jpg?w=748&amp;ssl=1 748w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Double-bull-capital-from-the-Hall-of-100-Columns..jpg?resize=300%2C288&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Double bull-capital from the Hall of 100 Columns.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Lesson Summary<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>cultures of the Ancient Near East include the Sumerian, Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian (or SANBAN), followed by Persia<\/strong>.

The figures show a <strong>twisted perspective<\/strong>, in that they are viewed in profile, with the shoulders facing forward. This work also shows a <strong>Hierarchy of scale<\/strong>. The seated figure (god) if he stood would be taller than standing figure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Images Up Close<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This stele is representational of the law and designed in three sections.<\/p>\n<p>At the <strong>top left<\/strong> is a carved relief of King Hammurabi on the, who ruled Babylonia from 1792-1750 BCE.<\/p>\n<p>To <strong>the right<\/strong> is Shamash, the sun god and god of justice.\u00a0 This is indicated by the horned crown on his head and the beams of divine light radiating from his shoulders. The god is seated on a temple throne or <strong>ziggurat<\/strong> that is perched upon mountains. He is gifting the king with a rope, rod, and ring, as a sign of power. Hammurabi is speaking in greeting and gesturing. He stands respectfully in front of Shamash.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>The Text<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are three passages. The first is the justification of Hammurabi as king as well as a glorification. \u00a0Below this is a section of 300 laws, inscribed in <strong>cuneiform script<\/strong>, in the <strong>Akkadian language<\/strong>. This determines the result of any wrong actions, which has already been established through legal precedence.<\/p>\n<p>For example, it says:<\/p>\n<p><em>If a man builds a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls and kills its owner, then the builder shall be put to death. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>The third section of text is a poem praising Hammurabi\u2019s virtues.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of The Code of Hammurabi <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was crafted to ensure that the laws were known to the public. It includes images, as the literacy rate was extremely low in ancient civilizations. These laws give a sense in history to what was important in Babylonian laws.<\/p>\n<p>It also glorified Hammurabi, as a pious and obedient ruler. The poem on the stele makes it clear that he is responsible for bringing the law to the people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work is the earliest law code ever written and likely predates the Old Testament commandments. It was exhibited at the city of Sippar in the Babylonian kingdom, with\u00a0 multiple copies placed around the kingdom.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 25.

These massive sculptures, each <strong>10 to 14 feet tall<\/strong> were guardian figures at the citadel fortress protecting the town, <strong>Dur Sharrukin,<\/strong> in what is now modern Khorsabad, Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>These works were an expression of grandeur by Sargon II, meant to ward off enemies, both real and invisible or <strong>apotropaic<\/strong>.\u00a0 The huge palace complex had 200 rooms, with 30 different courtyards. Much of the artwork inside showed narrative scenes of Sargon in warfare and the hunts.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Details of the Lamassu<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The lamassu were made to be viewed both from the front and from the side. These works were highly decorative. Parts are carved in <strong>high relief<\/strong> and parts in <strong>low relief<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The crown upon the head of each lamassu contains rosettes and double horns, along with a ring of feathers along the top. The human face contains a unibrow. The wavy hair and beard form ringlets and spirals. The only part of the face that is not human are the ears. These are the ears of a bull, with earrings that dangling down.<\/p>\n<p>Under his body and around legs are inscriptions in cuneiform, which declare power of the king and threaten anyone who ignores this.<\/p>\n<p>The legs are a trick to the eye. There are five legs per sculpture. As you approach the lamassu you can only see two, as if the creature is standing guard. There are four as it you start to move past the animal. It creates the visual illusion that it moves to let you in!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-323\" style=\"font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0625rem;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/22.-Citadel-Drawing.jpg?resize=631%2C422&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"631\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/22.-Citadel-Drawing.jpg?w=631&amp;ssl=1 631w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/22.-Citadel-Drawing.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Citadel of Sargon II.
