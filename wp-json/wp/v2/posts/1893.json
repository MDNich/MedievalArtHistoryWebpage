Discovered in 1981 at age 20, he became dazzlingly successful at a quick speed.<\/p>\n<p>He was known for his tag SAMO (Same Old Shit) written in marker and spray paint on subway trains, sidewalks, and gallery walls. This attracted the attention of gallery owners and the art world.<\/p>\n<p>Based on his success, critics referred to him as the \u201cblack Picasso\u201d. While this likened him to Picasso, Basquiat felt conflicted about this term, because the word black was added.<\/p>\n<p>He once said, \u201cIf you wanna talk about influence, man, then you\u2019ve got to realize that influence is not influence. It\u2019s simply someone\u2019s idea going through my new mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some of his paintings have sold for $20 million.

The shoulders are pulled forward, with a slumping back.<\/p>\n<p>The figure in deep despair:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>wrinkled skin<\/li>\n<li>backbone<\/li>\n<li>musculature<\/li>\n<li>veins<\/li>\n<li>missing limbs and head<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is elevated from the floor by a wood structure as base. Does this fill in for the legs? \u00a0Is this a wheelchair? Gurney?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Androgyne III<\/em> Comparison<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Human condition is a constant preoccupation of post-modern art. Once the artists started questioning the constraints the society imposes on humans, they never stopped attacking its pre-constructed judgements.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To the Polish artist <strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz<\/strong> it is important to reflect on dehumanization and the loss of individuality in the modern society. The artwork <strong><em>Androgyne II<\/em><\/strong> was created in 1985, during widespread food shortages. Numerous hunger demonstrations were sweeping Poland and people could not even buy even rationed foods. The demonstrations were silent and comprised of men, women, and children.<\/p>\n<p>As a reaction to the Communist propaganda which depicted happy smiling workers, she created a series of <strong>neo-expressionist sculptures<\/strong> based on fibers. <strong><em>Androgyne II<\/em><\/strong> was molded in burlap, simplified, hollowed and rendered headless and armless. The figure is carried on symbolic stretchers.<\/p>\n<p>We are still able to identify and recognize the destructed body as a human, but we cannot identify the figure specifically. The focus is on the humanity of the figure, on the suffering to which the androgyne is subjected and makes his\/her shoulders be pulled forward.<\/p>\n<p>The wrinkled skin and backbone lead us to see the person as the result of a destruction process. We are invited to think of the living process that tore apart our identities to the point of being lost and extremely vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, El Anatsui the artist behind the post-modernist artwork <strong><em>Old Man\u2019s Cloth (2003)<\/em><\/strong> provokes a discussion on the continued impact of European slave trade, exploitation of the people of Ghana and Africa in general. <strong><em>Old Man\u2019s Cloth<\/em><\/strong> is not a fiber work, even though it preserves a lot of the qualities of Kente traditional textiles that inspired it. It is made from bottle caps found in the Ghana bush to emphasize the alcohol consumption problem created by the introduction of European alcohol as part of the slave trade.<\/p>\n<p>It is gold like, just like the gold that the British extracted from Ghana until its post WWII independence. It is not precious. It is only an illusion. This illusory and precarious aspect is also suggested by the fact the \u201ccloth\u201d comes with no hanging indications and thus each exhibit curator can find her\/his own patterns. Nevertheless, the carefulness of the assembly suggests that the spirit of the nation is not broken and it can be rekindled.<\/p>\n<p>The revival of the tradition is the artist\u2019s deep hopes. He joined the Sankofa movement that re- claimed Africa\u2019s rich traditional culture.<\/p>\n<p>By trying to find meaning and hope in ugliness or discarded debris the artists expand the materials that can be used to create art and repudiate the categories of beautiful and ugly. By avoiding a clear finished state of their artworks, these artists fit into what is called \u201cbrut art\u201d. They try to provoke raw emotions and challenge the definition of acceptable human life in the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz <\/strong>was considered <strong>a pioneer of fiber-based sculpture. <\/strong>Her art was affected by her experiences in Poland, under Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II.<\/p>\n<p>Born in 1930, she lived on a large estate in Poland. Here she often played in the woods. She said this later inspired her to use natural materials in her works.<\/p>\n<p>In WWII, German tanks entered her family\u2019s estate. Later a drunk German soldier burst into the house and shot off her mother\u2019s arm in front of her. In 1944, the family fled, as the Soviet army arrived and moved into Warsaw.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Abakanowicz<\/strong> worked as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded. This would later affect her art.<\/p>\n<p>When the war was over, she attended art school at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Warsaw. Poland was a part of the Soviet Bloc. Social Realism was the style taught in art schools with smiling workers and images of a perfect society. She tried to avoid learning this style by choosing to work with textiles. Yet, \u00a0she had to adopt it to obtain a degree and enter the Polish Artist Union.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Digital Technology<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Digital technology<\/strong> provides increased access to imagery and contextual information about diverse artists and artworks throughout history and across the globe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Digital Technology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Digital technology<\/strong> provided increased access to imagery and contextual information about diverse artists and artworks throughout history and across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Today the artworld continues to expand using digital technology.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1965\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/More-Van-Vangogh.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/More-Van-Vangogh.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/More-Van-Vangogh.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/More-Van-Vangogh.jpg?resize=755%2C566&amp;ssl=1 755w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/More-Van-Vangogh.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1966\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Sunflowers.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Sunflowers.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Sunflowers.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Sunflowers.jpg?resize=755%2C566&amp;ssl=1 755w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Sunflowers.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1967\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Van-Gogh.jpg?resize=333%2C222&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"333\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Van-Gogh.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Van-Gogh.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Van-Gogh.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Immersive Van Gogh<\/em> from Italian director Massimiliano Siccardi created the work at Atelier des Lumi\u00e8res, Paris, which was featured on the Netflix show <em>Emily in Paris. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Then followed Van many other productions such as <em>Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience<\/em>; <em>Imagine Van Gogh; Van Gogh Alive, and Beyond Van Gogh Immersive Experience.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>These travelling exhibits thrilled art fans while introducing art to an entirely new audience.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(10) 238. <em>Electronic Superhighway<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Nam June Paik.

It was shot using high-speed film that achieved 300 frames per second in great detail. Viola reduced the speed of the playback to extremely slow motion. This enhances the drama. Sound amplifies the experience.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The artist wanted to create an immersive sound and video environment to dwell on transformation and change as well as growth and decay. These are inevitable processes.<\/p>\n<p>Slow-motion is not just a technological choice. It is meant to invite a meditative and contemplative response. One that requires the viewer to concentrate for longer and slows us down. This increases our awareness of movement, detail, and change. This creates a connection between the artistic and spiritual experience. We could interpret it in a religious way, even though the work makes no direct iconographic or religious overtones.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1938\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/239-On-View.jpg?resize=550%2C783&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"783\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/239-On-View.jpg?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/239-On-View.jpg?w=509&amp;ssl=1 509w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are two different video sequences that are simultaneously shown.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water + fire = duality<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the <strong>water video <\/strong>the male figure walks slowly towards the camera.

She was still a student at Yale\u2019s School of Architecture. The work was made for a public design competition. Her professor had assigned this as a project for his students. (Meanwhile, she only received a B+ grade on it from the professor!)<\/p>\n<p>Her design was one of over 2,573 submissions, in response to a call for entries by the US government.<\/p>\n<p>The idea came from the Yale Memorial Rotunda. Alumni who had been killed in war have their names inscribed on the walls. She used to touch the names and feel contemplative.<\/p>\n<p>She did not do any specific research on the war because she felt politics had eclipsed the veterans. She wanted the focus to remain on the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>The Vietnam War was a disaster on all counts. Most Americans believed the war was a moral tragedy. All of America knew it had been lost. Most opposed to the war did not blame the soldiers but the government, although some did attack soldiers or disrespect them upon their return. The vets were angry with the lack of respect and distraught about the great loss.<\/p>\n<p>The average age of names on the wall is 19.<\/p>\n<p>Life expectancy for a US soldier upon putting their boots on the ground in Vietnam was 1 month.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Vast Criticism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Lin was resoundingly criticized for this work.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>black color <\/strong>was said to not match with the rest of the US Mall. It was called \u201cblack gash on Mall\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>People interpreted the color black as a symbol of shame and dishonor over the war. Lin meant it as a sign of mourning. Additionally, black was seen as a color in Asian art, and was not typical in American, Western, or classical art&#8211;that color would have been white.<\/p>\n<p>The work was considered <strong>nonrepresentational and not traditional<\/strong>.\u00a0 It lacked ornamentation and did not follow traditional funerary sculpture. Many thought the design was too simple and did not depict honor and sacrifice in a traditional way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>War veterans wanted a traditional and realistic sculpture<\/strong>. One is added off to the side to assuage concerns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1956\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Different-View.jpg?resize=500%2C382&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Different-View.jpg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Different-View.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1957\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Sculpture.jpg?resize=500%2C328&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Sculpture.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Sculpture.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Sculpture.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/225-Sculpture.jpg?w=1458&amp;ssl=1 1458w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>People wondered why a young Asian American woman from an Ivy League college who did not know the realities of war was the artist. Why would she be picked to design a monument about deaths in an Asian war?<\/p>\n<p>Building permits were refused. It took a 4 Star Brigadier General to testify before subcommittee hearings and defend the color before the project moved forward.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Maya Lin<\/strong><em> said, \u201cIt took me 9 months to ask the VVMF, in charge of building the memorial, if my race was an issue. It had never occurred to me that it would be, and I think they had taken all the measures they could to shield me from comments about a \u201cgook\u201d designing the memorial. I remember reading the article that appeared in The Washington Post referring to \u201cAn Asian Memorial for an Asian War\u201d and I knew we were in trouble.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>She continued by saying<em>, \u201cThe controversy exploded in Washington after that. Ironically, one side attacked the design for being \u201ctoo Asian,\u201d while others saw its simplicity and understatement, not as an intention to create a more Eastern, meditative space, but as a minimalist statement which they interpreted as being non-referential and disconnected from human experience. This left the opinion in many that the piece emanated from a series of intellectualized aesthetic decisions, which automatically pitted artist against veterans. The fact that I was from an Ivy League college and had hair down to my knees further fueled this distrust of the design and suspicions of a hippie college liberal or aesthetic elitist forcing her art and commentary upon them.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(10) 240. <\/strong><em><strong>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao<\/strong><\/em><strong>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Frank Gehry (architect).

There is a bending and twisting of traditional styles to create a new aesthetic. This creates an unstable environment with unusual spatial arrangements. It looks bulging, warped, curling, tumbling. This is surprising to us because the look of the building disrupts our assumption that architecture is inherently stable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gehry<\/strong> described this work as \u201cform follows fantasy\u201d. It is a non-traditional building in both design and materials. He used a computer program called Catia, originally invented for aerospace engineering to design buildings.<\/p>\n<p>The shiny titanium tiles that sheathe the building give it strength and shine. The look was inspired by the scales of fish. The fishing industry\/shipbuilding industry was once a major part of Bilbao\u2019s economy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This building was constructed to serve as <strong>a museum of modern and contemporary art.<\/strong> The Guggenheim collection in NYC was too large for their space.

It also takes design cues from the Italian Baroque style of drapery and fabric, with bending, rippling, and unfurling.<\/p>\n<p>Notice how the building looks like a ship. It is set by the water. The reflective quality of the building was intended to show the glittering water and sun\u2019s reflection.<\/p>\n<p>The<em> Spider <\/em>sculpture in front is entitled \u201cMaman\u201d by Louise Bourgeois. It means mother in French and was designed to show vulnerability, lightness, negative space.<\/p>\n<p>The architect wanted to remove historical references. Most museums were done in variants of Neoclassicism \u2013 stone structures with pedimented fronts, colonnades, lofty and rational spaces.<\/p>\n<p>The layout was an arrangement to focus on a central atrium with the 165-foot entrance.\u00a0 This serves as a circulation hub and orientation gallery, providing access to the other 20 galleries on three levels.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition spaces have surprising shapes and does not follow the white cube method. Instead, it uses angled or curving walls and balconies. It is a complex and somewhat chaotic interior, with twisting glass-and-steel walls. It does not follow traditional Neoclassical design.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1962\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-Shot.jpg?resize=500%2C319&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-Shot.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-Shot.jpg?resize=1024%2C653&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-Shot.jpg?resize=768%2C490&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-Shot.jpg?w=1412&amp;ssl=1 1412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1964\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?resize=500%2C250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?resize=2048%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Another-View.jpg?w=1980&amp;ssl=1 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The building was very well received and the benefit to local economy was immediate and substantial.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao<\/em><\/strong> was part of an ambitious urban renewal program to help the aging port and industrial city that had experienced significant decline in the 1980s.<\/p>\n<p>Geographically, the location provided cheap land for a major museum, as opposed to a thriving European or American city. <strong>Deconstructivism\u2019s fragmented forms<\/strong> represented uncertainty of contemporary life, like the downfall of Soviet Union the Berlin Wall and the 1987 stock market.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1959\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-2.jpg?resize=480%2C279&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-2.jpg?w=363&amp;ssl=1 363w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-2.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1960\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-3.jpg?resize=334%2C433&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-3.jpg?w=334&amp;ssl=1 334w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-3.jpg?resize=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1961\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-4.jpg?resize=347%2C425&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-4.jpg?w=347&amp;ssl=1 347w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240.-4.jpg?resize=245%2C300&amp;ssl=1 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Late 20th Century\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &hellip;
