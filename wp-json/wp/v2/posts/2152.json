As part of the collection of Sir David Percival, they received the eponymous title! Sir Percival was known to possess a vast collection of Chinaware. He bought 1500 pieces of china during the Chinese Civil War, in the early 20th century, from Dowager Empress Cixi. She sold them to gain funds for the war.<\/p>\n<p>The pair of artifacts <strong>exhibit a far eastern and middle eastern merger<\/strong> concerning the shape and the motifs they manifest. The viewer should deliberately focus on this aspect of <strong>cultural exchange<\/strong>. At the same time, they have an inscription on the neck, which stands out vividly. The inscription mentions the name and date of the artifact.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The two David Vases are <strong>identical with similar forms, colors, and materials<\/strong>. Made from porcelain, they are supposedly denoted to the deteriorated versions made in bronze, which was prevalent in the 13th and 14th centuries.<\/p>\n<p>The identical vases possess the shape of an elongated vase with a handle on the neck above the shoulder. The form has a cylindrical base that tapers inwards to acquire a balanced grip on the ground. Above the same, two moldings create initial lower sections. The main body of the vase forms an arch near the shoulder, which concludes with molding. The elongated neck, a bit lesser than the length of the main body, joins to the thick rim, forming the head of the vase. The <strong>handles are shaped in the form of an elephant head and trunk on both sides.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2170\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/204-Close-UP.jpg?resize=643%2C459&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"643\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/204-Close-UP.jpg?w=311&amp;ssl=1 311w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/204-Close-UP.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The artisans, maintaining the minimalistic approach, have used <strong>blue pigment on the white porcelain<\/strong>. The <strong>design <\/strong>of the vases is a <strong>blend of animals and decorative foliage<\/strong>. The lower cylindrical body is divided into equal sections comprising <strong>symbolic motifs.<\/strong> The following section displays <strong>floral motifs<\/strong> while the main body has a <strong>single dragon<\/strong> with an undulating body covering the entire circumference. Following the molding with a decorative pattern, the first section has the form of <strong>a flying phoenix amidst clouds.<\/strong> Divided by protruding partitions, the upper neck section has a pattern of successively repetitive vertical leaves. The head of the vase shows alternating floral motifs with foliage.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>The David Vases<\/em><\/strong> do not have a special function to serve because they were for the altar of a Daoist temple. However, they have a vivid inscription at the cusp of the shoulder and the neck above the band of the dragon. The inscription mentions the name of the official who commissioned these elegant pair of blue and white Chinese wares.<\/p>\n<p>Porcelain was used to create the initial vases. They were then painted with blue pigment. Artists deglazed at the end, thereby increasing the longevity of the pigments. This process is called underglaze. Hence, the vases are still intact and continue to gleam the space.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Although the material of porcelain indicates the Chinese traditions, the visual elements are borrowed from the Middle eastern regions of art. The middle east Mesopotamia zone was an artistic hub that created many copper-inlaid-with-gold vases. The designs, apart from arabesque, also had human figures and inscriptions, which served as a document to the history of the ware. Hence, these traditions seemed to have penetrated in Chinese workshops with the Mongol invasion. The kingdom of Mongols had expanded over nearly all of Asia.<\/p>\n<p>China was the lead producer of porcelain, and hence the products were typically known as chinaware. And, as it appears, the blue and white porcelain products are quintessentially Chinese. Some of the kilns made by China could reach 2200 Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Because of the easy to read and distinct inscription, we know that these vases were commissioned by Zhang Wenjin of Yushan county in 1351. Along with <strong><em>The David Vases<\/em><\/strong>, he also presented an incense burner to a Daoist temple in Xingyua (modern-day Wuyan county).

This stimulated an enormous amount of exchange in art, culture, and commerce between the Yuan dynasty of China and the Ilkhan empire of Iran. The blue pigment or cobalt in chinaware was imported from the Iranian Ilkhan empire. At the same time, the form of the vases also reflects a similarity with the bronze vases, which was a popular art activity in the middle east.

This was a blend of traditional Chinese painting with the Western use of perspective and optical illusion (<strong>trompe l\u2019oeil<\/strong>). This was a testament to the emperor\u2019s patronage of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian artist who was paid to come in and paint.<\/p>\n<p>The small pavilion was equipped with a stage and surrounded with bamboo fence.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>Ming<\/strong> in Ming Dynasty means <strong>brilliant<\/strong>. It is meant to be a brilliant return to the past.<\/p>\n<p>The construction of the Forbidden city was the result of a scandalous coup plotted by Zhu Di (soon to be Yongle emperor). Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son\u2019s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).<\/p>\n<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.<\/p>\n<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.\u00a0 The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists. Later it was liberated by Mao as a symbol of dynastic overthrow and the new Communist state of China<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Forbidden City Imperial Power and Authority<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>How can we attribute the art-historical period during which the <strong>Forbidden City<\/strong> was constructed? How do both the plan and the architecture demonstrate the culture and\/or patron&#8217;s function and\/or purpose of the structure?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Forbidden City <\/strong>designates the Beijing palace of the Chinese emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties who ruled China from the 15th century until the early 20th century<strong>. <\/strong>The planning of the imperial palace took place during the reign of the 3rd Qing Emperor Yongle and it was done according to the Chinese traditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The city was rectangular<\/strong> just like the world according to Chinese traditions and its name \u201cPurple City\u201d corresponded to the central star of the Chinese sky the \u201csmall purple star\u201d (the Western Polar star).<\/p>\n<p>The plan and the architecture of the city <strong>reflect the ideal cosmic order in Confucian ideology<\/strong>. The imperial palace was planned on a north-south axis, with a parade avenue which crossed the whole city and connected the gates. The first two gates, the Meridian and Supreme Harmony Gates open to courtyards. The palace rules emphasized the segregation according to rank to <strong>underline the authority of the emperor.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Meridien Gate had 5 Portals:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The central gate was reserved for the emperor.<\/li>\n<li>The other middle gates were reserved for family and officials<\/li>\n<li>The outermost gates were used for servants.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>second courtyard leads to three halls<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>the Hall of Supreme Harmony, <\/strong><\/li>\n<li>the Hall of Central Harmony, and<\/li>\n<li>the Hall of Protecting Harmony.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These halls belonged to realm of state affairs and were reserved to men. They are elevated on a monumental three-tiered white marble terrace. Their tiled roofs are two-tiered and their wooden eaves are painted in intricate patterns all demonstrating the power and authority of the emperor. The <strong>roofs are yellow which is the imperial color<\/strong>. Their ridges are <strong>decorated with animal ornaments and heavenly guardians<\/strong> and the more important the building, the greater the number of clay figures.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>roof of the Hall of Harmony is crowned with two huge dragon ornaments<\/strong> weighing almost 4 tones each. Here is where the dragon throne was located. The <strong>dragon symbolized the power of the emperor<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The three Halls are the last buildings in which officials had access. The rest of the city was reserved for the imperial family, which earned it the nickname of <strong>Forbidden City. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The segregation from commoners and officials was complete and <strong>emphasized the divine role and duty of the emperor<\/strong>. Symbolically the outer South court represented Earth, and the inner Northern court represented Heaven. Only the Emperor as the Son of Heaven and could mediate both worlds.<\/p>\n<p>The main palaces of the private quarters, the emperor\u2019s Palace of Heavenly Purity, Hall of Union and empress Palace of Earthly Tranquility are also elevated. Most have two-tiered roofs and intricate caisson ceilings. The <strong>symbolism of the dragons<\/strong> continues in the inner court with the Nine Dragons tiled screen of the retired emperor palace.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>grandeur of the inner court surpasses the one of the outer court<\/strong>. The Palace of Heavenly Purity was so large and inconvenient for daily life that after Kangxi, the emperors chose to reside in a smaller Hall quoting their filial piety towards the greatest of the Chinese emperors.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 212. <em>Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Based on an oil painting by Liu Chunhua.

The plan backfires tremendously<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution of 1966<\/strong> continued for a few more years as a reaction to Mao realizing he was on the brink of losing power. Mao tried to turn frustration towards him into frustration towards the traditions of Chinese culture. Mao argued that his plan would have worked had it not been for Chinese traditions that stood in the way.<\/p>\n<p>Mao mobilized peasants <strong>(Red Army)<\/strong> and together <strong>they tortured<\/strong> traditional artists, scholars, and professors, while they <strong>destroyed <\/strong>thousands of books, historical objects, and artworks (<strong>anything Confucian or Buddhist they could get their hands on).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mao encouraged artists to create \u201cart for the people\u201d that would convey communist ideas in ways accessible to the masses. Realistic images of workers, soldiers, and peasants began to replace traditional ink\/silk images of landscapes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Liu Chunhua\u2019s<\/strong> image was painted in 1969 in the middle of the Cultural Revolution.

Initially, historians believed this to be the sole purpose. Objects that were important in life were taken to the grave, but these crowns were also used in special and occasional <strong>ceremonial rites<\/strong> of the Silla royalty.<\/p>\n<p>Silla used <strong>shamanistic practices<\/strong> in their ceremonies where Kings and Queens were significant players. The gold indicated the power of the wearer. A crown is also a visual marker of status.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Symbols and Meanings<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke a sacred tree that once stood. It is believed to be an <strong>axis-mundi. <\/strong>Jade ornaments symbolized ripe fruit hanging from the tree branches as <strong>fertility and abundance. <\/strong>The antlers symbolized the power and speed of a deer. It is a sacred animal in Korea.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the 5<sup>th<\/sup> and 6<sup>th<\/sup> centuries, Korea was divided into three kingdoms, with the <strong>Silla kingdom<\/strong> being the most powerful and wealthiest of all three.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced <strong>shamanism<\/strong>. This is a type of nature worship which requires the expertise or mediation of a figure called a shaman who can facilitate communication between the gods and people. In shamanism gods control nature. Humans are at the mercy of nature. The shaman intervenes on behalf of the people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Glitter of Gold<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as <strong>a country of gold<\/strong>. Silla kings began to associate with gold and use it to identify royalty.<\/p>\n<p>Silla was particularly famous for its craftsmen and items created out of gold. Through collections unearthed in Silla tombs historians have determined that kings and queens lived in large royal palaces, and wore robes of pure silk embellished with gold, as well as <strong>belts and crowns of solid gold<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2175\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Korean-Royalty.jpg?resize=388%2C521&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Korean-Royalty.jpg?w=388&amp;ssl=1 388w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Korean-Royalty.jpg?resize=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Jewelry was part of the ensemble with <strong>earrings, rings for every finger, and armloads of bracelets<\/strong> crafted in gold. Royalty sat down to lavish meals that were served in <strong>gold and silver vessels<\/strong> and plated on <strong>gold plates<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>earliest golden objects<\/strong> unearthed were in the Wolseng-ro Tomb in Gyeongju. It was constructed in the last quarter of the fourth century. <strong>Two large pendants were found<\/strong> made of pure gold. At the top are gold hoops, from which fall long chains, embellished with delicate pieces of gold. Historians believe these were hung from a headband on either side of the forehead.<\/p>\n<p>Later, <strong>six royal mound tombs provided further insight into the lives of the Silla royals<\/strong>. Dating back to the early Silla period, between the first quarter of the 5<sup>th<\/sup> to the first quarter of the 6<sup>th<\/sup> century the tombs each contained a royal golden crown. Hwangnam Daechong, a tomb measuring 80 meters in diameter had a crown with a matching belt, necklaces, rings, earrings, and vessels all made from gold. The fact that royal deceased were buried with the gold objects shows the high regard the Silla people had for the precious metal.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Two Types of Crowns<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Two types of crowns were discovered.<\/p>\n<p>The first is the <strong>conical cap<\/strong> (magwan), a small hat worn over a topknot. Originally, these were made of birch wood and crafted into a cone shape. Conical caps were worn on the head and strapped below the chin. Fine silk fabric was placed over top, with precious metal objects attached. These crowns did not survive, but the ornamentation did, allowing for historians to reconstruct what the crowns would have looked like.<\/p>\n<p>The southern mound at Hwangnam contained a magwan made of silver and gilt bronze. There were also decorative elements to adorn it including a gold winged object, measuring just over 16 inches high and gold rectangular plates with discs of gold circles hanging from wires. Each of the rectangles measure just over 3 inches each. \u00a0While nearby at the Geumgwachong Tomb or Gold Crown Tomb, a golden magwan crown was unearthed, measuring 7 inches high.<\/p>\n<p>The second type of crown is the <strong>daewag or headband<\/strong> style from which vertical elements hang down. These crowns are made from thin gold sheets and lined with fabric, to provide the skin with comfort. In the early stages the daewag was made of a high purity gold with a minimum of decoration. Later the crowns became highly decorative but were crafted from lower purity gold.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Belts<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Gold belts were another symbol of Silla royalty. These were crafted from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leather bands<\/li>\n<li>Gold plaques<\/li>\n<li>Pendants<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The plaques were linked together and contained engravings of dragons, phoenixes and palmettes. Heart shaped gold charms were attached to the plaques.<\/p>\n<p>Pendants also held charms such as knives, tweezers, medicine bottles, fish, and jade pieces.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0More About Royalty: Queen Seondeok&#8217;s Reign in Silla Korea <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Under the Reign of Korean\u2019s First Female Sovereign Silla Experienced a Flourish of Arts and Science<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The ancient Kingdom of Silla was ruled by a woman from 632 to 647 CE. Her name was Queen Seondeok, and she was Korea\u2019s very first female sovereign.<\/p>\n<p>The queen\u2019s father King Jinpyeong ruled for an impressive 53 years between 579-632 CE. He had no male heir, and the crown was passed on to his daughter. When she took the throne, she also took the word <strong>wang<\/strong> or <strong>king<\/strong>\u2014just like the queens in Egypt had before her.\u00a0 Seondeok was the Silla\u2019s 27<sup>th<\/sup> ruler. She inherited a prosperous fortune. Compassionately her first objective was to help the poor in the state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seondeok <\/strong>was also a fighter. She refused to give up land the Silla owned. She sent a 10, 000-man army to rescue the famous general Kin Yu-Sin. He was being held by rival King Bojang of Gogurye for ransom. \u00a0The demand was for <strong>Seondeok<\/strong> to give up territory the Silla has taken. Seeing the fierce army, the king released the general immediately!<\/p>\n<p>Silla\u2019s neighbors were not without power. The queen had already established trading and cultural ties with the Tang Court of China. The two states formed an army. Yet, warring in Korea continued until 668 CE after the queen\u2019s rule had ended.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Accomplishments<\/strong><\/h5>\n<h5><strong>Cheomseongdae<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2141\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2141\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-2141\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?resize=690%2C460&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Cheomseongdae.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cheomseongdae<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>During her time Buddhism grew increasingly popular.\u00a0 <\/strong>The queen saw an extensive building program especially when it came to Buddhist temples. While these were made of wood and did not survive, examples of stone pagodas still do.<\/p>\n<p>The most notable work is the granite built <strong>Cheomseongdae<\/strong> observatory in\u00a0Gyeongju, the Silla capital. It stands<strong> 9 meters high<\/strong>. The blocks are large rectangles set in a circular formation, forming a bottle like shape.<\/p>\n<p>There is a window with 12 layers of bricks below it and 12 layers of bricks above it. The sun\u2019s rays are captured during the spring and summer equinoxes, given its south facing views. \u00a0It was <strong>initially thought that the building functioned as a sundial<\/strong>, as astronomy and astrology were important parts of Korean society that helped with agriculture. It also lent authority to rulers as the chosen ones.<\/p>\n<p>Another theory is that <strong>Cheomseongdae <\/strong>was meant as a replica of Mount Sumeru, the holy Buddhist mountain. This would indicate the sight was a place to worship and pray. The female like form could also mean that it was built to represent the Ishtar\/Inanna who was connected to the heavens. One final theory is that it was suppose to represent the Queen herself.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Hwangnyongsa Temple<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hwangnyongsa Temple is a Buddhist temple<\/strong> which translates into English as <strong>Temple of the Illustrious Dragon,<\/strong> also in Gyeongju. Myth has it that a yellow dragon was spotted at this exact location, symbolizing the defeat of all enemies of Silla.<\/p>\n<p>The project began with the breaking of the ground by King Jinheung, in 553 CE. The site measured 280 by 280 meters, with a huge Buddha at a height of 4 meters. The queen added a nine-story pagoda for which she hired master architect Abiji from Baekje. It also included a massive bell. Everything was destroyed by the Mongols in 1238 CE, but the foundation remains for visitors to see.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Death of the Queen<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Not everyone agreed Seondeok should rule. Fuming aristocrats thought the throne should now be granted to someone outside of the bloodline. A rebellion ensued, that was thwarted by general Kin Yu-Sin and the queen\u2019s nephew.<\/p>\n<p>She would later die of illness and was entombed within the sacred mountain of Nangsan, Gyeongju.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Second Queen<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>After the rule of Queen <\/strong>Seondeok, her cousin Jindeok (r. 647-654 CE) took the throne.

Silk is a sign of <strong>status.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sin Sukju (1417-1475) is depicted as a \u201cmeritorious subject\u201d and celebrated as Prime Minister. He was an official honored for his distinguished service at court and his loyalty to the king. These types of portraits were common for government workers.<\/p>\n<p>These portraits were cherished by families and worshipped for generations. This is similar to Head of Roman Patrician with a focus on ancestral rituals.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Sin Sukju is dressed in his official robes, with a black silk hat on his head.\u00a0 He is shown as a Neoconfucian scholar. He sits with his hands folded neatly and concealed within his sleeves. Excessive fabric is a sign of wealth (think of Arnolfini Portrait!).<\/p>\n<p>He wears a rank badge on his chest that was typically made of embroidered silk. This indicates the status of the official which ranged from emperor to local official. Images of birds identified rank. Sin Sukju\u2019s badge shows a pair of peacocks amongst flowers and clouds.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Sin Sukju was Prime Minister from 1461 \u2013 1464, and again through 1471 \u2013 1475.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Imperial Bureau of Painting<\/strong> was trained to capture the likeness of sitters, while adhering to pictorial conventions for illustrating government members. Imperial Bureau was the government school of artists that standardized painted images. Since images were so standardized, artists likely specialized in one area such as the face, hands, or robe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sinification<\/strong> refers to the diffusion of Chinese culture to other regions.
