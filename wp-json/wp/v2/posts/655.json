Here the wealthy Florentines could afford to support artistic careers. The most powerful family were the Medici clan, who were bankers and rulers of Florence for more than 60 years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cosimo the Elder,<\/strong> founder of the <strong>Medici dynasty<\/strong> spent gigantic amounts of money to beautify Florence with stunning architecture and artworks. His grandson Lorenzo the Magnificent continued supporting the arts. The powerful <strong>Pazzi family,<\/strong> another banking clan, were long time rivals of the Medici family. Both did anything for prestige and to help hide their corruption.<\/p>\n<p>This competition extended to the art world and kept artists and architects both continually and gainfully employed. It also helped to show their piety to the church. This artistically rich feud between the two families ended after <strong>The Pazzi Conspiracy, in 1478<\/strong>, when the Pazzi family were tossed out of Florence.<\/p>\n<p>Other Italian city-states would follow the Renaissance movement, including Rome, Milan, Venice, Bologna and Ferrara. From Italy, it travelled to France and then onward to western and northern Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The movement first expanded to other Italian city-states, such as Venice, Milan, Bologna, Ferrara, and Rome. Then, during the 15th century, Renaissance ideas spread from Italy to France.\u00a0 The war between the two countries sparked an interest in Renaissance art! Greater trade between Italy and the rest of Western Europe increased it further.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Republic of Florence and David<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the 14th century, Italy consisted of independent city-states geographically centered on a major city. As a wealthy but small city-state, <strong>the Republic of Florence identified with David<\/strong>, from the Hebrew Bible. Florence perceived itself as an underdog standing against the larger forces of tyranny, paralleling itself with the account of David and Goliath from the Hebrew texts.<\/p>\n<p>In this story,<strong> Israel was at war with the Philistines<\/strong>, and it was common practice to send a representative warrior from each side out to battle instead of risking both armies in battle. The <strong>Philistines sent out their champion, Goliath,<\/strong> who was over nine feet tall. He intimidated the army of Israel and <strong>all warriors refused to fight him, except David, a young boy at the time<\/strong>. Refusing to use the king\u2019s armor and weapons, David instead used a slingshot, hurling a stone directly into Goliath\u2019s forehead and killing him. David then used Goliath\u2019s own sword to sever the giant\u2019s head.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donatello\u2019s bronze<em> David<\/em><\/strong>, thought to be the first freestanding nude since antiquity<strong>, first occupied the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici, home of the Medici family<\/strong>. As Florence\u2019s cultural leaders, the Medici gathered around themselves the city\u2019s foremost intellectuals, literati, and artists.<\/p>\n<p>For the Medici, artistic patronage was propaganda, similar to that of Rome and Augustus. It was used to articulate and negotiate political power and to craft a public persona. As patrons, the Medici were unmatched. They sponsored numerous public and private works, cementing their image as benevolent benefactors and guardians of Florence&#8217;s cultural patrimony.<\/p>\n<p>David stands naturally, in relaxed contrapposto, his foot resting on the severed head of Goliath with the enormous sword supporting him like a staff. Donatello departed from current convention and sculpted David nude, like a young Eros instead of a Christian hero. His extreme youth correlates to the biblical story but departs from classical forms of heroism of a more muscled, less sensuous body.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-494\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/69-David.jpg?resize=298%2C509&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/69-David.jpg?w=195&amp;ssl=1 195w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/69-David.jpg?resize=176%2C300&amp;ssl=1 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The classically inspired nudity theoretically alludes to David\u2019s refusal to wear armor.<\/p>\n<p>By adopting and displaying such a popular civic symbol, the Medici identified themselves with the city of Florence, which they indirectly sought to rule.

This, coupled with Brunelleschi&#8217;s broad knowledge of mathematics and engineering, informed his distinct, classicizing style, which emphasizes simple, clean lines, geometric forms, and harmonious proportions. There are square bays in the side aisles leading to rectangular chapels. The nave is two modules wide; the crossing, sanctuary, and each arm of the transept are perfect squares\u2014two modules by two modules.

Both were interested in a revival of the classics. Yet, it isn\u2019t apparent which member of the family requested the sculpture.The work was mot for public viewing.\u00a0 It could however,\u00a0 be viewed from the street through the opening gate to the Medici courtyard and home. This biblical subject was used to achieve political motives of the Medici.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Battle Between Florence and Milan <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In 1428, there was a great battle between Florence, a mercantile republic, and Milan, a military autocracy. The Florentines were not expected to win, but they did. As the underdogs, they claimed God was on their side.While Florence might have been a republic in name, the Medici clan actually ruled Florence. They placed multiple family members and allies in governmental positions. while ruling the city corruptly.Henceforth, the Medici family began to affiliate themselves with the biblical figure David.\u00a0 In the Bible, David is a king, with a long rule, who is enormously wise. The symbolism was David represented Florence, which equalled the Medici family. In opposition, Goliath was Milan and the Duke.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Appropriation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Florence ousts the Medici and uses the same political metaphor against them. Once the Medici clan was exiled, Florence, city officials took the statue of David and moved it to the city hall.The family were absent between 1494-1512. After, when they returned to retake the city, they did not pretend to be a republic anymore. They became an autocracy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of David<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the Old Testament David, is a young Hebrew shepherd, who slayed Goliath, with a simple sling shot.\u00a0 He was the only one brave enough. David knew he could do it, with God\u2019s help.Donatello picked that moment in the story to portray his triumphant David. The emphasis is not on bravery, but rather on success.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>David\u2019s stance is nonchalant, jaunty, and assured though his head is lowered to suggest humility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Right hand<\/strong>: holds Goliath\u2019s own sword&#8211;notches have been nicked out of it from many battles and it is rough bronze.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Left hand<\/strong>: holds a rock used to slay Goliath<\/li>\n<li>David stands on Goliath\u2019s decapitated head as a sign of total supremacy.<\/li>\n<li>David wears a soft hat, rather than a helmet like we might expect, and boots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Why is David Nude?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Many have asked this question. Surely, David was not nude when he defeated Goliath. This is <strong>Heroic nudity<\/strong> in art. It implies morality, truth, and virtue. David is not considered a \u201ctrue nude\u201d however. He still wears a hat and boots!Does this nudity also lead to some eroticism? Are there homoerotic overtones? Or is this depiction of an adolescent just typical for the time?David is something of an androgynous figure. David\u2019s body is that of an adolescent \u2013 not really a boy but certainly not a man yet. There is a softness, and an emphasis on the curvature of his body. The delicacy of his hat emphasizes an effeminate nature about him. The feather from Goliath\u2019s helmet actually runs up David\u2019s leg to touch his buttocks.<\/p>\n<h5>The Sculpture in Context<\/h5>\n<p>This work was created as a result of the classical revival\u2019s interest in humanism.For 1,000 years, since the fall of Rome, the Christians had looked at the soul, as the focus of what art should be about. The body was seen as a source of sin and it was not to be celebrated. This was the source of original sin. Think Adam and Eve in Garden of Eden.Returning to the ancient Greek and Roman love and respect for the body was now viewed as radical. This was the first life sized, freestanding, bronze, nude sculpture since antiquity.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Donatello<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Florentine artist, Donato di Niccol\u00f2 di Betto Bardi,(1386-1466) known as Donatello, was a master in sculpture using both marble and bronze. <strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Donatello is best known for <strong><em>David<\/em><\/strong>, but other famous works include <em>Equestrian Statue of Gattamelate, Penitent Magdalene, <\/em>and<em> Saint George.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 67.

Christ appears like a naturalistic, normal baby. Gone are the Gothic like depiction of him as an old-man baby.The backdrop is a seashore, with rocks and land indicating the safe haven of the church.

Vasari, the first art historian and 16<sup>th<\/sup> century Renaissance painter, wrote about Lippi in his book Lives of Artists. <\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>It is said that Fra Filippo was so lustful that, he would give anything to enjoy a woman he wanted it he thought he could have his way. If he couldn\u2019t buy what he wanted, then he would cool his passion by painting her portrait. <\/em><em>His lust was so violent that when it took hold of him, he could never concentrate on his work. Because of this, when he was doing something for Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, his main patron, Cosimo had to have Lippi locked in so he wouldn\u2019t wander off. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>One time, after Lippi had been confined for a few days, Fra Filippo\u2019s amorous, or rather animal, instincts, drove him one night to seize a pair of scissors, make a rope from his own bedsheets and escape through a window to pursue his pleasures for days on end!<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Vassari continues he story by saying that at a certain point Cosimo just had to give in and learn to treat the painter with respect. The prevailing attitude was that art was created by a skilled worker. Cosimo learned that the artist had to be inspired to create.And Lippi continued to be inspired.<\/p>\n<p>He painted an alter piece for the nuns of St Margherita in Prato.There, he saw a beautiful nun named Lucrezia Buti. He abducted Lucrezia and kept her in his house, despite the nuns\u2019 attempts to get her back.<\/p>\n<p>Lucrezia inspired the images of his female figures, with her pale alabaster soft skin and strawberry blonde hair. The image of Mary in <strong><em>Madonna and Child with Two Angels<\/em><\/strong> is based on her.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Fra Filippo Lippi<\/strong> <strong>(1406-1496)<\/strong> was born in Florence. In 1420, he was registered to the Community of Carmelite friars of the Carmine in Florence. He took his vows at age 16. The prior noting that the teen loved to draw in his notebooks, allowed him to learn to paint.\u00a0 Soon after, the budding artist tried to quit the order, but the request was denied.\u00a0He was appointed to work for a convent and then a rectory.<\/p>\n<p>He continued to paint, but it is rumored that the money he received was spent on women. It is also rumored that Lucrezia Buti bore him a son. The son was named Fillippino Lippi. While he too would become a famous painter, who his mother may have been was never certain.<\/p>\n<p>Filippo Lippi died while working on the frescos in the asp of Spoleto Cathedral. Fillippino completed his father\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 72. <em>Birth of Venus<\/em><\/strong><strong>Sandro Botticelli. Italian. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>1484-1486. 15<sup>th<\/sup> century.

This pose involves Venus covering up her breasts and hips.<\/p>\n<p>Botticelli would have seen these sculptures through his patrons, the Medici, who owned a number of classical sculptures of Venus. Despite being based on classical sculptures of Venus, Botticelli\u2019s version has unusual dimensions.<\/p>\n<p>She has <strong>elongated portions<\/strong> in her neck, left arm, and torso. Her <strong>serpentine pose<\/strong> is gravitationally impossible, The figures around her float, without anchor to the ground. In fact, they do not give of shadows.<\/p>\n<p>The landscape is flat. The waves are v shaped. There is a great emphasis on pattern, from the flowers free floating in the air to the left, to the flowered fabric to the right. The seashell gives a patterned look of light and dark stripes. This reminds the viewer that it is a two-dimensional work.<\/p>\n<p>Botticelli uses the technique of pushing figures forward onto a parallel plane to the picture plane, with a background behind them. This is based on ancient Greek vase painting where figures are isolated from the background. The artist emphasizes a graceful curving linearity, rather than a calm rational sense of space.

Using canvas was cheaper than wood, which allowed for much larger paintings. Canvas also withstands humidity well. Whereas wood can warp. The one drawback was that canvas was considered informal, so it was only used for non-official works. Yet, the mediums used to create this work are of a superior quality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>No documentation associated with the painting has been found. Vasari does mention this as a Medici painting in his book. It was painted for Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, the powerful head of the Medici clan, at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Historians think that the inspiration for Venice was Lorenzo\u2019s mistress Simonetta Cattaneo. She was also the mistress of his brother Giulio de\u2019 Medici!<\/p>\n<p>Both Lorenzo and Botticelli were interested in the revival of ancient myths. This work was unusual at the time, because not is the almost life-sized and nude, she is not portrayed in a biblical context. Some scholars think it was placed in a bedroom, due to its sexual nature.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Christian Interpretation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>After Savonarola\u2019s death, when a new level of religiosity spread through Florence, a Christian interpretation of this painting emerged. This made the work more acceptable at the time.

Holding her dress high, the wife gives the coy illusion of being pregnant. This is reiterated through the green color of the dress; the color is associated with fertility and symbolizes the couple&#8217;s hope that they will have children. The illusion of surface realism is seen in the folds and textures of the fabric, the wood grain, and the hair on the dog.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Arnolfini Portrait<\/strong> presents a world that is <strong>both realistic and symbolic<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Engravings<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Engraving is the process of cutting a metal surface to produce decoration<\/strong>, different from the intaglio technique known as etching because acid is not used to remove the metal from the plate. The plates were covered in ink and wiped so that the ink only remained within the carved recesses. The plate was then pressed onto paper using a press, which transferred a mirror image of the engraving. Printmakers did not have to follow the orders of a patron; decisions were determined by which images would sell. Engravings provided lightweight, relatively inexpensive devotional images.<\/p>\n<p>A devout Christian, <strong>Albrecht D\u00fcrer<\/strong> was influenced by his religious beliefs and the philosophy of Humanism. This outlook led him to combine the empirical study of nature with the mathematical relationships that expressed harmony and the ideal proportions expounded by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius and the Renaissance Italian artists who emulated him, such as Leonardo. D\u00fcrer ceased production of paintings and woodcuts in 1514 C.E. During this time, he created 13 engravings, including <strong><em>Adam and Eve<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-71\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=527%2C668&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"527\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?w=258&amp;ssl=1 258w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The figures are examples of the arithmetic ratio-based Vitruvian theory of human proportions. The figures stand in balanced contrapposto poses like classical statues, which D\u00fcrer was exposed to through graphic representations. <strong><em>Adam and Eve<\/em><\/strong> represent D\u00fcrer\u2019s concept of the \u201cperfect\u201d male and female figures.<\/p>\n<p>The symbolic representations in the engraving are like those in Northern art. The tension between the cat and mouse in the foreground represents the strain between Adam and Eve when Eve persuades him to eat the apple. The animals represent humanity\u2019s temperaments from medieval physiology: choleric, melancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The<strong> International Gothic Style <\/strong>remained dominant. There was a humanization of religious subject matter.The art of <strong>painting <\/strong>was dominated by guilds. Painters used horizontal lines and rich though disguised <strong>symbolism<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The paint that gained prominence among artists was <strong>oil paint<\/strong>, that started to be used in the late middle ages. It could imitate textures far better than fresco or tempera. Glazes in thin layers helped create a depth of colour.

Historians believe we are seeing Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife Giovanna Cenami. Arnolfini was a member of a merchant family from Lucca, Italy living in Bruges in Belgium<strong>. <\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Flemish artist <strong>Jan van Eyck<\/strong> or Johannes de Eyck <strong>(1395 &#8211; 1441)<\/strong> was considered one of the best Northern European painters of the 15th century. He perfected new and remarkable techniques with the medium. This included minute and extremely realistic depictions of surfaces and natural light.In 1422, he worked in The Hague for John of Bavaria, the ruler of Holland. Next, from 1425-1428 he was the painter for the Duke of Burgundy. When the Duke was about to take a wife, van Eyck traveled to her home in Portugal to paint her.The painter had many commissions throughout his life from religious works to portraits of courtiers, nobles, churchmen, and merchants.<\/p>\n<p>His work entitled <strong><em>Portrait of a Man<\/em><\/strong> is thought to be a self-portrait.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Another notable work by Jan van Eyck is the <strong><em>Ghent Altarpiece<\/em><\/strong>, painted with oils on 12 wooden panels.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More 15<sup>th<\/sup> Century Northern Renaissance Art <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse<\/em><\/strong>, by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, is an example of the <strong>German Renaissance<\/strong>, more precisely of <strong>Nuremberg<\/strong> because the artist masters the Renaissance perspective technique, as well as the wood printing one. His approach to printmaking is dynamic with a clearly practical orientation. At the end of the 15th century, Nuremberg was a flourishing merchant city with silversmiths, instrument makers and more. It was linked by trade with the cities of Northern Italy.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1000\" style=\"width: 762px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1000 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/The-Four-Horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse.jpg?resize=762%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"762\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/The-Four-Horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse.jpg?resize=762%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 762w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/The-Four-Horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse.jpg?resize=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1 223w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/The-Four-Horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse.jpg?resize=768%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/The-Four-Horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse.jpg?w=893&amp;ssl=1 893w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1498) by Albrecht D\u00fcrer<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Nuremberg was also an important center for the development of illustrated books, which gradually opened the city to the humanist culture. In Nuremberg, humanism of Renaissance was allied with the interest of patricians, scholars and craftsmen for science and technical innovation.The artist is clearly both a painter and a printmaker. Durer, the German Renaissance artist started as an apprentice in book workshops, among wood engravers and printers<\/p>\n<p>.<strong>In Comparison<\/strong>His artwork, <strong><em>Adam and Eve, <\/em><\/strong><em>which he made slightly later in 1504<\/em><em> (<a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/16th-century-art\/\">16th Century Art Collective<\/a>)<\/em> reflects a taste for technical innovation and engravings, doubled by a profound knowledge of human anatomy and perspective rules,.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-71\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=522%2C662&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"522\" height=\"662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?w=258&amp;ssl=1 258w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Both engravings are religious compositions treated with a naturalist and humanist touch. Compared with the gentle motion suggested by the contraposto positions of <strong><em>Adam and Eve<\/em><\/strong>, the composition of <strong><em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse<\/em><\/strong> is highly dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>Both artworks highlight the wood painting skills of the artist in the negative as one must cut away the substance of the design.<\/p>\n<p>The riders, symbolizing the Conquest, the War, the Pestilence (or Famine) and the Death marked the imagination of the Christian world. They were often represented in the Middle Ages and continued to be during Renaissance.<\/p>\n<p>In Durer\u2019s print we identify the riders by their weapons. The conquest has a bow, war a sword, and the pestilence a set of balances fluttering in disarray behind the rider. In the book of Revelation, written around 60 AD., by John, the fourth has no weapon. John only says that death\u2019s horse is pale, but Durer gives him a pitchfork and a skeletal horse. The world trembles under the horses\u2019 hooves and they unleash the cataclysm of the end of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Among the trampled is the figure of a bishop, which illustrates that like many Germans of his epoch , Durer\u2019s has an open hostility to the papacy and the clergy, and at least initially he enthusiastically welcomed the preaching of Luther.What makes Durer\u2019s print memorable is its evident naturalism and a strong diagonal movement. The four riders partially overlap. Perspective rules allow them to emerge realistically and create a black volume that advances towards the more whitish sky covering it. We can see why the reprinting of Durer\u2019s engraved plates and woodblocks continued after his death. His prints served for over a century as models for altarpiece shutters, frescoes, bas-reliefs, or stained glass.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-767\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/74-Albrecht-Durer-Self-Portrait-1498.jpg?resize=228%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/74-Albrecht-Durer-Self-Portrait-1498.jpg?resize=228%2C300&amp;ssl=1 228w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/74-Albrecht-Durer-Self-Portrait-1498.jpg?resize=780%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 780w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/74-Albrecht-Durer-Self-Portrait-1498.jpg?resize=768%2C1009&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/74-Albrecht-Durer-Self-Portrait-1498.jpg?resize=1169%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1169w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/74-Albrecht-Durer-Self-Portrait-1498.jpg?w=1757&amp;ssl=1 1757w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In true Renaissance fashion <strong>Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471-1528)<\/strong> was a master painter, printer, goldsmith, art theorist and human scholar.
