The presence of <strong>Hellenistic architecture<\/strong>, <strong>Buddhist sculpture<\/strong>, <strong>ceramic tile decoration<\/strong>, and <strong>chinoiserie<\/strong> outside of their original areas of development are each illustration of this cultural transfer.<\/p>\n<p>Many of these works were <strong>created for<\/strong> a specific <strong>religiously affiliated purpose, patron, or audience<\/strong>. They play a key role in the history of world art, serving as an example of the vast cultural interchanges that link European and Asian peoples. <strong>Ceramics, metalwork, textiles, painting, and calligraphy<\/strong> are some of the materials, processes, and techniques employed by artists in these regions and cultures. This unit illustrates the importance and influence that these different materials and techniques had on art and art making within and across cultures.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Ceramics<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ceramic arts have flourished in West Asia since the prehistoric era. Many technical advancements in this media, such as the development of <strong>lusterware <\/strong>and <strong>cobalt-on-white slip painting<\/strong>, started there. Ceramic arts were used to create <strong>utilitarian vessels<\/strong> and <strong>elaborate painted and mosaic-tile<\/strong> architectural decoration, carrying forward artistic practices explored in ancient West Asia (the Near East).<\/p>\n<p>High points in West and Central Asian ceramics include Persian <strong>mosaic tile architecture<\/strong> from the Seljuk through the Safavid dynasties, as seen in the <strong>Great Mosque of Isfahan<\/strong>, and <strong>Iznik tile work<\/strong> and export <strong>ceramics<\/strong> created during the Ottoman dynasty.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Metalwork<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Metalwork and metallurgy flourished in West and Central Asia in the creation of <strong>metal plaques, vessels, arms, armor and tack, sculpture<\/strong>, and <strong>decorative objects<\/strong> of all kinds. Islamic metalwork is widely regarded as one of the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Metal sculpture<\/strong> was an important art form in Central Asian and Himalayan Buddhist art, which created Buddhist figures in <strong>bronze, copper, brass<\/strong>, and <strong>silver<\/strong>, and often ornamented them with <strong>gilding, metal<\/strong> <strong>inlay<\/strong>, and <strong>paint<\/strong>. Metal artworks were created through various processes including <strong>casting, beating, chasing, inlaying, and embossing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Textile<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Textile forms from this region include <strong>silk-tapestry weaving<\/strong>, <strong>silk velvets<\/strong>, and <strong>wool and silk carpets<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Painting in West and Central Asia usually took three forms\u2014<strong>wall painting<\/strong>, <strong>manuscript painting<\/strong>, and in the Himalayan regions, the <strong>painting of<\/strong> <strong>thangkas, <\/strong>or large paintings on cloth, of Buddhist deities and mandalas.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Calligraphy<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Calligraphy was a prominent art form, particularly in Islamic art in West Asia where beautiful forms were created to transmit sacred texts. Calligraphy is found on <strong>architecture, decorative arts objects<\/strong>, and <strong>ceramic tiles<\/strong>, as well as in <strong>manuscripts<\/strong> written on paper, cloth,\u00a0or\u00a0vellum.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Style<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Styles of art from West Asia tend to favor <strong>two-dimensional design<\/strong>. Often highly decorative, these works employ geometric and organic forms and vegetal designs. These qualities carry over into figural works, where figures inhabit flat or shallow spaces with tipped perspectives and patterned landscapes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(7) 188.

The answer is unknown, as is the answer to how the Basin ends up in French royal hands<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Since this was likely commissioned by a wealthy Mamluk, it probably depicts specific individuals and Mamluk battles. <strong>Iconography <\/strong>is very dense and complex. It has not been interpreted much by historians and the meanings are probably lost<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>exterior<\/strong> has four figures in roundels, each on horseback. Two are hunting. One is drawing a bow and arrow. One is holding a club. These may be personifications of the different aspects of Mamluk horsemanship. There are Mamluk officials, macebearers, ax-bearers, and bow-bearers.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>bottom bands<\/strong> are registers of animals that decorate the basin.<\/p>\n<p>The common symbol is the <strong>fleur de lys<\/strong>. Ultimately this became the symbol of the French family, which may explain the use by the French, but this was also the symbol of the Mamluk sultans.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Mamluks<\/strong> were warrior slaves in Egypt who took control of several Muslim regions.

The carpet is one of a matching pair and was made when the shrine was enlarged under the reign of Shah Tahmasp, He was a very famous and popular Sufi mystic.<\/p>\n<p>This shrine was considered sacred to Safavid rulers and subjects and therefore it received many offerings. It remained at the shrine for three centuries until they were removed to England.<\/p>\n<p>Prayer carpets like these decorated the floors of mosques, shrines, and homes \u2013 anywhere prayer occurred. Muslims must pray 5 times a day, oriented towards Mecca. Prayer carpets help to unify all members\u00a0 as they pray together and create sense of community<\/p>\n<p>Carpets like these were also considered works of art and Iranian carpets were prized for their intricate designs. Carpets were sold by craftspeople across Islamic lands and into China and Europe.\u00a0 The Ardabil Carpet however attests to the great skills achieved in carpet by the people of north-west Iran in the 1530s.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who Made the Ardabil Carpet?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>It was made by a royal weaving factory, overseen by Maqsud Kashan. It is estimated that <strong>The Ardabil Carpet<\/strong> would have taken four years to make, if 10 people were working on weaving it. Men were the weavers, even though women often did the actual weaving, but \u00a0the size and importance \u201cnecessitated and required\u201d men.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Changing the Rules<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Carpet used for religious purpose are supposed to be aniconic. The Ardabil Carpet it is not! It does however have two prayer lamps designed on it. These are likely to mimic lamps found on the ceiling of this funerary shrine, which would have created visual unity between the rug and its surroundings<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet<\/strong> is full of typical Islamic designs. There are geometric patterns, florals, and vegetative designs. Such designs belong to a class known as <strong>Northwest Medallion Carpets<\/strong>, which is one of 30 classifications for Persian carpets.<\/p>\n<p>Ten colors were used in the design, and all were naturally sourced from items such pomegranates, the yellow spice saffron and indigo for the deep blue background. The white or cream shades were left naturally undyed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Northwestern Medallion Carpets<\/strong> are generally dominated by a central medallion.\u00a0 In the center of <strong>The Ardabil Carpet<\/strong> there is a gold medallion with a light blue roundel in the center, with floating open lotus blossoms. From the medallion 16 ovals circulate. Each is a different color in either red, green, or cream.<\/p>\n<p>To the left and right there are decorative lamps. Cartouches or rectangular shapes that were used for calligraphy line the borders.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-837\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/7-191-A.png?resize=398%2C552&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"398\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/7-191-A.png?w=398&amp;ssl=1 398w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/7-191-A.png?resize=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Inscription<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>At one end of the carpet is an inscription of <strong>poetry in three lines<\/strong>.

This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Comparison of the Two Carpets<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In Persia in the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century, it was not uncommon for important carpets to be woven in pairs. The Los Angeles carpet, although smaller after having had outer borders removed, is identical the Albert and Victoria carpet. The central medallion for example measures each other precisely.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that differs is the wool quality and weaving techniques in knot count, texture, and pile length. The London carpet has between 340 knots per square inch, while the Los Angeles carpet has 380 to 420 knots per square inch. Through this research the conclusion was made the rugs were not woven simultaneously, but within the same year. Some art historians believe that the Los Angeles carpet was woven first, because of the finer weave.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Historical Background<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet is <\/strong>one of the oldest Islamic carpets in the word. It is named after the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.\u00a0 This town was the home was a Sufi saint named Safi al-Din Ardabili who died in 1334. Sufism is Islamic mysticism.<\/p>\n<p>After the saint died, his followers continued to grow and expand. Then, in 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma\u2019il, seized power and united Iran, making the official religion Shi\u2019a Islam. This was <strong>Safavids dynasty <\/strong>which ruled until 1722. This was an exciting period of art in the creation of textiles (the art of the loom) and manuscripts ( the art of the book).<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that today 1500 carpets and carpet fragments exist from the Safavid period.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>UP NEXT:<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>West and Central Asia<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>500 BCE\u20131980 CE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/west-and-central-asia-7-2\/\">TOPIC 7.2 Purpose and Audience in West and Central Asian Art<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>West and Central Asia 500 BCE\u20131980 CE TOPIC 7.1 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in West and Central Asian Art The &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/west-and-central-asia-7-1\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">West and Central Asia 7.1<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,18],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1435"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1435"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1435\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2792,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1435\/revisions\/2792"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1435"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1435"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1435"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
