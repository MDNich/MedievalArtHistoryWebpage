The various kingdoms and city-states of Italy, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and France remained devoutly Catholic.

During the Renaissance, naturalistic form supported theological doctrine through images and sensations that people could recognize and identify with. This naturalism represented supreme rational order, the divine perfections of God&#8217;s universe, and rejected the sensational and arcane effects of the Mannerists.<\/p>\n<p>The Catholic Church argued that art should provide Christians a way to get closer to God, sharing the pains and sorrows of life to achieve salvation through suffering. The decree of the Council of Trent dictated requirements for producing images of veneration<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Depict true or biblical events, not false or mythical stories.<\/li>\n<li>Be sedate in presentation, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the experience.<\/li>\n<li>Be lifelike, enabling the worshipper to feel present at the event portrayed.<\/li>\n<li>Through emotional and expressive qualities, inspire not just devotion from the worshipper but the desire to emulate the spirituality and sacrifices portrayed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The decree represented the polar opposite to the Protestant understanding of prayer and communion, and following the saints was perceived by Protestants as idolatry forbidden by the Ten Commandments.<\/p>\n<p>The Counter-Reformation evolved into an aggressive propaganda campaign to combat heresy, proclaim the supremacy of the Catholic faith, and incite Protestants to return to the fold.<\/p>\n<p>That won\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<p>The Council of Trent dictated guidelines about images that could be venerated.

Just as Adam receives the spark of life from the finger of God, Matthew receives the light of divine inspiration from Christ and begins a new life as an apostle<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Ecstasy, Not Pain<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The same naturalism and theatrical characteristics seen in Caravaggio\u2019s works are found in Gianlorenzo Bernini\u2019s <strong><em>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa<\/em><\/strong>. Bernini refused to limit the work to a rigidly defined spatial setting; instead, it spills over the boundaries of the niche in the <strong>Cornaro Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria<\/strong> to integrate the viewer into the saint\u2019s vision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bernini combines sculpture, architecture, and painting<\/strong> to transform the chapel into a stage set complete with theater boxes\u2014typical of the Baroque period. <strong>Bernini&#8217;s subject, the Spanish nun Teresa of Avila<\/strong>, was selected by its patron, Cardinal Federico Cornaro, to replace a previous statue of the <em>Ecstasy of St. Paul<\/em>. Characteristic of Baroque\u2019s images of religious inspiration, Bernini depicts a vision Teresa of Avila had: an angel piercing her body with an arrow, bringing her into a painful but ecstatic communion with God.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bernini<\/strong> visualizes her experience as a metaphor for Divine Love, with the cherub replacing the fearsome angel of fire, smiling sweetly and adoringly at the swooning saint. Earlier representations of Saint Teresa\u2019s vision depict her kneeling. Here Bernini shows her collapsed backward in an expressive and emotional fashion. Framed by columns beneath a pediment and above the altar, Teresa appears like a vision herself, floating on a bank of clouds that is cleverly supported on a hidden pedestal.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2522\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Detail.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa..jpg?resize=505%2C642&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"505\" height=\"642\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Detail.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa..jpg?resize=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 805w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Detail.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa..jpg?resize=236%2C300&amp;ssl=1 236w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Detail.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa..jpg?resize=768%2C977&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Detail.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Detail: Ecstasy of Saint Teresa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Like Caravaggio\u2019s conversion painting, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa incorporates light as a metaphor for spiritual revelation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The gilded rays beaming down from above reflect natural light from a concealed window above the cornice on the back wall, a clever theatrical effect that Bernini employed frequently. Depending on the time of day, the light diffusing down the rays would bathe the scene in a heavenly, golden glow or set it to blaze with the spiritual fervor that Teresa describes in her account.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Evolving Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The design of religious spaces continued to evolve to accommodate the needs of those who ministered and worshiped in them.

The walls of the dome are thicker and heavier near the base and lighter toward the apex, where the oculus punctured the center.<\/p>\n<p>The oculus is open to the sky, and a drainage system channels any rainwater that enters away from the building. The walls were also thinned using <strong>coffers<\/strong>, which create a rhythmic pattern over the surface of the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>The base of the dome is accented with alternating rectangular patterns resembling frames and window-like openings. The walls are covered with marble veneer and are heavily ornamented with repeating squares against circles, accenting the niches where statues of the gods stood.

Oil on canvas.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Portraiture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In Northern Europe, both Peter Paul <strong>Rubens and Rembrandt<\/strong> van Rijn were fascinated by mathematics, natural history, and Classical philosophy and literature. They were sought after as portraitists and cast a lengthy shadow over the subsequent development of art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Rubens<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Rubens\u2019s<\/strong> style epitomized the exuberant and sensuous aspects of Baroque painting. Self-taught as a painter, he modeled his style on the Renaissance and antique works of Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rubens\u2019s <\/strong>interest in Classical antiquity was annotated in a Latin treatise he wrote, On the Imitation of Statues, \u201cI am convinced that in order to achieve the highest perfection one needs a full understanding of the ancient statues, nay a complete absorption in them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rubens\u2019s<\/strong> interaction with royalty and aristocracy gave him an understanding of what appealed to the wealthy. One of his royal patrons, Marie de\u2019 Medici, was a member of the famous Italian house and widow of Henry IV. She commissioned Rubens to paint a series of huge canvases remembering and exalting her career. Rubens used mythological and divine representations to elevate Medici and significant moments in her life, giving the impression that it was all divinely appointed.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of Marie de\u2019 Medici<\/em><\/strong>, allegorical symbolism is used to conclude that the marriage of Henri IV and Marie de\u2019 Medici was ordained by the gods and a cherished political match. Henri IV is seeing a portrait of his wife for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>He had not met her yet as they were married by proxy. Above is a representation of Zeus and Hera, Greek gods, looking on in approval, as Henri IV seems to be captivated by the painting. The eagle, a symbol for Zeus, and the peacock, a symbol for Hera, confirm this representation.<\/p>\n<p>Behind Henri IV is an allegorical personification of France, which <strong>Rubens<\/strong> used often in the Marie de\u2019 Medici Cycle to represent French royalty.

Except for two extended trips to Italy, he spent almost his entire professional life at the royal court in Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>When he was a young child, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s parents, who were of lesser nobility, instilled in him a religious fervor and an emphasis on the importance of a classical education. He received a traditional training in languages and philosophy before becoming a painter. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s teacher and eventual father-in-law, Francisco Pacheco, was a respected painter and an expert in the polychromy of statuary. From him, Vel\u00e1zquez acquired the habit of the direct study of nature. Unlike his teacher, Vel\u00e1zquez did not \u201cimprove\u201d upon and idealize nature. Instead, he used direct observation as way to make a more truthful image.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Las Meninas<\/em><\/strong> is an unprecedented image of family and royalty. In placing himself in the stately company, <strong>Vel\u00e1zquez <\/strong>also offers visible proof of the nobility of art. The viewer sees the child Maria Teresa attended by her maids, tutors, page, caretaker, and dog in the corner\u2014the people who would normally be accompanying the princess. It was customary in royal courts to include individuals with various physical differences, and people with dwarfism usually served as caretakers and playmates for the royal children.<\/p>\n<p>In the shadows at the left, half-hidden by an immense canvas, the painter pauses with paintbrush in hand. The subject of his work are the king and queen, the perceived viewers of this scene.<\/p>\n<p>The princess and her companions are in the room to accompany her parents, to relieve their boredom. In fact, there is a blurry reflection of their faces in the mirror at the back of the room. Or is <strong>Vel\u00e1zquez <\/strong>painting the princess instead, even though she has her back turned to him?<\/p>\n<p>Vel\u00e1zquez has turned this public representation of the royal family into a picture of the act of looking and of representing. As a picture of nobility, it is also a self-portrait. <strong><em>Las Meninas<\/em><\/strong> signifies a new way of thinking in European art, relinquishing portraiture from Classical representations and formality.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2538\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Las-Meninas.-Diego-Velazquez.-c.-1656-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas..jpg?resize=709%2C806&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"709\" height=\"806\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Las-Meninas.-Diego-Velazquez.-c.-1656-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Las-Meninas.-Diego-Velazquez.-c.-1656-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas..jpg?resize=264%2C300&amp;ssl=1 264w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Las-Meninas.-Diego-Velazquez.-c.-1656-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas..jpg?resize=900%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 900w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Las-Meninas.-Diego-Velazquez.-c.-1656-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas..jpg?resize=768%2C874&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Las Meninas<\/em>.

Her interest in floral subjects probably originated with her father, a famous botanist. As a young woman, she produced numerous still lifes of plants and fruits in a woodland setting. Often these works had a variety of snakes, toads, moths, grasshoppers, and the like, which differentiated her from the many other floral painters of the age.<\/p>\n<p>She connected still life with scientific observation and <strong>vanitas symbolism<\/strong>. At 15, <strong>Ruysch<\/strong> was apprenticed to the well-known Dutch flower painter Willem van Aelst.
