These are cloths that are printed with design. In the dying process, wax is placed on sections where the artist does not want the color to be absorbed.\u00a0 The process takes multiple steps to process a variety of colors within one design.<\/p>\n<p>The creation of batiks predates Islam. Yet batiks reached a peak when royal Muslim courts produced not only cloth but garments.<\/p>\n<p>In Islamic fashion cloth was produced with abstract and intricate design and for the most part were <strong>aniconic<\/strong>. In rare cases human and animal depictions can be found.<\/p>\n<p>The appearance of <strong>pre-Islamic mythology<\/strong> is common, however. These images include <strong>Garuda<\/strong>, the immortal bird-god, known for strength and ferocity and defeating oceans full of snakes. These <strong>serpents <\/strong>are also part of batiks, as are <strong>puppets<\/strong> shaped in human form.<\/p>\n<p>Today batiks still maintain importance. These artistic works are hung, worn, and used for wrapping the Quran.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Ceramics<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Ceramics <\/strong>are another notable artform within Islamic art. Wonderful examples are evident in both pottery and building tiles.\u00a0 Early pottery was left unglazed.<\/p>\n<p>The first examples are <strong>opaque glazes<\/strong> which date back to the <strong>8<sup>th<\/sup> century <\/strong>and emerged through the <strong>Hispano\u2013Moresque style<\/strong> in Adaluz or Muslim Spain. This type of glaze was achieved through using an <strong>opaque white tin-glaze.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hispano\u2013Moresque style <\/strong>also introduced the ceramic technique of <strong>painting in metallic lusters<\/strong>. This gave pottery pieces an iridescent glaze by using transparent or semi-transparent glaze that was activated by first heating and then cooling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hispano-Moresque style<\/strong> continued to flourish under <strong>Christian<\/strong> rule when elements from both religions appeared together in ceramic works.<\/p>\n<p>The 9<sup>th<\/sup> century brought with it works in <strong>stonepaste <\/strong>from Iraq as well as <strong>lusterware <\/strong>from Persia and Syria.

Influenced by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics artisans created tiles and vessels with floral cascades, human and animal forms.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Calligraphy<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Work in <strong>calligraphy<\/strong>, the art of writing in decorative form, took on great importance. <strong>Kufic<\/strong> is the earliest form of Arabic calligraphy and is distinct for its <strong>angular form<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Quranic verse is not the only purpose. Calligraphy is also used to <strong>inscribe poetry<\/strong>, and to illustrate both <strong>ownership<\/strong> and generous donations.<\/p>\n<p>Calligraphy is incorporated into <strong>books, art, architecture, coins<\/strong>,<strong> tiles<\/strong>, and <strong>metal work<\/strong>, in secular and non-secular forms.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Islamic painting in medieval times was dominated by two forms, <strong>book painting<\/strong> and <strong>miniatures.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Book Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Persia, Syria, Iraq<\/strong>, and the <strong>Ottoman Empire<\/strong> sparked a growth in the use of <strong>Islamic book painting<\/strong> during late medieval times. \u00a0During the Ilkhanid dynasty in Persia, examples of beauteous, large<strong>, illuminated manuscripts <\/strong>emerged.<\/p>\n<p>During the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century <strong>manuscript paintings<\/strong> were influenced by the Byzantines and Mongols. Mongols was the generic term for a group of people comprised of both Mongolic and Turkic tribes of the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maquamat<\/strong>, the plural form of <strong>Maq\u0101ma<\/strong>, is an early medieval text and type of literary genre. It illustrated the day-to-day life of the people of the time. It contained prose that rhymed, with snippets of spiritual poetry.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Miniatures<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Small paintings on paper, also known as <strong>miniatures, <\/strong>were an artistic tradition in <strong>Persia<\/strong>. The Mughals of India and Ottomans of Turkey also produced these artworks from which Persian artists were highly influenced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mughal<\/strong> artists were known for their realistic portraits, many of which are in profile, while <strong>Ottoman <\/strong>artists used a more stylized form. Subjects included idealized youths, animals, family, and picnic scenes, as well as works focusing on individuals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts<\/strong> were part of the court and therefore had to pertain to all the religious rules governing the elimination of human depiction. While miniatures for a more general audience enabled human form.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at miniature paintings during this time one can see the <strong>Byzantine influence<\/strong> visually. This includes work in blue and gold, as well as angelic motifs. <strong>Chinese influence<\/strong> is also apparent in the use of flowers such as peonies, as well as well as mythological creatures including phoenixes and dragons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Muraqqa <\/strong>is an album in book form combining Islamic <strong>miniature paintings<\/strong> and calligraphy from many different artists. The word Muraqqa is a Persian word that translates into \u201cthat which has been patched together\u201d. Books of this type were popular among collectors in the Islamic world.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Glassmaking\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Islamic glassmaking<\/strong> was considered <strong>a luxury art<\/strong> for the wealthy. During the Middle Ages, Islamic glass had a reputation for being the best in Eurasia and was shipped to buyers in both Europe and China. Some of the finest examples of glass from this time were found in <strong>lamps for mosques<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_831\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-831\" style=\"width: 401px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-831\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=401%2C535&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"401\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/14th-Century-Mosque-Lamp.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mosque Lamp<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Mosque Lamp<\/strong> (above) from the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century is attributed to Egypt and Syria.

On view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 454.<\/p>\n<p>During the 8<sup>th<\/sup> to 11<sup>th<\/sup> centuries glass was decorated with incised patterns or in relief, by cutting away sections of glass. <strong>Luster painting<\/strong>, which dates to 9<sup>th<\/sup> century Egypt was also popular. This was achieved with the application of metallic pigment during the glass making process. Sometimes threads of glass were created in different colored threads and then pulled into the main surface to be heated together. There are also examples of glass that has been <strong>gilded, painted, and enameled<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>By the 1500s glassmaking expertise moved on to Venice, where many orders for mosque lamps were completed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Islamic Metalwork<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The inlay technique, where pieces of softer metals (such as <strong>copper, gold, and silver<\/strong>) were inlaid into harder metals (<strong>bronze or brass<\/strong>) were used, represents a high point in Islamic metalwork of the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries.<\/p>\n<p>Initially in the 12th century it was laborious. Imagine hammering wire into tiny grooves that were previously cut into the object. These were chiseled to about 1-mm deep recesses along the pattern lines. Later in the 14th century there was a shortage of silver, hammering the inlaid designs directly onto the roughened surface. This was more economical, but the inlays peeled off easily.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Motifs and Symbols<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Fatimid era (909-1071<\/strong>)\u00a0brass vessels are simple and functional<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kufic inscriptions<\/li>\n<li>Decorative motifs showing birds, animals, geometric patterns, and vine tendrils<\/li>\n<li>No human figures<\/li>\n<li>This was forbidden according to a Koranic edict, which regards the human form in art as rivaling God\u2019s creations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Seljuq reign in the 11th-13th centuries<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the classic period or the golden age of Islamic art<\/li>\n<li>Formalized, stylized motifs departed from the aniconic Islam; free use of figures<\/li>\n<li>Metal smiths departed from the functional forms and gave their vessels animal shapes<\/li>\n<li>Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic elements were added to the Arabic script on the vessels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Mamluk rule 14th century<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elegant metal objects were made for personal use<\/li>\n<li>Ceremonial objects were inlaid with silver and gold<\/li>\n<li>Eastern motifs such as composite imaginary figures and a repertoire of vegetable and animal forms.<\/li>\n<li>The inscriptions were etched in an ornate Arabic script and framed in bands separated by medallions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>(7) 183.

For Europeans who may have encountered the city, it strategically made a good first impression.<\/p>\n<p>This was the center of the community.

Reigning the Indian subcontinent, they had immense political and feudal access to many provinces.<\/p>\n<p>The Mughals levied administrative power and their royalty had been fruitful in developing many architectural specimens. Among them, the Taj Mahal is the best work under the aegis of Shah Jahan.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Taj Mahal epitomizes the unflinching expertise and power of the Mughal dynasty that invaded India in the 15th century. The first Mughal king, Babur, during his five years tenure, promoted art and culture, <strong>bringing many Persian artists to India<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The lineage of promoting creativity was at its peak during the reign of Akbar, who promulgated the development of numerous ateliers. Many <strong>Indian, Persian, and Turkic artists<\/strong> were part of these ateliers. His son, Jehangir, and the fourth Mughal king was an enthusiastic promoter of <strong>miniature paintings<\/strong>. Similarly, Shah Jahan was also instrumental in maintaining the legacy of preserving and creating newer art forms, influencing, and being influenced by indigenous Indian art.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the famous architectural buildings by Mughal kings include Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, Fatehpur Sikri, Lahore fort, Buland Darwaza, Bibi ka Maqbara, among many others.<\/p>\n<p>With <strong>Taj Mahal&#8217;s<\/strong> accomplishment, the Mughal architecture cleverly portrays a synthesized merger of Islamic and Indian architecture.\u00a0 Glorifying his dynasty, Shah Jahan posited the Taj Mahal as a propagandist monument to eulogize self-rule.<\/p>\n<p>Many <strong>motifs from Hindu culture<\/strong> had been incorporated to present a harmonious acceptance of India&#8217;s diversity. While the <strong>onion dome denotes Islamic style<\/strong>, some plant motifs, and white marble are typically Indian.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artists and Patrons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mughals were known for extravagance, art patronage, and despotic encroachment of Indian provinces. Shah Jahan had already thought of building a Taj Mahal irrespective of Mumtaj&#8217;s untimely demise. Generally, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial under an open sky but the Taj Mahal was an exception, among the other few domed mausoleums. Situated on the bank of the Yamuna River, it allowed for easy access to water. Moreover, Agra was known as a \u201criverfront\u201d city<\/p>\n<p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad A\u1e25mad Lahawr\u012b, an Indian of Persian descent.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>five principal elements<\/strong> of the complex, which includes the <strong>main gateway<\/strong>, <strong>garden<\/strong>, <strong>mosque<\/strong>, <strong>jaw\u0101b <\/strong>(literally \u201canswer\u201d, a building mirroring the mosque), and <strong>mausoleum<\/strong> (including its four minarets) were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration.<\/p>\n<p>The building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638\u201339. The adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, the construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Purpose and Symbolic Meaning of Taj Mahal<\/strong><\/h5>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Projecting unique beauty, the <strong>mausoleum<\/strong> is a wondrous home to the couple-tombs of Shah Jahan, a Mughal King, and his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal, the name of which bestows the title to the revered tomb.<\/h5>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal king and had unrivaled authority over the Indian states. Despite having many wives, he was extremely fond of Mumtaj. Tormented by her sudden demise, he thought of building the most beautiful tomb for her. As opposed to black marble tombs in the Islamic culture, he demanded a white marble mausoleum.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, the Taj Mahal is the <strong>symbol of unconditioned love<\/strong>. Shah Jahan spent most of his time with Mumtaj, neglecting other wives. Though she was not interested, Shah Jahan confided many administrative and military decisions with her. One of the walls of the Taj Mahal has an inscription, which reveals praises for Mumtaj by Shah Jahan in the Thuluth script.<\/p>\n<p>As it is built on the <strong>raised platform<\/strong>, the concept refers to the royal status of the throne to god. Furthermore, it is an architectural <strong>metaphor for Paradise<\/strong>. Hence, the pools and gardens in the complex enhance the idea of paradise on the earth.<\/p>\n<p>Owing to the despotic rule of Aurangzeb, their progeny, who had locked his father, Shah Jahan was unable to see the completion of the building. Hence, the <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> is a <strong>symbol of compassion and royalty.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> emphasizes the <strong>power <\/strong>vested in royal Mughal patrons.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Significance of Geography <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Shah Jahan decided to build <strong>Taj Mahal<\/strong> in Agra due to many reasons. One of the reasons was the proximity of Rajasthan, a nearby state, and the vast resource of white marble for easy transportation. In addition, the building, enriched with Indian and Islamic principles, projects the idea of the greatness of Jahani rule. Technically, it glorified the Mughal rule.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Entering the Complex<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-811\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=975%2C556&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209.-Complex-Drawing.png?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Crenelated walls fence the entire complex, which opens in the south to move towards the north. A visitor first enters the forecourt or <strong>gate of red stone<\/strong>, which is an equally ornate and splendid specimen. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna river, the complex divides itself into four regions through channeled waterways. Although fenced, the fourth side opens to the river.<\/p>\n<p>The Taj Mahal is built on a square and <strong>raised platform or a plinth<\/strong>. The tomb is the epitome of the Mughal architectural method called Hasht Behesht. Particularly, Hasht Behest is an idea of <strong>eight paradises<\/strong>, rendering the plan <strong>octagonally<\/strong>. Hence, the main structure of the tomb is set in a nine-fold plan, showing eight rooms surrounding the central chamber.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-814\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=990%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209-with-labels.png?w=455&amp;ssl=1 455w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/8-209-with-labels.png?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>central chamber<\/strong> with an onion-shaped dome is <strong>flanked by four minarets<\/strong> at the four corners of the plinth.

Hence, Aurangzeb&#8217;s disinterest and disengagement led to the fall of the Mughal empire, leaving the ground for Britishers to take charge by the 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>Taj Mahal oversees millions of worldwide tourists every year. This Mughal mausoleum has also been a hotbed of political and cultural concerns, resulting in many newer rules and regulations for the visitors. Nevertheless, the penchant of Shah Jahan for erecting a wonderful tomb as a token of limitless affection is path breaking. Continuing to draw visitors to Agra to glimpse this architectural beauty, even after four hundred years, Taj Mahal continues to inspire awe.<\/p>\n<h4>(<strong>7) 187.

The carpet is one of a matching pair and was made when the shrine was enlarged under the reign of Shah Tahmasp He was a very famous and popular Sufi mystic.<\/p>\n<p>This shrine was considered sacred to Safavid rulers and subjects and therefore it received many offerings. It remained at the shrine for three centuries until they were removed to England.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prayer carpets<\/strong> like these decorated the floors of mosques, shrines, and homes \u2013 anywhere prayer occurred. Muslims must pray 5 times a day, oriented towards Mecca. Prayer carpets help to unify all members \u00a0as they pray together and create sense of community<\/p>\n<p>Carpets like these were also considered works of art and Iranian carpets were prized for their intricate designs. Carpets were sold by craftspeople across Islamic lands and into China and Europe.\u00a0 The Ardabil Carpet however attests to the great skills achieved in carpet by the people of north-west Iran in the 1530s.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who Made the Ardabil Carpet?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>It was made by a royal weaving factory, overseen by Maqsud Kashan. It is estimated that <strong>The Ardabil Carpet<\/strong> would have taken four years to make, if 10 people were working on weaving it. Men were the weavers, even though women often did the actual weaving, but \u00a0the size and importance \u201cnecessitated and required\u201d men.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Changing the Rules<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Carpet used for religious purpose are supposed to be aniconic. The Ardabil Carpet it is not! It does however have two prayer lamps designed on it. These are likely to mimic lamps found on the ceiling of this funerary shrine, which would have created visual unity between the rug and its surroundings<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet<\/strong> is full of typical Islamic designs. There are geometric patterns, florals, and vegetative designs. Such designs belong to a class known as <strong>Northwest Medallion Carpets<\/strong>, which is one of 30 classifications for Persian carpets.<\/p>\n<p>Ten colors were used in the design, and all were naturally sourced from items such pomegranates, the yellow spice saffron and indigo for the deep blue background.

It begins with:<\/p>\n<p><em>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br \/>\nExcept for this door there is no resting-place for my head.<br \/>\nThe work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Masqud was a court official in charge of producing the carpets, while the word slave, as used by Masqud may have been his way of promoting himself as a humble servant. Additionally in the Persian language, the word door can mean shrine or royal court.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>fourth line<\/strong> provides the date the carpet was created AH 946 based of the Muslim calendar. This begins in 620 CE when Muhammed fled from Mecca to Medina. There AH 946 translates into 1539-49 CE.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Comparison of the Two Carpets<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In Persia in the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century, it was not uncommon for important carpets to be woven in pairs. The Los Angeles carpet, although smaller after having had outer borders removed, is identical the Albert and Victoria carpet. The central medallion for example measures each other precisely.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that differs is the wool quality and weaving techniques in knot count, texture, and pile length. The London carpet has between 340 knots per square inch, while the Los Angeles carpet has 380 to 420 knots per square inch. Through this research the conclusion was made the rugs were not woven simultaneously, but within the same year. Some art historians believe that the Los Angeles carpet was woven first, because of the finer weave.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Background<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The Ardabil Carpet is <\/strong>one of the oldest Islamic carpets in the word. It is named after the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran.\u00a0 This town was the home was a Sufi saint named Safi al-Din Ardabili who died in 1334. Sufism is Islamic mysticism.<\/p>\n<p>After the saint died, his followers continued to grow and expand. Then, in 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma\u2019il, seized power and united Iran, making the official religion Shi\u2019a Islam. This was <strong>Safavids dynasty <\/strong>which ruled until 1722. This was an exciting period of art in the creation of textiles (the art of the loom) and manuscripts ( the art of the book).<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that today 1500 carpets and carpet fragments exist from the Safavid period.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(7) 189. <em>Bahram Gur Fights the Karg, <\/em>folio from the Great Il-Khanid <em>Shahnama.<\/em> <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Islamic; Persian, Il\u2019Khanid. \u00a01330-1340 CE.\u00a0 Islamic.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-840\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-840\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/7-189.jpg?resize=600%2C817&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"817\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/7-189.jpg?w=271&amp;ssl=1 271w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/7-189.jpg?resize=220%2C300&amp;ssl=1 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bahram Gur Fights the Karg<br \/>Reproduction print used by permission of the Harvard Art Museums<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Learning Objective: <\/strong>Mongol manuscript<\/p>\n<p><strong>Theme: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cross-cultural<br \/>\nText and image<br \/>\nPolitics<br \/>\nPropaganda<br \/>\nPower<br \/>\nAppropriation<br \/>\nRulers<\/p>\n<p><strong>Museum:<\/strong> Harvard Art Museum<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Bahram Gur Fights the Karg<\/em><\/strong><em>, <\/em>a <strong>folio<\/strong> from the <em>Great Il-Khanid Shahnama, <\/em>is a work in ink and opaque watercolor, using gold and silver on paper, measuring 8 by 5.5 inches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fun fact: <\/strong>This is real paper.

It also displayed Jahangir\u2019s legitimacy, piety, and reverence for religious deeds. Proving piety\u2019s fervor over the power, he tended to behave accordingly in terms of the rank of the individual. By staging the king on an hourglass, Bichitra had conceded a much-accepted weight to his honor. In European culture, hourglass projects the existence of calculative time. By enthroning Jahangir over the same, he disposes the ideology to the supremacy of the royal figure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Traditions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mughal art and architecture began thriving from the reign of the first Mughal king, Babur (1483 -1530). An Islamic rule, the <strong>Mughal kings were known for their opulence and extravagance<\/strong>. Due to regular trade exchange with near-east locations, Mughals generated immense wealth. Hence, they observed a long tenure in the Indian subcontinent, almost encroaching across the entire land.<\/p>\n<p>Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was a patron of arts who descended from the Timurid sultanate. To cultivate Islamic art in India, <strong>he brought Persian artists with him<\/strong>. While Indian indigenous art was enriched with many centuries of artistic expertise, the entry of Persian art resulted in the merger of forms.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, after Babur, it was Humayun (1508 -56), his son, who lived in refugee at Shah Tahmasp\u2019s, a Safavid Persian ruler in India, court and had observed many painters at work. Subsequently, he engaged in creating folios and books, which included the famous\u00a0<em>Hamzanama<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hamzanama\u00a0<\/em>is a book on the life and adventures of Hamza, who was an uncle to Prophet Mohammad. However, with the sudden demise of Humayun, Akbar (1542 &#8211; 1605), who was to be one of the great emperors of Mughal India, took the charge of art patronage. As mentioned by court historians, Akbar had <strong>hired more than 100 artists and established many ateliers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Since Akbar, the Mughal kingdom experienced a stable state for the future kings. Jahangir (1569 &#8211; 1627), unlike Akbar, was meticulous about the accuracy and anatomical details of the natural forms in the painting. Moreover, allegorical miniature portraits were a popular painting genre among Jahangir\u2019s court painters<\/p>\n<p>Although Europeans had begun negotiation since the Akbar&#8217;s reign, Jahangir accepted their desire to trade in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the increase in commerce, the European forms along with Indian and Persian began appearing in the paintings by court painters. Thus, Jahangir era paintings evolved a cross-cultural style, for political and cultural agendas.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patrons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Bichitra (pronounced Buh-Chit-truh) is the artist to\u00a0<em>Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings<\/em>\u00a0under the patronage of fourth Mughal King Jahangir, son of Akbar.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned before, Muraqqas were major projects undertaken by ateliers of Mughal kings to record their political and personal life, in some cases.\u00a0<em>Baburnama<\/em>,\u00a0<em>Akbarnama<\/em>,\u00a0<em>Tujuk-I- <\/em><em>Jahangir<\/em>, among other publications, are rich examples of the Mughal lineage of biographies. Today these documents present us with detailed data about the kings, elite officials, and political activities of the kingdom.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Establishing ateliers<\/strong>, each Mughal king had been instrumental in sustaining artists and the culture of the regions. Humayun, intending to sustain the nomenclature of Mughal art and architecture, brought two Persian artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd us Samad. The ateliers of Akbar drew many international artists to prosper in their careers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These ateliers had Hindu artists, too.<\/strong> Incorporating their scholarships, Mughal art experienced a peak period in these centuries. However, post-Shah Jahan&#8217;s, Jahangir heir era, the subsequent Mughal rulers did not bestow a keen enthusiasm in art patronage. By the 19th century, Mughal art underwent a severe downfall due to many political factors.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Indian subcontinent had witnessed many tumults of foreign invasion, which eventually affected the artistic and architectural praxis. However, the <strong>indigenous form of painting had also evolved<\/strong>, projecting a <strong>rich color palette<\/strong>, and <strong>flat background in ornate manuscripts<\/strong>. Mughal invasion, however, was to stay for a longer time, and thus it amalgamated many styles that it brought with the existing Indian ones.<\/p>\n<p>During Akbar\u2019s reign, in 1591-2, the Islamic second millennium had commenced. Being aware of solar and lunar events, the Mughals were well versed in astrology and followed the Islamic calendar. When Jahangir accepted the throne in 1605, it was already ten years past the onset of the new millennium. Hence, the hourglass, a typical European collectible, is a definite symbol of the passage of time and positing Jahangir has a messianic king.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Bichitra<\/strong> was one of the revered Hindu painters in the Mughal court. As Jahangir was a proponent of scientific accuracy and detailed approach, Bichitra was deft in his craftsmanship to create wonderful paintings. Moreover, in the case of Bichitra, symbolism and semantic ideas brim his creative compositions. Such paintings have never been attempted before Jahangir\u2019s reign.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ISLAMIC ART Theme: \u201cDivinity, infinity, and unity\u201d Islamic art is inspired by and entirely comprised of Islamic religious messages and &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/islamic-art\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Islamic Art<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[7,10,11,18],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/776"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=776"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/776\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1460,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/776\/revisions\/1460"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
