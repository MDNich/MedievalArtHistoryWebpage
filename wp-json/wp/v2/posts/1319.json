She painted almost 200 self-portraits.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Two Fridas <\/em><\/strong>was completed during her divorce from Diego Rivera.<\/p>\n<p>She married Rivera in 1929. They each had affairs. Kahlo\u2019s affairs were with men and women.<\/p>\n<p>Kahlo\u2019s father was German, and her mother was Mexican. Rivera encouraged her to abandon her Germanic\/Western heritage and wear traditional Mexican clothing instead.<\/p>\n<p>In an era when women wore elaborate hairstyles and clothing, <strong>Kahlo was a rebellious loner who wore indigenous clothing<\/strong> and did not shave. This was seen as very transgressive. During this time most women were domestic housewives. <strong>Kahlo was a businesswoman and artist.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In her paintings <strong>she often depicted physical deformities<\/strong>. She had polio as a child, which deformed her right leg. A bus accident when she was 18 caused her to be impaled through her groin which left her unable to walk for many months. Ultimately, she was unable to have children. She had severe scarring and deformity of the uterus. As a result, she underwent 32 operations. All these things challenged the definition of femininity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><em>\u00a0<\/em><strong>(4) 148 <em>Narcissus Garden<\/em><\/strong><em>.<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>Yayoi Kusama.

Each mirror ball measured eight inches across. There was a total of 1500 balls in the original <strong>installation<\/strong>. Later, she would recreate the installation around the globe in a multitude of versions and settings.<\/p>\n<p>This work is considered <strong>performance art<\/strong>. This means artwork that is a performance, time sensitive, and only preserved in photographs. In this case, viewers could see themselves and their surroundings in the work. It expressed the idea of illusion and infinity.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Based on Mythology<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The title of this work has a reference to the classics. <strong>Narcissus<\/strong> the mythological hunter, fell in love with his reflection in a pool. <strong>Narcissism<\/strong> is the egotistical admiration of one\u2019s own self.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Message<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The work was a critique of the narcissism of art world and commercialization. Monetary exchange between Kusama and her customers underscored the economic system in art production and exhibition.<\/p>\n<p>It also spoke of the pressure on artists to sell artwork, an experience, their brand, and the need for self-promotion. They must market and promote themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden<\/em><\/strong> became more and more popular. The balls became collector\u2019s items.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden<\/em><\/strong> was first installed in the <strong>Venice Biennale<\/strong>, a major contemporary art show in 1966. Yet, the artists had not officially been invited to exhibit!<\/p>\n<p>This work of<strong> performance art <\/strong>was originally on a grass lawn on which <strong>Kusama<\/strong> set 1,500 mirror balls on. She was dressed in a gold kimono. Each ball was sold for 1,200 lira ($2). There was a sign that said, \u201cYour narcissism for sale!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Venetian authorities reprimanded her and fined her.<\/p>\n<p>A<strong> happening is a term<\/strong> coined in late 1950s to describe performance art that is initially planned but <strong>involves spontaneity, improvisation, and audience participation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Yayoi Kusama<\/strong> was born in 1929. She is a self-taught artist who has now chosen to live in a Tokyo mental facility.<\/p>\n<p>She had difficulty finding acceptance in the art world as both a woman and foreigner. She also lived in a society recovering from WWII prejudice against Japan.<\/p>\n<p>Mirrors and repetition are a theme in her artwork, as she says it helps her to process her insanity. She reminds the viewer that Pop Art didn\u2019t just focus on consumer culture (celebrities, soup cans) but also on our own vanity and ego<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 151. <em>Spiral Jetty.<\/em> <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Robert Smithson.
