This sort of memory is evoked through the presentation of primordial forms such as cultural heroes, founding ancestors, or totemic animals to reaffirm shared values and important truths. In some instances, the memory is created and performed, and then the objects that appeared in those processes are destroyed, leaving a new iteration of the memory.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(9) 213.

The eye sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral. The works were once painted with red and white.\u00a0 Each statue has a heavy eyebrow ridge, elongated ears, oval nostrils, emphasized clavicle, thin arms, no hands, large forehead, and a long nose.<\/p>\n<p>The stones were quarried from mountains up above and then slid along the side of the mountain, until they landed upright in a hole. The trick was getting them to not tip forward once they were in the hole.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How were these Transported?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>first theory<\/strong> is they were moved horizontally on a sled.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>second theory<\/strong> is that they were rolled horizontally using logs.<\/p>\n<p>If you ask islanders, they say the statues \u201cwalked\u201d. This was largely disregarded by historians as being mystical or metaphorical.<\/p>\n<p>A Czech historian even tried dragging the statue along in an upright position. This damaged the statue and in effect, it ground down the bottom, like rubbing it with sandpaper. Instead, they realized you need three ropes tied to each one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Two ropes are needed on the sides and one behind<\/strong>. The two side ropes rock the statue from side to side, slightly pulling forward so it will see-saw along. The rope on the back helps to stabilize it, so it won\u2019t collapse forward or back.<\/p>\n<p>The ropes are tied where the eyes are through the deeply inset nose bridge and eye sockets. This way it can move 100 yards in 40 minutes this way and it is easier to go uphill.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Moai were carved to commemorate important ancestors. This was a display of status for both the ancestor and the patron\/relative who commissioned it. The statue embodies the spirit of the past. All moai face with their backs to the sea. In this way, they are guardians, that protect and focus on the island.<\/p>\n<p>Almost all were toppled. This was done out of frustration by locals when the statues were viewed as not protecting the island. Most have been restored to their original spots.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Statues represent ancestors deified after death<\/li>\n<li>Topknots on some statues likely represent chieftains<\/li>\n<li>The larger the statue, the more powerful the individual was<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Discovery<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Easter Island (native name = Rapa Nui) is called that because it was discovered on Easter 1722 by the Dutch.\u00a0 The island is just 10 miles long and 6 miles wide. It is one of the most isolated places on earth and extremely remote.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art Comparisons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This monumental sculpture is unique in Pacific art and more like South America. Some theorized Rapa Nui wasn\u2019t Oceanic at all, but rather Latin American. This has been disproved with genetic testing.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How did the Island Collapse?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The old theory is the island depleted its resources and completely deforested itself, causing a decline in birds and therefore a decline in food. The people toppled the moai, upset with the ancestors for not protecting the island (theory of Jared Diamond who wrote <em>Guns, Germs, Steel<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>But there is a new theory. On the first sighting in 1722, the Dutch described the island as bountiful and thriving. In 1774, Captain James Cook described the island as having human bones everywhere and being sparsely populated. The island was exposed to European diseases for which Easter Islanders had no natural immunities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(9) 222.
