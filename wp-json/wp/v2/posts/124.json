Displayed in churches, chapels, convents, palaces, and civic buildings, the arts performed various functions (e.g., propagandistic, commemorative, didactic, devotional, ritual, recreational, and decorative).<\/p>\n<p>Surviving<strong> architecture is primarily religious<\/strong> in function although though domestic architecture survives from the late Middle Ages.

Encaustic is a pigment mixed with wax.\u00a0 The work is formal and both religious and political in nature.<\/p>\n<p>As is the norm in Byzantine icons, the figures are highly contoured, and the faces are <strong>modeled<\/strong> with light and shadow to show roundness. The figures are frontal and almost rigid, yet the angels do turn their heads. The two figures in the front are floating and do not support their weight.<\/p>\n<p>The space is shallow, and background details are vague. There is however some spatial recession with shadows on the throne.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is an Icon?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Icon <\/strong>is the Greek word for image. An icon painting is for personal devotion and worship. Icons were believed to be the religious figures depicted. The steady gaze of the images encouraged a personal connection for the worshipper.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose is not to be visually accurate, but rather to convey religious meaning and facilitate a religious experience.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Figures in the Icon Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The Virgin (Theotokos)<\/strong> is the Greek title for mother of God. She is embodiment of support to Christ. Her body literally carried him, and she supports him now. Her deep blue outfit, with hood pulled over head is very typical of Byzantine art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saints Theodore<\/strong> on the left and<strong> George<\/strong>, on the right.\u00a0 They are soldier\/warrior saints and popular because they defended faith. Two angels gaze upward to the hand of God emerging from shaft of light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Christ <\/strong>appears as an old man in a baby\u2019s body to indicate he contained infinite wisdom.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Background History<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Virgin (Theotokos)<\/strong> <strong>and<\/strong> <strong>Child<\/strong> <strong>between<\/strong><strong> \u00a0<\/strong><strong>Saints Theodore and George<\/strong> \u00a0was discovered at St. Catherine\u2019s Monastery in Mount Sinai in Egypt, built during reign of Justinian in Byzantine Empire. This is the place where God appeared to Moses. This is the oldest continuously used Christian monastery.<\/p>\n<p>This work is based on Late Egyptian funerary portraiture during the Roman period. \u00a0Byzantines occupied Roman Egypt, which was affected by Pompeiian wall paintings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Iconoclastic Controversy<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>During the 8<sup>th<\/sup> and 9<sup>th<\/sup> centuries Christians regard the devotion to icons as idolatry. This simply meant people were worshipping the objects, rather than worshipping to them or using them to guide their thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>Icons became indispensable, personal mediums for spirituality and miracles were often ascribed to them. Many were fearful this was a relapse to pagan idolatry. As a direct result icons were destroyed en masse. Today, very few survive.

This was the final destination of all pilgrims because it contains the relic of St. James.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Relics as Religious Objects<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Relics are objects of religious significance. Some Christian examples directly associated with Christ\u2019s life include, <strong>the manger, the cross and Mary\u2019s clothing<\/strong>. Then, there are <strong>physical remains of saints<\/strong> such as <strong>teeth, feet, or skulls.<\/strong> Additionally, anything the saint may have touched was also considered a relic, like<strong> clothing or a bible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was believed that relics induced miracles. They could cure sickness, stop famine or plagues. This created a commerce market for relics. Forgeries abounded. So many people were selling pieces of the True Cross, that John Calvin famously remarked that you could build a ship with them.<\/p>\n<p>Reliquaries developed as ways to protect and display relics. Since relics were valuable , they were enshrined in containers that were decorated with precious metals and precious and semi precious stones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Churches were built along major pilgrimage roads<\/strong> to welcome pilgrims and show them relics\u2014both real and forged. Relics became a source of income for the church, as people made offerings. It also helped support the town in was the church was in with tourism trade.<\/p>\n<p>Today, every October, there is still a festival in Conques and the region of Southern France that celebrates Sainte Foy.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 61.

The illustrations show a priest on the left teaching a group of men. Two Jewish men identified with conical hats, turn their body away from the priest.\u00a0 This was aimed to convince Christian readers that Jews were once God\u2019s people, but medieval Jews no longer were.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Apocalypse Revelations<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Apocalypse is last book of the Christian bible, often called Revelations. It details evil being destroyed by God, with the righteous being raised. It also describes the end times.<\/p>\n<p>People in the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century and High Middle Ages believed that the end times had come. War. Plagues. Violence. As such, the book of revelations became extremely popular.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Blanche of Castile was the Queen of France and married to Louis VIII. The couple gave birth to Louis IX. \u00a0When Louis VIII died from dysentery in 1226, she ruled as regent because Louis IX was just 12 years old.

This late Gothic style is more able to capture this feeling, while retaining the features of delicate elongation from Early Gothic. Notice the Crown of Thorns, wiry body and crumpled.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Creating an Emotional Response<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The goal of late Gothic sculpture was to create an emotional response in the viewer. Churchgoers were confronted with agony, death, and sorrow. This was different from the jubilant images of Christ that they normally saw in early Gothic art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Andachtsbild<\/strong> (end-ACHT-speeld) is the German word for <strong>devotional image<\/strong>. It puts human pain in perspective and reminds us of Christ\u2019s sacrifice and Mary\u2019s great suffering. Religious figures are therefore humanized.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look at R\u00f6ttgen Piet\u00e0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Virgin cradles Christ after he has been removed from the cross. Christ is emaciated, through living an ascetic life of deprivation to achieve greater spirituality. He is drained of blood and stiff in rigor mortis.<\/p>\n<p>The horror of the Crucifixion is evident. <strong>Stigmata <\/strong>is visible on his hands and feet. The Crown of Thorns has caused his face to bleed. Mary\u2019s face is twisted in anger, confusion, \u00a0and anguish, as tears roll down her face.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A New Christ<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The is an early, medieval representations of Christ that is focused on his divinity. Prior to this Christ was depicted on the cross but did not suffer. Eventually, by the late middle ages or late Gothic era, this new focus on a suffering Christ emerged.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art Reflecting Life<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Suffering was part of the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century. It was a difficult time with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hundred Years War<\/li>\n<li>Plague<\/li>\n<li>Famine<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Artwork suddenly took on a tragic tone.\u00a0 Fearful churchgoers sought comfort and reassurance in the idea that Christ and Mary understood their suffering and the woes of humankind. Scenes of the Pieta and Mary\u2019s suffering became very common.<\/p>\n<p>This led to a period of worship called <strong>Marian Devotion<\/strong>. Mary was seen as an accessible, warm, motherly intercessor who could advocate for humankind through Christ.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Gothic Goes International<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Late Gothic Era was so popular across Europe that it is known as International Gothic.

Then it must dry before the paint is applied.\u00a0 This means the paint does not absorb into the wet plaster but sits on top instead.<\/p>\n<p>Leonardo was experimenting with <strong>fresco secco<\/strong> or dry fresco,\u00a0 because <strong>traditional buon fresco<\/strong> requires an artist to work at an accelerated pace. Once dry, the paint changes colour and anything remixed will not match. Also, Leonardo was given to much contemplation while working and it was a slow process for him.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Last Supper in Disrepair<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Leonardo used <strong>oil and tempura mixed<\/strong>. The oil provided the subtle tones that were his trademark. Tempera was needed to accomplish the fresco. The two did not mix well!<\/p>\n<p>The stones that the paint was applied too were porous. This wall was adjacent to the kitchen in the monastery which became humid.<\/p>\n<p>Everything combined caused disrepair.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Timeline: <\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Last Supper was completed on February 9<sup>th<\/sup>, 1498<\/li>\n<li>By the end of 16<sup>th<\/sup> century, a writer says the work is already \u201call but ruined\u201d<\/li>\n<li>1652: door cut out of fresco<\/li>\n<li>1768: curtain hung over it to protect it, but it kept moisture in<\/li>\n<li>1796: the space was used as armory then prison<\/li>\n<li>1820: sections removed to be fixed, glued back on<\/li>\n<li>WWII: building is bombed, every wall falls but this one<\/li>\n<li>Today, only 42.5% of the work is original Leonardo<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>The Work\u2019s Perspective<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em>The Last Supper<\/em> is based on <strong>one-point perspective<\/strong>, where <strong>orthogonals<\/strong> bring the viewer back to Christ in the center. He is the <strong>vanishing point<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Compositionally Speaking<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Leonardo uses the <strong>numbers three and four<\/strong> to define the composition. The number <strong>three symbolizes the trinity<\/strong>. The number four symbolized Plato\u2019s <strong>four virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation, justice<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>There are four groups of three disciples that form 12 all together. There are three windows in the back. There are four wall panels on both sides.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Other Painterly Techniques<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Leonardo use <strong>chiaroscuro<\/strong> to show the roundness and 3D of figures. He also uses his technique of <strong>sfumato<\/strong> or smoke. It is a subtle way of airbrushing without creating harsh lines and adds a hazy effect.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Lack of Halos<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The figures do not have halos. These have been fully abandoned. Renaissance artists preferred the shape of the triangle, as it is the most balanced and stable.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of the <em>Last Supper<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was made for the <strong>refectory<\/strong>, the room where the Dominican friars, eat silently. Last Supper scenes were common scenes for refectories and appropriate for the location. Monks could contemplate the scene as they ate.<\/p>\n<p>This was part of a plan to renovate this church by Ludovica Sforza, Duke of Milan. Lunettes above are painted with the Sforza court of arms to show patronage.\u00a0 This conveyed the wealth, status, and piety of Ludovica Sforza and meant to be his <strong>good work.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Leonardo Da Vinci was the Sforza court painter and that is how he was given the work.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Observations<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is the moment, at the Last Supper (Passover Seder) when Christ says, as in Mark 14:18, \u201cOne of you will betray me.\u201d His closest followers react according to their personalities with an incredible range of emotions.<\/p>\n<p>Christ also says to apostles, \u201ctake, eat; this is my body\u201d. This is the founding moment of the Eucharist, the most important Catholic moment in the service, when the bread and wine turn into Christ\u2019s body and blood.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The identify of each disciple from left to right:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>First Trio:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bartholomew<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>James<\/strong>, son of Alphaeus<\/li>\n<li><strong>Andrew<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Second Trio and the most important apostles:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Judas <\/strong>has a bag of silver in his right hand. This is payment for betraying Christ to Romans.\u00a0 He is cast in shadow to show his character. Bad manners betray him, with elbows on the table and knocking over salt. There was an expression at the time \u201cto betray salt\u201d, which meant to betray your master because masters were known to pay workers in salt, an expensive spice.<\/p>\n<p>Judas backs away from Christ. He turns his neck to reveal it, symbolizing he will hang himself and he is caught. Leonardo painted him intentionally darker, so that through contrast, we will know who he is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Peter<\/strong> holds a knife in his right hand, foreshadowing that he will sever the ear of a soldier, as he attempts to protect Christ from arrest. At the Last Supper, Christ foretold that Peter would deny him three times before the morning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>John the Evangelist<\/strong>, swoons and closes his eyes. He looks very young and does not know how to process what he has been told. He might faint.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jesus <\/strong>is the most important figure. He is in the center showing <strong>pride of place<\/strong>. The window behind him acts as a halo. He is triangular in pose, calm and stable.\u00a0 He reaches towards a glass of wine, with his left hand and bread with the right. The message is that only through Christ can you reach the perfect and heavenly landscape in the back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Third Trio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Thomas<\/strong> holds up a finger, foreshadows when he will doubt Christ\u2019s wounds and feel them. Meanwhile, <strong>James the Greater<\/strong> has his arms in air. Part of this trio includes <strong>Philip<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fourth Trio<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Matthew<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Jude Thaddeus<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Simon the Zealot<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Leonardo has presented the viewer with the \u00a0principals of humanism, rationalism, and idealism.<\/p>\n<p>All disciples, including Judas, and Jesus sit on same side of table.<\/p>\n<p>To humanize this work, none of the figures are given halos. This was popular during the Renaissance. Also, all unnecessary details are eliminated.\u00a0 The walls, table and room decoration are simple.<\/p>\n<p>All figures show emotion. Leonardo was unusual in that he chose to depict the moment right <em>after<\/em> Christ says, \u201cOne of you will betray me.\u201d \u00a0Typically, artists showed a generic Last Supper scene.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Leonardo Da Vinci <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artist <strong>Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519)<\/strong> left his mark on not only art but science. Born in the Tuscan hamlet near Vinci, he apprenticed for nine years, with Florentine Andrea del Verrachio, a sculptor, painter, and goldsmith.<\/p>\n<p>Meeting people in and around the studio, Leonardo would also develop skills in mechanics, carpentry, metallurgy, architecture, drafting and chemistry. A prolific sketcher, he kept is drawings and ideas in notebooks.<\/p>\n<p>Later, after setting up his own studio, he focused on religious art, plus portrait commissions. Eventually, he became the court painter to the Duke of Milan.<\/p>\n<p>When the French invaded Milan, Leonardo returned to Florence. Here he accepted the commission in 1503, to paint his masterpiece, <em>Mona Lisa<\/em>, a painting of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 77<em>. <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece <\/em><\/strong><em>(closed)<\/em><strong><em>. <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald.

This is essentially a box of statues covered by folding wings <strong>multi-media<\/strong>, with <strong>three layers<\/strong>. Notice the stylized bodies, and dramatic colours.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Hospital of St. Anthony<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The hospital was built by the Brothers of St. Anthony in a monastery at Isenheim.\u00a0 St. Anthony was the patron saint of those suffering from skin diseases. This hospital specialized in ergotism also known as St. Anthony\u2019s Fire.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Ergotism?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ergotism is caused by eating fungus that grows in rye flour. Symptoms include skin infections, gangrene, convulsions, and hallucinations. This is not surprizing as the hallucinogenic drug LSD comes from the same strain of fungus.<\/p>\n<p>The disease can also attack the central nervous system. If left untreated, it can lead to death.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How this Altarpiece was Used<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece<\/em><\/strong> was used during mass, in the monastic hospital of St. Anthony\u2019s, for patients. It was positioned at the end of the room , so it was visible from bed. Not only does this work mirror the physical and emotional pain of the patients, but it also emphasizes miracles and an end to suffering.<\/p>\n<p>Swinging the altarpiece open would split Christ\u2019s body along his right shoulder. Amputations were common for ergotism sufferers.<\/p>\n<p>The bright colours used on the altar piece could draw attention, even from patients in a hallucinatory state.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Details of the Altarpiece<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The altarpiece was left closed until Sundays.<\/p>\n<p>One the <strong>left wing of the closed work<\/strong>, is St. Sebastian, martyred by being shot with arrows. The pockmarks on his skin associated him with skin diseases.<\/p>\n<p>On the <strong>center panel<\/strong> is the Crucifixion. <strong>Mary <\/strong>is swooning, dressed in the same as the nuns at the monastery hospital.\u00a0 She is caught by the young and beardless <strong>John the Evangelist<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mary Magdalene<\/strong> appears on her knees, with hands clasped. She is pleading and looking up at Christ.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Christ <\/strong>is deliberately painted to look as if he suffers from ergotism. Note the body marked by pox, and \u00a0dead and decomposing flesh. Christ\u2019s hands are writhing in agony. His arms are almost torn from their sockets, and his body has been painfully lashed.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>lamb<\/strong> illustrated is Christ\u2019s embodiment as a sacrificial lamb, carrying its own cross and bleeding into a chalice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>John the Baptist<\/strong> is not commonly depicted at the crucifixion of Christ. Yet here he gestures towards the suffering body and holds a scroll which reads, \u201c<em>He must increase, but I must decrease<\/em>.\u201d Translation: put our ego second because God comes first.<\/p>\n<p>On <strong>the right wing<\/strong> is St. Anthony Abbot, the patron saint of those suffering from skin diseases. (Pork fat was used to help heal skin, so he is often seen with a pig.)<\/p>\n<p>On the \u00a0<strong>predella, <\/strong>or base of the altar is the Lamentation scene, with the tortured body of Christ and those trying to help.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Second Scene<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-547\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-547\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/77-Isenheim-alterpiece-closed-1.jpg?resize=700%2C501&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"501\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isenheim altarpiece, open \u00a9 Scala\/Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Once Sunday rolled around <strong>the altarpiece was opened for a view<\/strong> on the panels inside.

A low horizon line to makes figures appear larger, so they are idealized, noble and strong.<\/p>\n<p>The size of the painting is befitting of history paintings, which were painted in a large manner to imbue the subject with grandeur.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>French Academy Painting Debates<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the French Academy, there were great debates about how to paint, the kind of influence to use, what to prioritize, and what the process should be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Classicists, <\/strong>\u00a0led by an artist named Poussin, argued that a subdued and controlled line should be the basis for compositions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Poussinistes<\/strong> promoted linear rationalism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Naturalists<\/strong> , led by Rubens, argued that the focus should be on intense, dramatic color, as the basis for designs. They were also called <strong>Rubenistes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Commission of Two Dozen Paintings<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>Marie de\u2019 Medici<\/em><\/strong> is one in a series of 24 huge, historically chronological paintings allegorically retelling the life of Marie de\u2019 Medici, Queen of France, and wife of Henry IV. This painting is number six. It shows the marriage negotiations that took place in 1600.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Marie de\u2019 Medici<\/em><\/strong> commissioned these works from Rubens to commemorate the reconciliation with her son Louis XIII. The Queen had just returned to Paris after being exiled.\u00a0 The works were also a celebration of her life\u2019s triumphs.<\/p>\n<p>These works were placed in her mansion, just south of the Louvre, \u00a0called Luxembourg Palace. The works convey the message of peace, prosperity, and God\u2019s blessing. She had it all.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Details of the Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ultimately <strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of Marie de\u2019 Medici<\/em><\/strong> was considered a history painting, though it was also a contemporary one for the time.<\/p>\n<p>Henry IV gazes on her face in a portrait, held up by Hymen, the god of marriage on the right and cupid on the left. Hymen holds a flaming torch, symbolizing the intensity of love. Cupid points to Marie, encouraging Henry.<\/p>\n<p>This was an arranged marriage and the two had not yet met.<\/p>\n<p>Judging by the painting, he is completely smitten with her image. So enamored is he that, he has walked away from the battle in the background. He has even dropped his shield and helmet on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Marie looks out at the viewer from her portrait.<\/p>\n<p>The personification of France, is a woman dressed in royal blue silk, with gold fleur-de-lys, the country\u2019s symbol. On top of her head is a light blue, plumed helmet.\u00a0 She stands behind the king, touching him gently and urging him to marry her. This is what is best for France.<\/p>\n<p>This is a match approved by the gods. Zeus and Hera sit above on a cloud, hands touching, even though these two do not generally get along. Yet, In the presence of love, they reconcile.\u00a0 hey are surrounded by their attributes including eagles, thunderbolts, and peacocks.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Henry Solo\u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Henry IV<\/strong> was a Protestant who converted to Catholicism upon taking the throne in 1593. He was called upon to take this role when a distant cousin and brother-in-law, Henry III died.\u00a0 This coincided with French Wars of Religion between 1562-1598, a war between the French Roman Catholics and the French Hugeonots, or Protestants.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Couple Wed and United <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Henry was 50 and Marie was 27 when <strong>they married by proxy in 1600<\/strong>. The portrait of the woman stood in for the real one on their wedding day. Her hefty Medici dowry was going to help France\u2019s large military debt be paid off. He was outspoken in the fact he did not which to marry her. He was heard muttering, <strong>\u201c<em>By God, if I must marry her then I must<\/em>.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not only did the money help, so did her faith. People accused him of being a fake Catholic, so he took a Catholic wife. Most of France was Catholic, so the king had to be the religion of the majority.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Children Followed<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Marie gave birth to a son one year after the wedding. Five additional children would follow. Daughter Elisabeth married the future King Philip IV of Spain before Mariana of Austria. Her daughter Henriette married Charles I of England.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Regent Rules<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Henry IV was assassinated in 1610 by a fanatical Catholic. At only nine years old, little Louis XIII could not rule yet.\u00a0 <strong>Marie de\u2019 Medici became regent<\/strong>. She was disliked tremendously.<\/p>\n<p>When Louis XIII was old enough to take the throne, advisors convinced him that Marie de\u2019 Medici had abused her power. Fearing she would try to usurp, \u00a0<strong>her son exiled her from Paris<\/strong>, in 1617.<\/p>\n<p><strong>She and Louis XIII reconciled in 1619<\/strong>, in the Treaty of Angouleme. She returned to Luxembourg Palace, in 1620.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Rubens<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Peter Paul Rubens<\/strong>, (1577 was a Baroque Flemish painter with masterpieces that include portraits and landscapes, religious and mythological compositions.<\/p>\n<p>Although Rubens was born in Germany, after his father\u2019s death, in 1587, his mother moved the family to Antwerp, Belgium.\u00a0 Here, he apprenticed as an artist. As soon as he had completed his training, he set out for Italy to study the great Renaissance and classical works.<\/p>\n<p>Returning home eight years later, he was appointed court painter to the rulers of the Netherlands, the Archduke Albert, and his wife Isabella. He soon set up his own study receiving so many commissions that he had to hire a large team to help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When Marie de\u2019 Medici commissioned this painting cycle, Rubens was worried.<\/strong> Much of her life was not positive and was not suitable to put on a canvas. How was he going to fill 24 canvases? Rubens got inventive and elevated mundane moments of her life with mythological and allegorical figures<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 93.

In December 1531, a man named Juan Diego was on his way to mass. He walked on theTepeyac hill, formerly a site of a shrine to an Aztec mother goddess. Here, the Virgin appeared to him as an apparition. She asked Juan Diego to tell the Bishop of Guadalupe to construct a shrine in her honor on the hill.<\/p>\n<p>Juan Diego asked the Bishop. \u00a0He did not believe Juan Diego and requested proof.<\/p>\n<p>Juan Diego returned to the site and saw her a second and third time. Finally, on the fourth meeting she told Juan Diego to take roses growing on the hillside and to the Bishop.<\/p>\n<p>When Juan Diego opened his cloak, \u00a0the roses spilled out in front of the Bishop. The flowers were miraculously imprinted with the image of the Virgin.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately, the Bishop began construction on the hill!<\/p>\n<h5>The Tunic<\/h5>\n<p><strong>Virgin of Guadalupe\u2019s<\/strong> tunic was kept by the church here as a relic. \u00a0Her image was made by an unknown artist.

This is modeled after depictions of the Holy Family showing the Virgin, St. Joseph, and Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The European father wears French-style European clothing complete with a powdered wig. The indigenous mother is dressed in a <strong>huipl<\/strong>, a traditional woman\u2019s garment worn by indigenous women from central Mexico. It has lace sleeves. Her sumptuous jewelry indicates to the viewer that she is an aristocratic native. The two types of dress styles help to carry the subject matter of blended families forward.<\/p>\n<p>The child is a racial mix of both parents. The family appears calm, harmonious, and loving. A young servant holds the child while looking up to the baby\u2019s father.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Sociedad de Castas<\/strong> was the racial hierarchy developed in the New World to alleviate social anxieties over mixed-race people.

He has squandered \u00a0his aristocratic fortunes. Pointing to his family tree, with a medieval knight suggesting a great lineage, he sits with a gout-ridden foot made worse with inactivity. There are Old Master\u2019s paintings on the walls and construction going on outdoors in the new Palladian style.<\/p>\n<p>Here, also sits <strong>a wealthy merchant<\/strong> without a title. <strong>Lord Squanderfield\u2019s son<\/strong> and the <strong>merchant\u2019s daughter<\/strong> are going to marry.<\/p>\n<p>Young Squanderfield is picking snuff out of a box, while looking in the mirror at his own reflection. He has his back turned toward his soon to be bride, with disinterest. Black velvet patches cover syphilis marks.<\/p>\n<p>The daughter sits frumpily and slumped over to show a lack of intelligence, while being wooed by <strong>Silvertongue, her father\u2019s lawyer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting 2 (The Tete a Tete) <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Tete to Tete means \u201chead-to-head\u201d or \u201cface to face\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the marriage, each partner has been pursuing pleasures without the other. The <strong>husband<\/strong> has been out all night with another woman and gambling. The dog sniffs at a bonnet in his jacket, as if assessing what the husband has been up to. The man looks tired and upset. There is a broken sword underneath him indicating a loss.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>wife<\/strong> has been playing cards all night. Her bodice is undone. She is yawning. Slyly she is looking out of the corner of her eye to see if he notices. Her lover has just left in a hurry! Notice the turned over chair. The violin player has made a hasty retreat. Violins were symbols of sexual pleasure, in old medieval reference, alluding to what has just taken place.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>accountant<\/strong> wears a frustrated expression. He throws his hands up in the air. She has lost a fortune at cards. He just cannot get this couple to take their finances seriously.<\/p>\n<p>The chandelier\u2019s candles have just gone out. They have been burning all evening.\u00a0 A sculpture with a broken nose has been knocked over on the fireplace mantle. This indicates that although the couple have nice things, they do not bother to take care of them.<\/p>\n<p>There is a nude painting on the back wall, next to three paintings of saints. The nude is covered with a cloth, but it is still visible. It has been covered in a haphazardly way, just like her affair!<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>servant <\/strong>is yawning in the back room, while rearranging the chairs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting 3 (The Inspection)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Young Squanderfield<\/strong>, suffering from syphilis, makes a visit to a <strong>doctor<\/strong>. Notice the black patches on his neck. Brandishing his cane, he shows the doctor the black mercury pills that do not work.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>sickly girl<\/strong> stands in front of him weeping. They both have the disease. The <strong>tall woman<\/strong> may be her mother or a madame.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor too is riddled with disease.\u00a0 His office is full of curiosities, including a skull. This could be symbolizing that the disease can cause death.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting 4 (The Toilette)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Lord Squanderfield has died. <strong>Young Squandefield is now the Earl,<\/strong> and <strong>his wife is now the Countess.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In keeping with the height of fashion, Countess holds a toilette. <strong>Lawyer Silvertongue<\/strong> lounges, with his shoes off and feet up looking comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>Silvertongue tries to get Countess to attend a masquerade with him because no one will know who they are. Beside him is a book called <em>The Sofa<\/em>, which was a common erotic novel of the day. There is a coral rope used for teething on the chair where the Countess sits. The baby is not in the artwork to illustrate her poor maternal skills.<\/p>\n<p>The Old Masters\u2019 paintings hanging depict Lot and His Daughters (incest), Jupiter and Io (seduction), and Rape of Ganymede (homosexual seduction).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting 5 (The Bagnio)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Squanderfield<\/strong> catches his <strong>wife<\/strong> with her lover, <strong>Silvertongue<\/strong>, in a bagnio, or inn, where rooms could be taken without questions asked. The Earl has burst into the room to find an unmade bed, recently used.<\/p>\n<p>Squanderfield is fatally wounded by Silvertongue, who escapes.\u00a0 A sword is on the floor The Earl is now dying, while Countess pleads for forgiveness.<\/p>\n<p>The noise has awakened the inn. The Judgment of Solomon on the wall foreshadowing the inevitable destruction of all involved.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting 6 (The Lady\u2019s Death)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Countess returns after her husband\u2019s murder only to commit suicide after Silvertongue is hung for murder. The newspapers on the floor tell the viewer of the hanging.<\/p>\n<p>The child\u2019s legs have braces indicating she has rickets. This was understood at the time to be associated with overindulgence. She also has a black patch, indicating her misfortune of contracting syphilis from her parents. This family tree will come to a tragic end.<\/p>\n<p>The merchant removes the rings from his daughter\u2019s fingers before rigor mortis sets in.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Social History of the Period<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Marriages in the past had been arranged for economic benefits. However, with the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century marriages started to be based around love and affection.\u00a0 This collection of works showed the downfall of an arranged marriage.<\/p>\n<p>In the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution, the landed aristocracy was losing power to a new upper-middle merchant class or <strong>bourgeoisie. <\/strong>\u00a0An increasingly large middle class wanted to buy art \u00a0prints.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>English artist <strong>William Hogarth (1697-1764)<\/strong> trained as a silver engraver and print maker before becoming an artist. His work in oils was self taught.<\/p>\n<p>Hogarth was known for tackling controversial topics. Beer Street and Gin Street were two engraving prints that drew focus to society\u2019s alcoholism.<\/p>\n<h5>UP NEXT:<\/h5>\n<p><strong>Early European and Colonial Americas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>200- 1750<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-european-and-colonial-american-3-5\/\">Topic 3.5\u00a0Theories and Interpretations\u00a0 of Early European and Colonial American Art<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early European and Colonial Americas 200- 1750 Topic 3.4 Purpose and Audience \u00a0in Early European and\u00a0 \u00a0Colonial American Art Corporate &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-european-and-colonial-americas-3-4\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Early European and Colonial Americas 3.4<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,9],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/124"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=124"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/124\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2754,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/124\/revisions\/2754"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=124"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=124"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=124"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
