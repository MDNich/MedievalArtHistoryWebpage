Popes are now directly commissioning art. The Church had traditionally turned away from classical antiquity. Now, under Pope Julius II, it is embraced. Religions and secularism are joined.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>About Raphael<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Italian Renaissance painter <strong>Raphael (1483- 1520)<\/strong> was born in Urbino, Italy. His father was a painter for Duke of Urbino, so he was taught skills early. He died when Raphael was just 11 and the boy was forced to take over his father\u2019s workshop. Soon, Raphael was known as the best painter in his town.<\/p>\n<p>In 1500, Raphael was invited to apprentice in Perugia, Central Italy, with master painter Pietro Vannunci. After four years, Raphael left to move to Florence, where he was inspired by the great artists of the time. Raphael would be best known for his work in painting Madonnas and frescos.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 75.

Her massive form is a basic triangle, in that she widens towards the hips. Circular forms create the scroll, knees, and cloak. While the space she sits in is rigid, her body is round.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Enhancing the Female Form<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Female forms were based off the muscularity of men. Her arms are extremely powerful. Even so, she has a grace and gentleness. In the style of the day, ennobling the female forms made the figures appear stronger and greater.<\/p>\n<p>It was considered inappropriate to sketch a female nude at the time. Male nudes were often substituted. In this case Michelangelo used cadavers to achieve the correct musculature.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Delphic Sibyl <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The word\u00a0Sibyl\u00a0was first mentioned by the ancient Greek writer Heraclitus in 500 BC. It was not just Old Testament figures who foretold the coming of Christ. One of the most famous Delphic Sibyls predicted the falling of Troy.<\/p>\n<p>The position of Sibyl was filled by many different women over the years. There were no social or economic criteria for the role, but she had to be wise, in her 40s or 50s, and understand the role of the gods.\u00a0 On the seventh day of every month, she sat at the Delphic temple on a big rock, with ivy growing on it. Here, she would make prophecies.<\/p>\n<p>Her blue head scarf\u00a0 acted as a crown or diadem to show her legitimacy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><em>Creation of Adam<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-714\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/16-th-Century-Southern-Art-Title-Page-1.jpg?resize=990%2C558&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/16-th-Century-Southern-Art-Title-Page-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/16-th-Century-Southern-Art-Title-Page-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/16-th-Century-Southern-Art-Title-Page-1.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/16-th-Century-Southern-Art-Title-Page-1.jpg?w=1282&amp;ssl=1 1282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This narrative has been paired down to essentials.

The Catholic Church was trying to maintain authority, during Protestant rumblings, corruption, and extravagance.<\/p>\n<p>Michelangelo began to work on the frescoes for Pope Julius II in 1508. He asked the artist to paint a ceiling with geometric designs and place the 12 disciples in the spandrels. Michelangelo proposed this instead.<\/p>\n<p>The ceiling of the <strong>Sistine Chapel<\/strong> had become quite filthy, with years of dust and candle soot. It was not until the ceilings were cleaned, in the last 20 years, that the work of Michelangelo was revealed. Full, vibrant colors, for a new generation to marvel at!<\/p>\n<p>Prior to this, historians often spoke about Michelangelo as a poor colorist or that he seemed to have used drab and bland colors.<\/p>\n<p>Almost immediately during cleaning, it became apparent that the ceiling was simply <em>that<\/em> dirty that it had obscured Michelangelo\u2019s brilliant use of vibrant color.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-721 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Paintings-1.jpg?resize=966%2C435&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"966\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Paintings-1.jpg?w=966&amp;ssl=1 966w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Paintings-1.jpg?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Paintings-1.jpg?resize=768%2C346&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-722\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Painting-2.jpg?resize=990%2C550&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Painting-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Painting-2.jpg?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Painting-2.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/75-Clean-Painting-2.jpg?w=1221&amp;ssl=1 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Michelangelo<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Michelangelo (1475-1564)<\/strong> was born in Caprese, Republic of Florence, in Italy.\u00a0 He was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect, and poet and considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>He trained with painter Ghirlandaio, once his father realized his son had zero interest in school and would therefore never take over the family\u2019s financial business. The boy would first learn the techniques of fresco and draftsmanship.<\/p>\n<p>After one year, he moved into the palace of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the Medici clan.

And unlike wood, canvas could stand up to humidity better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oil painting<\/strong> was imported from Northern Europe. It quickly replaced tempera, a quick-drying paint bound by egg yolk that produced a flat, chalky, opaque surface.<\/p>\n<p>This new medium was perfect for painting soft nudes and flesh tones. Also, when oil dries, it is somewhat translucent which allows reflection of light and results in a shiny surface. Titian even <strong>added ground up glass to his pigments<\/strong> to better reflect light.<\/p>\n<p>The use of <strong>chiaroscuro <\/strong>or the effect of contrasting light and shadow, created from light that falls unevenly, is applied here.\u00a0 Subtle changes of skin tone are apparent from her neck down across her chest and in between her breasts. Then it runs down across her torso and abdomen, along her thigh and towards her knee.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve deep tones, Venetian painters would slowly apply <strong>glazes <\/strong>to build up layer upon layer of oil paint on canvas. Since oil dries slowly, the colors could be blended <strong>wet-in-wet<\/strong> (<strong>alla prima<\/strong>). On her body there are up to 15 layers of paint.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-726\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/80-Close-Up-B.png?resize=700%2C429&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/80-Close-Up-B.png?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/80-Close-Up-B.png?resize=1024%2C628&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/80-Close-Up-B.png?resize=768%2C471&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/80-Close-Up-B.png?w=1090&amp;ssl=1 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Proportion Play<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Titian manipulated the portions of the woman\u2019s body to make it especially elegant, soft, and rounded. The viewers eyes are drawn to her face, torso, and hips. Looking closer, her feet are too small for her body.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Complex Spatial Environment<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The figure is placed forward, on a soft diagonal, from the upper left to lower right of her body.\u00a0 The middle shows servants from a back view, along with a chest.<\/p>\n<p>The canvas itself is divided into two, with the dark green curtains. This gives contrast to the woman\u2019s face and torso, so the viewer cannot clearly see the details.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Gift from the Duke<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Titian painted this at the request of Duke Guidobaldo della Rovere of Urbino to his young wife Giulia Varano. It is not clear to the viewer who the subject is. It could be Venus, a courtesan, or the wife. Since this was a private commission, Titian may have painted Giulia. It may have hung over the marital bed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What Does Venus of Urbino Represent?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This painting in an allegory of marriage in three parts. It represents:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eroticism:<\/strong> the woman is naked and represents Venus the goddess of love.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fidelity: <\/strong>the dog represents fidelity<\/p>\n<p><strong>Motherhood: <\/strong>is represented by the two servants in the background, as the younger one is supervised.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Venus in Name Only<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Naked paintings often had the word \u201cVenus\u201d in the title to make painting a naked woman more acceptable. That does not mean it in not a picture of a real woman.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story Unfolds <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>We know that the woman is sexually available, but faithful to her husband. Living in luxury is possible because of her husband\u2019s status.\u00a0 She is confident and possesses a coyness, as she looks right at the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Symbolism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bedsheets:<\/strong> red, sign of love and romance<\/li>\n<li><strong>Roses:<\/strong> are a sign of Venus and marriage and love<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pearls:<\/strong> are a sign of Venus (from the shell she comes from)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dogs:<\/strong> can symbolize fidelity and faithfulness, but also carnality\/sexuality<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cassone:<\/strong> trunk intended for storage of clothing for wife\u2019s dowry<\/li>\n<li><strong>Luxurious home and servants:<\/strong> wealthy family<\/li>\n<li><strong>Myrtle bush:<\/strong> common plant for weddings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Titian and the Reclining Female Nude<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Titian is credited with establishing the genre of the reclining female nude. He learned from his teacher Giorgione.<\/p>\n<p>Most female nudes are recumbent, posed so that the viewer can see them, and asleep. This made for a\u00a0 pleasant and undisturbed viewing experience for men, as the women in these paintings did not know the men were gazing upon them. This provides a sense of anonymity for the men and an enticing sense of voyeurism.<\/p>\n<p>However, Titian changed the final detail. <strong><em>Venus of Urbino<\/em><\/strong> is awake. She is aware of the gaze, but she welcomes it.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Titian<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Titian (1488-1576)<\/strong> was considered one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance.\u00a0 Born Tiziano Vecellio, in what is now Pieve di Cadore, Italy, he was an apprentice to Venetian artist Sebastian Zuccato.<\/p>\n<p>His first major commission was Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, in Venice, in 1516. His work <em>Assumption of the Virgin<\/em>, painted for the church\u2019s high alter, stablished his career.<\/p>\n<p>Next, he created a work, inspired by mythology, <em>The Worship of Venus<\/em>, between 1518-1519, one of several commissioned by Alfonso I d&#8217;Este, duke of Ferrara.\u00a0 Wealthy patrons continued to hire him, including King Philip II of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 78. <em>Entombment of Christ <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Jacopo da Pontormo.

He was a leading painter and one of the most important artists in German art during the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century. He created numerous paintings, woodcuts, altar pieces, court pieces and portraits. Fascinated by the female form, he created innumerable pictures of women, from elongated female nudes, to fashionably dressed ladies, drawing from both the Bible mythology.<\/p>\n<p>The artist never signed his full name to his works. In fact, the early pieces, before 1504 , did not contain his name at all.\u00a0 From 1504 to 1506, he entwined his initials \u201cLC\u201d. Then, up until 1509, he signed works with his initials separated. Leading up to 1914, he added three initial and a winged serpent, which was he coat of arms. In 1515, he dropped his initial altogether and just used the coat of arms. This later method was also used by his son, artists Lucas the Younger.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 74.<em> Adam and Eve. <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Albrecht D\u00fcrer.

This object is a tool, with a flat round top that fits into the palm of the hand. It has a short, sharp tip. The width and depth of the engraved line depends upon the angle the tool is used.<\/p>\n<p>Once the surface is cut it is covered with ink. This pools into the incised area. The ink is then wiped away from the surface. The surface is then applied to paper with pressure.<\/p>\n<p>The work uses <strong>hatching<\/strong> and <strong>cross-hatching<\/strong> to show value.\u00a0 <strong>Hatching<\/strong> is a bunch of <strong>hatches<\/strong> or lines grouped together that are all going in the same direction. <strong>Cross-hatching <\/strong>is when groups of hatches cross over other hatches.<\/p>\n<p>The artist\u2019s monogram is included on the bottom corner of the sign in the work.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influences<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The nude figures were influenced by Italian art. The bodies are frontal and stand in <strong>contrapposto<\/strong>. Based on Vitruvian\u2019s canon of proportions, where the face determines the proportions for the rest of the body. The\u00a0 etching was inspired by two sculptures:\u00a0 <em>Apollo Belvedere<\/em> and <em>Medici Venus<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Adam and Eve <\/em><\/strong>is an early example of the muscular, and contrapposto human form, in the North.
