										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>BAROQUE ART RELIGIOUS REFORM</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Baroque art</strong> is rooted in the controversy launched by the Protestant Reformation that began in Germany in 1517 C.E. The various kingdoms and city-states of Italy, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and France remained devoutly Catholic. Wars fought in the name of religion were wars of political empire as much as spiritual conviction.</p>
<p>Two major developments rooted in the Protestant Reformation shaped the evolution of art in the 17th century.</p>
<h5><strong>Religious:</strong></h5>
<p>Pope Paul III convened the Council of Trent in the hope of resolving conflicts and bringing Protestant sects back into the Catholic fold in 1545 C.E. It met periodically until its conclusion during the reign of Pope Pius IV. The Catholic doctrine and decrees on the communication of theology revitalized the Catholic Church throughout Europe. The schism between the Catholic Church in Rome and the Protestant sects proved permanent.</p>

<h5><strong>Political:</strong></h5>
<p>Decades of strife concluded with treaties that largely tied religious observance to national boundaries and secular government. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 C.E. provided a temporary resolution to conflict in the remains of the Holy Roman Empire, establishing that, in any given territory, rulers could choose either Catholicism or Protestantism, and the religion of the head of state would be the religion observed by the citizens. In certain larger cities, such as Cologne, Strasbourg, and Frankfurt, residents enjoyed religious freedom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2519" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=613%2C738&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="613" height="738" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=850%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 850w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1 249w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=768%2C926&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?resize=1274%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1274w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Repentant-Peter.jpg?w=1369&amp;ssl=1 1369w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Repentant Peter</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wait, aren’t those basically the same?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but remember that there wasn’t really a separation of church and state until much later, and in some places not at all. So, if there was a shift in religion, it impacted the political landscape, and vice versa.</p>
<h5><strong>Baroque—The Religious Side</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Realism was a prominent feature of Baroque art</strong>, built on the rationalism of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Realism was a basic tenet of the program laid out for the arts by the Catholic Counter-Reformation. During the Renaissance, naturalistic form supported theological doctrine through images and sensations that people could recognize and identify with. This naturalism represented supreme rational order, the divine perfections of God&#8217;s universe, and rejected the sensational and arcane effects of the Mannerists.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church argued that art should provide Christians a way to get closer to God, sharing the pains and sorrows of life to achieve salvation through suffering. The decree of the Council of Trent dictated requirements for producing images of veneration</p>
<ul>
<li>Depict true or biblical events, not false or mythical stories.</li>
<li>Be sedate in presentation, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the experience.</li>
<li>Be lifelike, enabling the worshipper to feel present at the event portrayed.</li>
<li>Through emotional and expressive qualities, inspire not just devotion from the worshipper but the desire to emulate the spirituality and sacrifices portrayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decree represented the polar opposite to the Protestant understanding of prayer and communion, and following the saints was perceived by Protestants as idolatry forbidden by the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>The Counter-Reformation evolved into an aggressive propaganda campaign to combat heresy, proclaim the supremacy of the Catholic faith, and incite Protestants to return to the fold.</p>
<p>That won’t work.</p>
<p>The Council of Trent dictated guidelines about images that could be venerated. Compare the guidelines with <strong><em>Madonna dal collo lungo</em></strong>. Did Parmigianino follow the rules?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2520" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Madonna-dal-collo-lungo.jpg?resize=437%2C705&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="437" height="705" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Madonna-dal-collo-lungo.jpg?w=264&amp;ssl=1 264w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Madonna-dal-collo-lungo.jpg?resize=186%2C300&amp;ssl=1 186w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Madonna with the Long Neck. Parmigianino. ca. 1535-1540 C.E. Oil on wood.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depict true or biblical events, not false or mythical stories.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Technicality here. We’re sure Mary sat and held Jesus, but this is not exactly an event, just assumption.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be sedate in presentation, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the experience.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There isn’t really any spiritual nature exemplified here, but an example of the adoration of Mary and Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Be lifelike, enabling the worshipper to feel present at the event portrayed.</strong></p>
<p>Mary’s long neck and Jesus’s long body look distorted and not life like at all, and we won’t even get into the small man in the lower right corner.</p>
<p><strong>Through emotional and expressive qualities, inspire not just devotion from the worshipper but the desire to emulate the spirituality and sacrifices portrayed.</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t an emotional aspect to this painting, the artists intended to inspire worship in the gracefulness and elegance of Mary.</p>
<h5><strong>If It’s Not Baroque, Don’t Fix It</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Baroque art had a high degree of naturalism and dynamic, emotive theatricality.</strong></p>
<p>There were <strong>two principal paths</strong> followed by Baroque artists:</p>
<ol>
<li>naturalistic and anti-Classical style</li>
<li>idealistic and classically inspired</li>
</ol>
<p>The art of <strong>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</strong> was highly anti-Classical style and naturalistic. Trained in Milan, <strong>Caravaggio</strong> was greatly influenced by the realism of Northern Italian painters (who drew from Leonardo) and their early experiments in the genre of still life.</p>
<p><strong>Caravaggio’s</strong> exposure to the religious fervor of the Counter-Reformation incited him to make Christian, specifically Catholic, history and doctrine accessible, understandable, and meaningful to all viewers through his work. His direct presentation, dramatic poses and expressions, and use of <strong>chiaroscuro</strong> made his works appear performed rather than painted with non-idealized, common people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2521" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversion-of-St.-Paul.jpg?resize=547%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="547" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversion-of-St.-Paul.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Conversion-of-St.-Paul.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The Conversion of Saint Paul</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Conversion and religious revelation dominated Counter-Reformation themes, reinforcing notions of the spiritual supremacy of Catholicism.</p>
<p><strong>Caravaggio&#8217;s pronounced chiaroscuro</strong> enhances the religious message of the <strong><em>Calling of Saint Matthew</em></strong>, representing the light of divine revelation. The painting depicts Jesus, in deep shadow on the far right, calling Matthew the tax collector to join his disciples. Set in a commonplace tavern, the nondescript dark background emphasizes the mundane, foul existence Matthew had previously led. The viewpoint is the empty space at the table opposite Matthew, which visually integrates the viewer into the composition as equal witnesses and participants in his conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-994" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/85-Calling-of-Saint-Mathew.jpg?resize=594%2C559&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="594" height="559" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/85-Calling-of-Saint-Mathew.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/85-Calling-of-Saint-Mathew.jpg?resize=300%2C282&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Calling of Saint Matthew</em>. Caravaggio. c. 1597–1601 C.E. Oil on canvas</strong></p>
<p>Jesus himself is barely visible with a thin halo, reaching out to point at Matthew in a manner imitating Michelangelo&#8217;s <strong><em>Creation of Adam</em></strong>. A single beam of light emanates from an unspecified source above Christ&#8217;s head and falls on Matthew, who points at himself in astonishment.</p>
<p>This beam of light makes it obvious that Matthew is being called into the Lord&#8217;s service with expressive clarity, making the painting&#8217;s intention readable to anyone. Just as Adam receives the spark of life from the finger of God, Matthew receives the light of divine inspiration from Christ and begins a new life as an apostle</p>
<h5><strong>Ecstasy, Not Pain</strong></h5>
<p>The same naturalism and theatrical characteristics seen in Caravaggio’s works are found in Gianlorenzo Bernini’s <strong><em>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</em></strong>. Bernini refused to limit the work to a rigidly defined spatial setting; instead, it spills over the boundaries of the niche in the <strong>Cornaro Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria</strong> to integrate the viewer into the saint’s vision.</p>
<p><strong>Bernini combines sculpture, architecture, and painting</strong> to transform the chapel into a stage set complete with theater boxes—typical of the Baroque period. <strong>Bernini&#8217;s subject, the Spanish nun Teresa of Avila</strong>, was selected by its patron, Cardinal Federico Cornaro, to replace a previous statue of the <em>Ecstasy of St. Paul</em>. Characteristic of Baroque’s images of religious inspiration, Bernini depicts a vision Teresa of Avila had: an angel piercing her body with an arrow, bringing her into a painful but ecstatic communion with God.</p>
<p><strong>Bernini</strong> visualizes her experience as a metaphor for Divine Love, with the cherub replacing the fearsome angel of fire, smiling sweetly and adoringly at the swooning saint. Earlier representations of Saint Teresa’s vision depict her kneeling. Here Bernini shows her collapsed backward in an expressive and emotional fashion. Framed by columns beneath a pediment and above the altar, Teresa appears like a vision herself, floating on a bank of clouds that is cleverly supported on a hidden pedestal.</p>

<p><strong>Detail: Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</strong></p>
<p><strong>Like Caravaggio’s conversion painting, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa incorporates light as a metaphor for spiritual revelation</strong>.</p>
<p>The gilded rays beaming down from above reflect natural light from a concealed window above the cornice on the back wall, a clever theatrical effect that Bernini employed frequently. Depending on the time of day, the light diffusing down the rays would bathe the scene in a heavenly, golden glow or set it to blaze with the spiritual fervor that Teresa describes in her account.</p>
<h5><strong>Evolving Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>The design of religious spaces continued to evolve to accommodate the needs of those who ministered and worshiped in them. Explore how religious spaces evolved from Classical influence into the Baroque era.</p>
<p>Buildings, are they really that different?</p>
<p>The different needs of the practitioners and worshipers delegated the functional use of the religious space. In other words, the building’s designs were adapted for each specific purpose. Compare each floorplan—can you see where the centralized focus of worship is?</p>

<p><strong><em>Il Gesù Plan</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Pantheon</strong></h5>
<p>Hadrian succeeded Trajan and constructed monuments all over the Roman empire, including the Pantheon in Rome. The <strong>Pantheon, which literally means “all gods”,</strong> was a temple dedicated to every major deity, and its structure allowed for a large open space, not inhibited by columns, to accommodate large groups.</p>
<p>Seven niches, representative of the seven planets, surrounded the interior housed statues of the seven gods and goddesses, including Venus and Mars.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-258" style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0625rem;" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Outside.jpg?resize=562%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="562" height="450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Outside.jpg?w=406&amp;ssl=1 406w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pantheon-Outside.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><em><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Pantheon</strong></em></p>
<p>The dome overhead was like a heavenly vault with the oculus resembling the sun. It was originally adorned with bronze stars to resemble other heavenly bodies. The vast space of the dome and changing light from the oculus were meant to inspire religious awe and represent a universal religious hierarchy in keeping with cosmic order.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2528" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?resize=427%2C639&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="427" height="639" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?resize=685%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 685w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?resize=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dome.-Pantheon..jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1 696w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Dome. <em>Pantheon</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Pantheon </strong>resembled a typical temple. Originally an inscription on the architrave stated it was built by “Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, who was consul three times.” Hadrian placed Agrippa’s name on the façade as a remembrance of the consul.</p>
<p>The interior is extremely unconventional. A result of Roman engineering, the dome (one of the largest in antiquity) is mounted on a concrete cylinder. The walls of the dome are thicker and heavier near the base and lighter toward the apex, where the oculus punctured the center.</p>
<p>The oculus is open to the sky, and a drainage system channels any rainwater that enters away from the building. The walls were also thinned using <strong>coffers</strong>, which create a rhythmic pattern over the surface of the ceiling.</p>
<p>The base of the dome is accented with alternating rectangular patterns resembling frames and window-like openings. The walls are covered with marble veneer and are heavily ornamented with repeating squares against circles, accenting the niches where statues of the gods stood. The design of the <strong>Pantheon </strong>may have reflected Hadrian&#8217;s personal involvement and interest in architecture.</p>
<h5><strong>Santa Sabina</strong></h5>
<p>Bishop Peter of Illyria constructed the church of <em>Santa Sabina</em> in Rome around 422 C.E. The basic elements of the Early Christian Basilica are discernible on both the interior and exterior. The nave is lit by clerestory windows and flanked by single side aisles ending in a rounded apse. The exterior is simple brickwork, but the interior is covered with marble veneer. The nave arcade is composed of Corinthian capitals reused from a 2nd century building and was once decorated with scenes from the Bible on the wall above and below the clerestory.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2530" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Santa-Sabina.jpg?resize=665%2C430&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="665" height="430" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Santa-Sabina.jpg?w=665&amp;ssl=1 665w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Santa-Sabina.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>Entering the building, the visitor&#8217;s eye is drawn toward the apse of the church. Projecting into the nave is a high pulpit from which the entire congregation could hear the readings of <strong>Gospels</strong>. Unlike later periods in the Church&#8217;s history, Early Christian places of worship do not make a great distinction between the placement of the clergy and the laity. Instead, the architecture of the church is designed for interaction between the two groups</p>

<p><strong><em>Santa Sabina. Rome, Italy. Late Antique Europe. c. 422–432 C.E. Brick and stone, wooden roof.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong><em>Il Gesù</em></strong></h5>
<p>The Jesuits were the pope’s vital partners in the pursuit to reassert the supremacy of the Catholic Church and needed a church to appropriate their distinction as a major participant in the Counter-Reformation. The mother church of the Jesuit order, <strong><em>Il Gesù</em></strong>, was originally commissioned to Michelangelo. When Michelangelo was late in providing the plans, the Jesuits then requested Giacomo Da Vignola to design the ground plan and Giacomo Della Porta to create the façade.</p>

<p><strong><em>Il Gesù’s</em></strong> plan represents a transition: the nave takes on the main volume of space and the structure becomes a great hall with side chapels, while the dome emphasizes the approach to the altar. In comparison with plans of similar churches, like <strong><em>San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane</em></strong>, the opening of the building into a large hall provides a theatrical setting and ritual efficiency and accommodates large crowds, combining social and priestly functions.</p>

<h4><strong>Baroque—The Secular Side</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Thirty Years War</strong> involved nearly all of Europe except for Italy and resulted in the political restructuring of Europe. The redrawing of boundaries created new superpowers in France and the Netherlands and prompted new artistic centers, which allowed for wider dissemination of styles across the continent through increased trade and commerce. Although religious art remained a dominant genre, secular subjects gained in popularity.</p>
<p>Economic competition between countries was relentless. Extensive global exploration, spurred by advances in cartography and shipbuilding and the establishment of major trade routes, gave Europeans access to a wide range of goods, including art.</p>

<p><strong>Still Life with Game Fowl, Vegetables and Fruits</strong></p>
<p>This birthed a commercial art market no longer dominated by the Roman Catholic Church or royal and aristocratic patrons. The mercantile middle class commissioned artworks for their homes and bought pieces ready-made on the open market, evolving artists&#8217; conception and creation of images.</p>
<p>The scientific investigation of the natural world in the Renaissance led to the <strong>Scientific Revolution</strong>—a fundamental transformation of <strong>ideas in physics, astronomy, and biology</strong>. Discoveries by Nicholas Copernicus and Galileo Galilei in the 16th century brought to light the vast scale of the universe and the movement of planets around the sun. Galileo&#8217;s telescope allowed scientists to glimpse the cosmos. Though Copernicus&#8217;s and Galileo&#8217;s ideas were prohibited by the Catholic Church—Galileo was even tried for heresy—they soon spread throughout Europe and even Catholic Italy.</p>
<p>The invention of the microscope turned the lens of scientific inquiry to the smallest elements of the natural world: plants, animals, and microorganisms. This prompted <strong>artists to turn to the natural world for secular subjects</strong>, like still life, landscape, and genre painting—scenes of everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>17th century naturalism was driven by visual and emotional authenticity.</strong></p>
<p>Following scientific interests, which stemmed from Renaissance artists like da Vinci, <strong>psychology, humor, martyrdom, and religious ecstasy were popular themes</strong>. Many <strong>Baroque</strong> works give their subjects a much more <strong>dramatic, immediate, and intimate</strong> presentation than the more coolly rational and balanced images of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Portraiture</strong></h5>
<p>In Northern Europe, both Peter Paul <strong>Rubens and Rembrandt</strong> van Rijn were fascinated by mathematics, natural history, and Classical philosophy and literature. They were sought after as portraitists and cast a lengthy shadow over the subsequent development of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Rubens</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rubens’s</strong> style epitomized the exuberant and sensuous aspects of Baroque painting. Self-taught as a painter, he modeled his style on the Renaissance and antique works of Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto.</p>
<p><strong>Rubens’s </strong>interest in Classical antiquity was annotated in a Latin treatise he wrote, On the Imitation of Statues, “I am convinced that in order to achieve the highest perfection one needs a full understanding of the ancient statues, nay a complete absorption in them.”</p>
<p><strong>Rubens’s</strong> interaction with royalty and aristocracy gave him an understanding of what appealed to the wealthy. One of his royal patrons, Marie de’ Medici, was a member of the famous Italian house and widow of Henry IV. She commissioned Rubens to paint a series of huge canvases remembering and exalting her career. Rubens used mythological and divine representations to elevate Medici and significant moments in her life, giving the impression that it was all divinely appointed.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of Marie de’ Medici</em></strong>, allegorical symbolism is used to conclude that the marriage of Henri IV and Marie de’ Medici was ordained by the gods and a cherished political match. Henri IV is seeing a portrait of his wife for the first time.</p>
<p>He had not met her yet as they were married by proxy. Above is a representation of Zeus and Hera, Greek gods, looking on in approval, as Henri IV seems to be captivated by the painting. The eagle, a symbol for Zeus, and the peacock, a symbol for Hera, confirm this representation.</p>
<p>Behind Henri IV is an allegorical personification of France, which <strong>Rubens</strong> used often in the Marie de’ Medici Cycle to represent French royalty. Cupid holds the painting, while cherubs hold Henri IV’s armor on the ground.</p>

<p><strong><em>Henri IV Receives the Portrait of Marie de’ Medici, from the Marie de’ Medici Cycle</em>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Velázquez</strong></h5>
<p>Diego Rodríguez de Silva y <strong>Velázquez</strong> is the towering figure of the <strong>Spanish Baroque</strong>. Except for two extended trips to Italy, he spent almost his entire professional life at the royal court in Madrid.</p>
<p>When he was a young child, Velázquez’s parents, who were of lesser nobility, instilled in him a religious fervor and an emphasis on the importance of a classical education. He received a traditional training in languages and philosophy before becoming a painter. Velázquez’s teacher and eventual father-in-law, Francisco Pacheco, was a respected painter and an expert in the polychromy of statuary. From him, Velázquez acquired the habit of the direct study of nature. Unlike his teacher, Velázquez did not “improve” upon and idealize nature. Instead, he used direct observation as way to make a more truthful image.</p>
<p><strong><em>Las Meninas</em></strong> is an unprecedented image of family and royalty. In placing himself in the stately company, <strong>Velázquez </strong>also offers visible proof of the nobility of art. The viewer sees the child Maria Teresa attended by her maids, tutors, page, caretaker, and dog in the corner—the people who would normally be accompanying the princess. It was customary in royal courts to include individuals with various physical differences, and people with dwarfism usually served as caretakers and playmates for the royal children.</p>
<p>In the shadows at the left, half-hidden by an immense canvas, the painter pauses with paintbrush in hand. The subject of his work are the king and queen, the perceived viewers of this scene.</p>
<p>The princess and her companions are in the room to accompany her parents, to relieve their boredom. In fact, there is a blurry reflection of their faces in the mirror at the back of the room. Or is <strong>Velázquez </strong>painting the princess instead, even though she has her back turned to him?</p>
<p>Velázquez has turned this public representation of the royal family into a picture of the act of looking and of representing. As a picture of nobility, it is also a self-portrait. <strong><em>Las Meninas</em></strong> signifies a new way of thinking in European art, relinquishing portraiture from Classical representations and formality.</p>

<h5><strong>Rembrandt</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rembrandt</strong> van Rijn, the son of a miller and a baker&#8217;s daughter, received an excellent education, attending Latin school and later the University of Leiden. Unlike most Dutch artists, <strong>Rembrandt </strong>painted a wide variety of subjects—portraits, history, mythology, religious narratives, and landscapes.</p>
<p>A prolific self-portraitist, <strong>Rembrandt</strong> represented himself more than a hundred times in drawings, etchings, and paintings.</p>
<p>Self-portraits of famous artists were a kind of currency as gifts for honored guests or people to whom the artist was indebted. Self-portraits enabled<strong> Rembrandt</strong> to explore the effects of light and color, including <strong>tenebrism</strong>, and to experiment with brushwork.</p>
<p>The series constitutes one of the most revealing and honest autobiographies ever made. He recorded every change of fortune and impact of time and emotion with dispassionate truth.</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait with Saskia</em>. Rembrandt van Rijn. 1636 C.E. Etching.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait with Saskia</em></strong> is a portrait of <strong>Rembrandt and his wife</strong>, one of his favorite models, and is the only etching he made of the two of them together. The couple’s representation wearing historical clothing from the 16th century illustrated their relationship and love, not a lifelike representation.</p>
<h5><strong>Le Brun</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Elisabeth Vigee Le Brun</strong> executed over nine hundred works during her lifetime, including history paintings, landscapes, and idealized likenesses of prominent aristocrats, including Marie Antoinette. <strong>One of the most successful women artists</strong>, she was greatly impacted by Peter Paul Rubens, and she made replicas after his Medici cycle and painted two self-portraits under his influence.</p>
<p>Her <strong><em>Self-Portrait</em></strong> emphasizes her skill in her ability to paint fabrics, her monumental composition with an intriguingly turned away canvas, and the freshness and spontaneity of her confident gaze.</p>

<h5><strong>Portraits—Dutch Style</strong></h5>
<p>In the 17th century, <strong>the Netherlands became immensely wealthy from overseas trade</strong>, prompting an increase in portrait commissions. <strong>Dutch Baroque painting is absent of religious themes and rich with genre, landscape, and still-life secular subjects</strong> that frequently encode moral content. Battle, woodland, moonlight, farm, and village scenes were popular and carried moralistic messages that were felt without being obvious. These paintings met the desire of the middle class for a decorative and accessible art that reflected their secular, commercial, pragmatic lives. They also offered a focus for spiritual contemplation in a Protestant culture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2542" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Woman-Holding-a-Balance.-Johannes-Vermeer..jpg?resize=576%2C652&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="576" height="652" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Woman-Holding-a-Balance.-Johannes-Vermeer..jpg?w=403&amp;ssl=1 403w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Woman-Holding-a-Balance.-Johannes-Vermeer..jpg?resize=265%2C300&amp;ssl=1 265w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance</em>. Johannes Vermeer.</strong></p>
<p>Jan <strong>Vermeer </strong>made his reputation as a painter of interior scenes, a popular subject among middle-class patrons. Women are the primary occupants of the homes he painted, and they present highly idealized depictions of the social values of Dutch citizens.</p>
<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance</em></strong> depicts a young woman wearing a veil and a fur-trimmed jacket standing in a room in her home.</p>
<p>She is illuminated with light from a window, similar to Caravaggio’s use of light in the <strong><em>Calling of Saint Matthew</em></strong> and symbolizing spiritual enlightenment. She stands before a table on which she has spread out her most precious possessions, which reflect the sunlight. She is holding a balance for weighing gold, but it is empty, odd since they are in perfect balance.</p>
<p>Behind her is a painting of the Last Judgment, in which Christ weighs the souls and is representative of the hidden meaning. The woman holds the scales in balance and contemplates the kind of life she must lead to be judged favorably on judgment day.</p>
<h5><strong>Still LIfe Painting</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Still-life painting</strong> is named for the Dutch stilleven, a word coined about 1650 C.E. to describe artful arrangements of flowers, food, and household objects.</p>
<p>Still lifes were often classified by the food and utensils they featured, as exemplified in <strong>Rachel Ruysch’s</strong> <strong><em>Fruit and Insects</em></strong>. <strong>Ruysch</strong> was one of only three Dutch female artists to receive great acclaim during the <strong>Dutch Golden Age</strong> and was referred to as the most celebrated Dutch woman artist of the 17th and 18th centuries. <strong>Ruysch</strong> was successful for nearly 70 years as a specialist in flower paintings and woodland scenes. She was accepted to The Hague&#8217;s Painter&#8217;s Guild in 1701 and several years later was invited to Düsseldorf to work for the duke as a court painter.</p>
<p><strong>Ruysch</strong> came from a distinguished and wealthy background. Her interest in floral subjects probably originated with her father, a famous botanist. As a young woman, she produced numerous still lifes of plants and fruits in a woodland setting. Often these works had a variety of snakes, toads, moths, grasshoppers, and the like, which differentiated her from the many other floral painters of the age.</p>
<p>She connected still life with scientific observation and <strong>vanitas symbolism</strong>. At 15, <strong>Ruysch</strong> was apprenticed to the well-known Dutch flower painter Willem van Aelst. From that point on, she produced various kinds of still lifes, mainly flower pieces and woodland scenes.</p>

<h4><strong>Powerful Architecture, Baroque Style</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Versailles</strong></h5>
<p>Like Nan Madol, the Forbidden City, and Machu Picchu, the <strong>Palace at Versailles</strong> communicates the power and authority of the patron who commissioned it: <strong>Louis XIV</strong>. Not only did the palace exemplify his power, but it was designed to communicate the absolute monarchy. This was accomplished through the massive size and grandeur of the palace and the splendor of the gardens.</p>
<p>Versailles, which had been a comparatively modest retreat, became a small city for the king and his enormous entourage. The palace was only a small part of the larger estate. The gardens closest to the palace were the most intricate, with carefully planned flower beds and trimmed hedges. The gardens grew less elaborate the farther away they were from the palace, probably because they were not visible from the building.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2545" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?resize=975%2C749&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="749" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Palace-at-Versailles..jpg?resize=768%2C590&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Palace of Versailles</strong></p>
<p>Two large intersecting canals were the largest elements in the estate, and sculptural decoration could be found throughout. There were also hundreds of fountains, which were a luxury. Many fountains would be turned on only when the king approached, signifying his central role in the ceremonial life of the estate. The plan was organized around a series of round focal points that had various paths radiating outward, much like a stylized image of the sun, further exemplifying Louis’s self-connection with Apollo. This provided both order and majesty to the overall design of the gardens.</p>
<p>Versailles illustrated the order and control Louis XIV had over France.</p>

<h5><strong>Alhambra</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Alhambra</strong> in Spain was built on a hilltop site of an early Islamic fortress and was the seat of the Nasrids, the last Spanish Muslim dynasty. Christians who conquered the complex during the Conquest of Granada felt the palace represented the embodiment of luxury and chose to preserve its beauty and to commemorate the defeat of Islam.</p>
<p>The complex is almost a half a mile along the crest of a high hill and included government buildings, royal residences, gates, mosques, baths, barracks, stables, workshops, servant’s quarters, and gardens.</p>
<p>The <strong>Court of Lions</strong> was the private retreat of Sultan Muhammad V and is divided into quadrants by cross-axial walkways—a garden form called a chahar bagh. The walkways carry channels that meet at a central marble fountain supported on the backs of twelve stone lions. The Court of Lions is surrounded by an arcade of stucco arches embellished with muqarnas.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hall of the Sisters</strong> was designed as a winter reception hall and music room. The ceiling is designed to provide both excellent acoustics and ornate decoration simulating the heavens.</p>

<h5><strong>Cross-Cultural Fertilization—Baroque Style</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The expeditions from Spain resulted in viceroy territories throughout the Indigenous Americas. This cultural infusion resulted in art and architecture that reflected European influence. Explore different artworks from Spanish viceroyalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>The Virgin of Guadalupe</strong></h5>
<p>As Spain colonized the Indigenous Americas, Catholic missionaries insisted on the termination of the indigenous religions. The indigenous peoples were forced to convert to Catholicism and participate in religious practices, including the veneration of saints.</p>
<p>A representation of the Virgin Mary, the Virgin of Guadalupe is found throughout Mexico today in homes, churches, and other everyday areas. The initial image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is believed to be an acheiropoieta and imprinted on Juan Diego’s robe in a spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Several copies have been made, including the <strong><em>Virgin of Guadalupe (Virgen de Guadalupe)</em></strong> by <strong>Miguel González.</strong></p>
<p><strong>González’s </strong>version is inlaid with fragments of shell and created using a technique called <strong>enconchado</strong>.</p>
<p>In the representation, the Virgin is on top of an eagle perched on a cactus, representing Mexico City’s coat of arms. She is surrounded by four round framed images supported by angels and depicting her appearance to Juan Diego, along with the moment Diego revealed the imprint to the Bishop.</p>
<p>The influx of Asian goods to Mexico during the period of colonization affected the artistic production and inspired decorative arts. This is evident in the elaborate shell-inlaid frame that combines floral motifs with symbols of the Virgin.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-553" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/95-Virgin-of-Guadalupe.jpg?resize=621%2C823&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="621" height="823" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe (Virgen de Guadalupe).</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</strong></h5>
<p>The introduction of a culture in colonization impacts the receiving culture in many ways, including intercultural mating. This was captured in <strong>casta paintings</strong>, which document the process of race mixing among the three main groups that inhabited the Spanish colonies: Indian, Spanish, and African.</p>
<p>These paintings are often labeled and attempt to scientifically document interracial procreation. However, casta paintings depict a separation and hierarchy of races, giving the false impression that the more European you are, the more valuable you are.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-554" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/97-Spaniard-and-Indian-Produce-a-Mestizo.jpg?resize=795%2C621&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="795" height="621" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/97-Spaniard-and-Indian-Produce-a-Mestizo.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/97-Spaniard-and-Indian-Produce-a-Mestizo.jpg?resize=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</em>. Attributed to Juan Rodríguez Juárez. c. 1715 C.E. Oil on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>Evidence suggests that these paintings were commissioned by Spanish viceroys and reflect an apprehension of racial mixing.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</em></strong>, a European father is depicted with his indigenous wife, with a servant carrying their child between them. The wife is wearing a traditional garment, but the father is represented wearing French-style European clothing. While this couple looks happy, as time progressed and more casta paintings were produced, interracial procreation was viewed in a negative light through depictions of conflict and poor living conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene</em></strong> is the only known work to combine a biombo and the enconchado technique. Depicting a scene from the Great Turkish War, the screen was commissioned by Jose Sarmiento de Valladares, viceroy of New Spain, and likely displayed in a ceremonial stateroom in Mexico’s viceregal palace.</p>
<p>The Siege of Belgrade is on one side of the screen, and a hunting scene was on the back; the screen functioned to separate a portion of the room to give the impression of an intimate sitting room. It is evidence of European themes combined with indigenous techniques.</p>

<h5><strong>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</strong> lived in the Spanish viceroyalty of Mexico and was a prodigy, learning to read and write Latin at the age of three. Although she received many marriage proposals, she chose to pursue intellectual interests and become a nun.</p>
<p>Sor Juana Inés de la was an accomplished writer and supporter of women&#8217;s right to education. She is <strong>depicted by Miguel Cabrera</strong>, after her death, in her habit and seated at a desk in a library in <strong><em>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.</em></strong></p>
<p>Her position at the desk is symbolic of her intellectualism, and her escudo de monja and rosary are symbolic of her religious devotion.</p>
<p>The portrayal as an intellectual and religious woman is significant, as often nuns are represented in a passive manner. But Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz looks directly at the viewer while surrounded by symbols of her accomplishments and faith.</p>

<h5><strong>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Master of Calamarca</strong> was a Bolivian artist known for painting angelic representations on the walls of a Catholic church in Calamarca, Bolivia. <strong><em>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei</em></strong> exemplifies several European influences.</p>
<p>The inscription Asiel Timor Dei identifies the angel as Asiel, and timor dei means “the fear of God” in Latin. Asiel is portrayed wearing a European-looking garment with ballooned sleeves and intricate patterns.</p>
<p>He has a feather plume in his hat and wears traditional European stockings and shoes. The textile with intricate patterns, along with the feathered hat, was a sign in the indigenous Andean culture that the wearer was of high social status. Asiel’s clothing is not specific to one culture, but a merging of the two.</p>
<p>Asiel has the <strong>gender-neutral features associated with angelic representations</strong> in the Catholic Church, and the gun is a significant symbol of the Counter-Reformation efforts of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-931" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/90.-Angel-with-Arquebus.jpg?resize=588%2C824&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="588" height="824" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/90.-Angel-with-Arquebus.jpg?w=236&amp;ssl=1 236w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/90.-Angel-with-Arquebus.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei</em>. Master of Calamarca (La Paz School). c. 17th century C.E. Oil on canvas.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The Counter-Reformation was associated with the military, believers and angels were considered the army of God. Guns came to represent the Spaniards and were possibly considered supernatural by the indigenous cultures, as they had not seen them before the Spanish conquests.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The Catholic Church responded to the Protestant Reformation with the Counter-Reformation, which through the Council of Trent provided a list of requirements that artists should meet in producing images of veneration.</p>
<p><strong>Baroque art was naturalistic, theatrical, and used chiaroscuro to enhance the emotional impact of an artwork.</strong> The design of <strong>religious spaces</strong> continued to evolve to accommodate the needs of those who ministered and worshiped in them. <strong>Secular demands for artworks</strong> included portraiture, landscapes, and still lifes. <strong>Architecture displayed power and authority</strong> not only through palaces, but through complexes and gardens. Indigenous art of the Spanish viceroyalties demonstrated European traits in cross-cultural fertilization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>NORTHERN ART and EMOTIONAL IMPACT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Northern European art</strong> is perceived as a regional variation on Italian Renaissance themes. However, a different economy and social structure in the North provided fertile ground for religious change. This change resulted in art that was highly emotional and was created to evoke a response from the viewer.</p>
<p>Matthias Grünewald&#8217;s <strong>Isenheim Altarpiece</strong> was produced for the chapel of a hospital in Isenheim dedicated to <strong>St. Anthony Abbott, the patron saint of sufferers of skin diseases</strong>. The hospital specialized in the care of patients with illnesses including the plague, leprosy, and ergotism. Many believed the painting had the power to heal those who looked upon it.</p>
<p>Depending on the position of the multiple sets of wings, the images express themes of dire illness, miraculous healing, the pain suffered by Christ, and the promise of salvation. The work was displayed in a hospital where skin diseases were treated, and it is believed that the grotesquery of the crucifixion scene is meant to reflect on the patients&#8217; conditions and create empathy within viewers as they imagine themselves as one of the patients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2486" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Isenheim-altarpiece.-Matthias-Grunewald.-c.-1512–1516-C.E.-Oil-on.jpg?resize=969%2C737&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="969" height="737" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Isenheim-altarpiece.-Matthias-Grunewald.-c.-1512–1516-C.E.-Oil-on.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Isenheim-altarpiece.-Matthias-Grunewald.-c.-1512–1516-C.E.-Oil-on.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Isenheim altarpiece. Matthias Grünewald. c. 1512–1516 C.E. Oil on wood.</strong></p>
<p>At the center, the <strong>cruelty and violence of Christ&#8217;s death</strong> are conveyed, his body distorted by its own weight as it hangs from the cross. Wounds from the crown of thorns and the whips with which he was beaten cover his body. His flesh is a sickly green and contrasts with the dark red blood. Above the barren landscape, the sky is black and foreboding, further illustrating the sorrow and despair of Christ&#8217;s death as well as <strong>reflecting the cultural tradition of the grotesque in Germanic art</strong>.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>reminiscent of the Late Gothic devotional images like</strong> <strong><em>Röttgen Pietà</em></strong>, and viewers are to contemplate their own suffering, the suffering of others, and the suffering and agony of Christ’s death.</p>
<p>Nothing in the <strong><em>Isenheim altarpiece</em></strong> conveys the ideal form and rational space central to the art of Grünewald&#8217;s Italian contemporaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is larger than the other figures, exemplifying hierarchical scale.</li>
<li>He lacks proportional ratio—his arms and legs are long and distorted.</li>
<li>A landscape is not present; it is barren and lacks perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andrea Mantegna’s <strong><em>San Zeno Triptych</em></strong> portrayal of the Crucifixion displays Jesus in a less emotional and grotesque light.</p>

<li>Jesus is the same size as the other figures; no hierarchical scale here.</li>
<li>His body lacks many of the deathly features seen in the <strong><em>Isenheim altarpiece.</em></strong></li>
<li>Mantegna uses perspective to demonstrate the depth of the landscape, accenting this with smaller figures in the distance</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Religious Reform</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2471" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Martin-Luther.jpg?resize=561%2C604&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="561" height="604" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Martin Luther. Lucas Cranach the Elder. 1533 C.E.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Martin Luther&#8217;s call for reform of the Roman Catholic Church</strong> in 1517 C.E. led to bitter conflict. Despite constant social unrest, religious convictions remained prominent in art production as <strong>Catholic patrons continued to commission religious subjects</strong> to support Catholic theology. While some artists only created works that demonstrated their personal religious values, <strong>other artists worked for clients who adhered to the opposing faith.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lucas Cranach the Elder</strong> was an artist who was <strong>closely associated with the Protestant Reformation</strong> and with Martin Luther. Cranach used prints on paper to promote Lutheran ideology, and the woodcut <strong>Allegory of Law and Grace</strong> gives visual expression to the doctrinal <strong>differences between Protestantism and Catholicism<em>.</em></strong> The two beliefs are separated by a tree and displayed on each side of the work.</p>

<h5><strong>Left Side</strong></h5>
<p>Catholicism is represented by a symbolic representation of judgment day.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus is returning with angels and saints</strong> at the top and raises his left hand in a gesture of damnation. <strong>To the left</strong> is a representation of Adam and Eve at the Tree of Life with a serpent, symbolic of the original sin. <strong>Below,</strong> a skeleton drives off a terrified sinner to a pit of flames and suffering people, representing hell. Moses stands to the side, holding the Ten Commandments, symbols of Old Testament law. This is significant as Luther claimed Catholicism was based on Old Testament law, and that individuals futilely strive to live a good and honorable life in order to attain salvation.</p>
<h5>Right Side</h5>
<p>Symbolic imagery emphasizes the importance of God’s grace as the source of redemption, the emphasis of Protestantism.</p>
<p>To the upper-left, there is an Old Testament scene of the Israelites and the bronze snake, a symbol of Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross. To the right, Jesus is being crucified, and God showers the sinner with streams of blood taking the form of a dove, symbolic of grace. Below, Jesus is seen leaving the tomb in the lower right corner, a symbol of the promise of salvation to all who believe in him. He is walking over a deceased beast, symbolic of Satan and Jesus’s triumph over him in the Second Coming.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Religious Works—Not So Much</strong></h5>
<p>New centers of art production emerged, and the growing wealth of merchants and <strong>the emergence of a true middle class created a source of patronage different from the nobility and the church</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Herman, Paul and Jean de Limbourg, February, from Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, 1413-16, ink on vellum (Musée Condé, Chantilly)</strong></p>
<p>This new market <strong>favored portraits, still life, genre paintings, and landscapes</strong>. These subjects conveyed many of the same moral and spiritual values of earlier religious paintings but avoided the dangers of idolatry condemned by Protestants as inherent in Catholic worship.</p>
<p><strong>Pieter Bruegel the Elder</strong> was the patriarch of a renowned clan of painters. Two of his sons made their own marks in painting, other sons worked primarily as copyists, and his grandsons continued the family business.</p>
<p>Bruegel&#8217;s early works exhibited the influence of an older artist, Hieronymus Bosch. Engraved prints in the style of Bosch were in demand for their creative illustration of religious principles, and Bruegel provided designs for such works early in his career.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em></strong> is believed to belong to a group of paintings describing the months of the year. It is part of a monumental version of the seasonal moments shown in the <em>Très Riches Heures</em> by the Limbourg brothers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-943" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hunters.png?resize=845%2C472&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="845" height="472" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hunters.png?w=543&amp;ssl=1 543w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Hunters.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Most scholars see the series as six images, each devoted to two months. There are five known panels from the series, all identical in dimensions. It is unknown whether Bruegel painted <strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em></strong> for a patron or for his own purposes. Scholars believe it to be a representation of the ideal country life (either what it was, or what it should be).</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The ideal life in the 16th century, is what we would consider ideal country life.</p>
<p>Bruegel&#8217;s somber colors are rich and evoke nature&#8217;s infinite variety. Bruegel includes mountains, valleys, trees, and even waterways (although they are frozen).</p>
<p>Although the landscape is cold and dormant, vegetation is still visible from beneath the snow, connecting to the cyclical nature of the calendar and inspiring hope that spring will come.</p>
<p>His composition moves the viewer&#8217;s eye, which alights first on the hunters in the foreground left. Like text on the page of a book, the image unfolds from left to right. The viewpoint is above the hill that overlooks the town, placing the observer on level with the crows that circle through the air and a bird’s eye view.</p>
<p>The details of the panorama become clear in sequence: the eaves of snow-covered roofs, the solitary pedestrian on the bridge, skaters, and finally jagged stone peaks in the distance. All is one in this cold, quiet world.</p>
<p><strong>Humans are in harmony with the seasons as a pure spiritual balance.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Italian Renaissance</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> painted the <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong> for the refectory of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. The realistic and proportional portrayal of Jesus and the Disciples in narrative form and the use of perspective are evidence of Renaissance ideas.</p>

<p><strong><em>Last Supper</em>. Leonardo da Vinci. ca. 1494–1497 C.E. Fresco</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leonardo uses emotion to narrate the story</strong> of the Disciples’ reaction to Jesus’s news, including fear, doubt, protestation, rage, and love. Jesus is further humanized by the elimination of the halo that was common in Byzantine, medieval, and early Renaissance art. Light from the window behind Jesus’s head creates the suggestion of a halo. The absence of light to shade Judas’s face suggests deception. This <strong>contrasting of light and dark is known as chiaroscuro</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Andrea del Castagno</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Andrea del Castagno</strong>, da Vinci’s Florentine contemporary, <strong>painted a fresco of the <em>Last Supper</em></strong> in the church of Sant’Apollonia.</p>
<p>His portrayal features Judas on the opposite side of the table. Perspective is used to designate the length of the room; there is an obvious depth portrayed in the three-dimensional nature of the walls, and the placement of the table and figures on the end in front of the other figures enhance this depth.</p>
<p>The figures are detailed and naturalistic. The composition is balanced, with 5 Disciples on each side of Jesus and John, who is sleeping. Halos are present, in contrast to Leonardo’s <em>Last Supper</em>, but are presented in perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Last Supper. Andrea del Castagno. Florence, Italy. 1445–1450 C.E. Fresco.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Tintoretto</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Tintoretto</strong>, a Venetian Renaissance painter, used extreme perspective and chiaroscuro in his portrayal of the <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong>. The figures are joined by angels and employ dramatic movements in narration. The table is viewed from above and to the left, instead of straight on, as in da Vinci’s <strong><em>Last Supper</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Foreshortening is seen as the figures in the foreground are larger than those in the back, and servants take up the front center of the work, emphasizing the different perspective. Jesus has a radiating halo around his head, reverting to Byzantine depictions, while the Disciples have a mild glow.</p>

<h5><strong>Michelangelo</strong></h5>
<p>In style and personality, <strong>Leonardo</strong> and <strong>Michelangelo</strong> were at odds. While Leonardo was fascinated by all aspects of the natural world, <strong>Michelangelo</strong> scorned landscapes, perceiving the human body as the basis of narrative and composition.</p>
<p>As an integral part of Pope Julius II’s campaign to reassert the primacy of the papacy, he moved the papal seat to the Vatican, Constantine’s ancient complex, where St. Peter, the apostle and first pope, was buried. <strong>Pope Julius had Michelangelo repaint the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in 1508 C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The chapel was built by, and named for, Pope Sixtus IV, who was also Julius’s uncle. In “completing” a space created by a member of his family, Julius invoked the idea of dynasty, a notion reiterated by much of his patronage as pope. The <strong>Sistine Chapel</strong> was a semiprivate space for the pope to pray and celebrate Mass, and it was also where the conclave of the cardinals met to elect new popes.</p>
<p>Though its walls had already been decorated in the 15th century with frescoes by Botticelli.</p>

<p><strong> The Flood</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Flood</em></strong> narrates the biblical account of Noah and the Flood. Far in the background, the ark is floating on calm seas, but as the figures draw closer, the seas become more tumultuous, and several figures are shown attempting to escape death in the water by climbing to higher lands or boats.</p>
<p>The landscapes are extremely bare, evidence of <strong>Michelangelo’s </strong>disdain for painting landscapes. The tree to the left is bare, and there is no detail in the green land to the left. It appears as rocky outcrops. The figures are portrayed in a classical style, emphasizing musculature and mostly nude, but overlapping with each other in the scene.</p>
<h5><strong>Antiquity, it’s back.</strong></h5>
<p>The figural representations of the <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl</em></strong> and the Virgin Mary have similar idealistic and realistic portrayals, just like in the propagandistic representations of Caesar and Augustus.</p>
<p><strong>Michelangelo’s Delphic Sibyl</strong> is a portrayal of a female seer from antiquity, one of a group who were rumored to have predicted the coming of Christ. Prophets and Sibyls are portrayed sitting on thrones, alternating male and female figures around the perimeter, all of whom prophesied the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>It is notable that the <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl</em></strong> is a representation of the voice of Apollo, a Greek god. This Gentile representation symbolized that Jesus’s birth was not only for the Jewish people, but for all people in the world. The <strong>colors of her clothing, yellow, blue, white, and orange</strong>, are <strong>symbolic of</strong> the basic elements of life: <strong>earth, water, air, and fire</strong>.</p>
<p>Classical and Christian traditions are joined, as was common in High Renaissance works, but no perspective or emotional lighting is used. Michelangelo&#8217;s interest in the human body coincides here with humanist rhetoric and sermons given in the Sistine Chapel at the time, which exhorted both God and the created universe as worthy objects of praise.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Delphic Sibyl and the Flood</strong> are stark contrasts to Leonardo’s <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em>, in which there is a rich landscape and rocks. The figures are presented in a pyramidal grouping. Chiaroscuro reveals the figures, while the background is dark and mysterious. Leonardo employs atmospheric perspective to give the illusion of depth. The peacefulness of the scene in <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em> is very similar to the peacefulness portrayed in <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl</em></strong>, while it is in stark contrast to the chaos that occurs in the Flood.</p>

<h5><strong>Raphael</strong></h5>
<p>While Michelangelo was perched on the scaffolding in the Sistine Chapel, <strong>Raphael</strong> was painting the stanze in Pope Julius II&#8217;s private apartments. The Stanza della Segnatura, Room of the Signature, where the pope signed official documents, functioned as Julius&#8217;s private library, separate from the official Vatican Library. Appropriately for the library of a patron of intellectuals, <strong>Raphael covered each of its walls with an allegory of one of the four branches of knowledge: theology, poetry, law, and philosophy.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>School of Athens</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Plato and Aristotle</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2501" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Plato-and-Aristotle.png?resize=461%2C698&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="461" height="698" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Plato-and-Aristotle.png?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Plato-and-Aristotle.png?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>On either side of the vanishing point are <strong>Plato and Aristotle</strong>. Metaphysician Plato gestures up toward the “ideal” world of the heavens and holds his text Timaeus, which addresses the relationship between heavenly and earthly bodies. Aristotle, whose moral philosophy derived from the observation of the material world, gestures down to the earth and holds his volume, Ethics, and had a great impact in shaping the early church.</p>
<h5><strong>Ancient Authors</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2502" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ancient-Authors.png?resize=922%2C515&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="922" height="515" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ancient-Authors.png?w=614&amp;ssl=1 614w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ancient-Authors.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Many of these ancient authors are portraits of Renaissance artists</strong>. It was common for artists as distant as the Gothic period to use contemporary faces to represent religious or ancient personages. Here the melding of artist and philosopher shows two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It illustrates the shift in Renaissance thought, elevating art to an intellectual pursuit.</li>
<li>It insinuates a triumph of the humanist desire to recapture the golden age of antiquity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Heraclitus</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2503" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heraclitus.png?resize=537%2C634&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="537" height="634" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heraclitus.png?w=366&amp;ssl=1 366w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Heraclitus.png?resize=254%2C300&amp;ssl=1 254w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Heraclitus, </strong>the melancholic figure leaning on a marble block, was not part of the original design. He bears the trademark broken nose and buckskin boots of Raphael’s rival, Michelangelo. When the scaffolding in the Sistine Chapel was temporarily taken down in 1510 C.E. and Raphael saw Michelangelo’s frescoes, he added his portrait to the School of Athens in Michelangelo’s own monumental style.</p>
<p>Raphael was known for his ability to imitate the styles of other artists, and this witty out-Michelangelo-ing of Michelangelo has been equally interpreted by scholars as an attempt at flattery and as a painterly thumb to the nose.</p>
<h5><strong>Mannerism—Not as Polite as You Thought</strong></h5>
<p>The works of <strong>High Renaissance artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci</strong> served as a point of departure for the next generation of artists, the Mannerists, or Mannerism. <strong>Mannerists rebelled against the current cultural concept and idealistic classical portrayal and opted to present works as stylized, or mannered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mannerist works are stylized to appear exaggerated or distorted</strong> in comparison to the balanced works of the Renaissance. Such stylizations are interpreted as refined or developed formal elements undertaken for the sake of beauty or refinement itself. They have been related to the sophistication of European courts or seen as a reflection of the religious and social tensions and controversies of the period. Mannerists rebelled against the current cultural concept and distorted classical portrayal.</p>
<h5><strong>Entombment of Christ</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Florentine artist Jacopo da Pontormo was one of the first Mannerists</strong>, whose work <strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong> encapsulated spatial and anatomical distortions to create a weirdly visionary depiction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong> works as part of a larger ensemble of images in the Capponi Chapel in the Church of Santa Felicita in Florence and is a depiction of Christ&#8217;s burial. Christ is the limp form to the left, carried by his grief-stricken followers to his tomb. Women comfort the Virgin Mary, in blue, who watches her son helplessly, her right arm reaching for him.</p>
<p><strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong> uses the characteristic <strong>Mannerist color palette of wild blue and pink</strong>, which stand in contrast to both the Renaissance color palatte of reds, golds, browns, and greens and the tortured expressions of the participants in the narrative.</p>
<p>The scene is a departure from previous depictions of the Entombment. The faces appear not only sorrowful at the events taking place but also psychologically unbalanced. Olive-green shadows create the eerie lighting of the scene.</p>
<p>The spatial setting and structure of the image are unclear, with some figures appearing to float. Mary&#8217;s garments envelop her like a cloud of fabric. The two bearers of Christ strike poses that are ungainly, highlighting both the strangeness of the scene and the painter&#8217;s facility in the handling of anatomy.</p>
<p>The overall composition of the work circulates around the center of the canvas instead of a clear, rational focal point.</p>
<p>The painting goes beyond the requirements of the Entombment narrative to include the painter&#8217;s own distinctive vision. The expression-filled faces, the garish coloring, the contorted figures, the disproportionate anatomy, and the lack of symmetry are all marks of Mannerist art. As compared to Italian Renaissance art, there is a lack of perspective and realism. Mannerists rejected Classicism&#8217;s perfect proportions as soulless, choosing instead to warp reality in search of emotional depth.</p>

<p><strong>Mannerism i</strong>s a distinct departure from previous styles. Think of the <strong>naturalism of figures</strong>, the <strong>colors used</strong> and if the work <strong>intended to convey emotion or inspire devotion.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Venetian—More Than Blinds</strong></h5>
<p>Florence developed a rivalry with Venice, and contemporary artists used two terms to distinguish their competing, respective styles: <strong>disegno and colorito</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Disegno</strong></h5>
<p>The principle of <strong>disegno refers to the Central Italian tendency to emphasize composition</strong>. The Florentines prided themselves on rational design, spatial construction, and on the “intellectual” nature of their art.</p>
<h5><strong>Colorito</strong></h5>
<p>Colorito refers to the Venetian penchant for <strong>subtle distinctions of color and light</strong>. Venetian paintings were often characterized as works of subtle poetic beauty, appealing to the eye and the senses.</p>
<p>The Venetian painter Tiziano Vecellio, commonly referred to as <strong>Titian, produced lyrical and poetic secular works, which he described as poesie or favole, poems or fables</strong>, often for patrons outside Venice. Titian preferred subjects of beautiful women and love in the mythological contexts that interested him.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-518" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?resize=876%2C614&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="876" height="614" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Venus of Urbino</em>. Titian. c. 1538 C.E. Oil on canvas.</strong></p>
<p>Titian&#8217;s <strong><em>Venus of Urbino</em></strong> is set in a palace, emphasizing the subject&#8217;s wealth and decorum. Though the typical Venetian sky can be glimpsed through the background window, the painting is situated in the intimate indoor setting of the bedroom. <strong>Titian </strong>was innovative to place a Classical nude in this setting. This is a modern Italian setting, and Titian synthesized Classical and contemporary subjects, which had never been done before.</p>
<p>The woman gazes timidly at the viewer. Roses, traditionally symbols of true love and unabashed sexuality, drop softly from the bouquet in her right hand. <strong>Titian</strong> draws on the Knidos Aphrodite from Greek sculpture, but his Venus is devoid of the attributes the Classical goddess, such as humility; instead, she is unashamedly erotic.</p>
<h5><strong>Speculation</strong></h5>
<p>Speculation over whom Venus represents is dominant. <strong>Titian</strong> sometimes employed <strong>courtesans </strong>as models. The <strong>pair of marriage chests in the background and the dog</strong> at the end of the bed<strong>, symbolizing faithfulness, emphasize the position of the woman as a wife.</strong> However, the dog is asleep, possibly signifying infidelity. As the goddess of fertility as well as love, Venus was often painted in reclining images on the inner lids of marriage chests.</p>
<p>Though the painting was first owned by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, <strong>duke of Urbino</strong>, it is unknown if he commissioned the work or if it was originally intended to be connected to a wedding. Though it is not clear that the woman is supposed to be a portrait of the goddess Venus, brides as far back as antiquity had been linked to the goddess in terms of their shared traits of beauty, sexuality, and fertility. This enables the woman to be a Venus, though she may not be a depiction of the goddess.</p>
<h5><strong>Now, Back to Colorito and Disegno…</strong></h5>
<p>Venetian art was characterized by <strong>colorito</strong>, which had <strong>feminine connotations in contrast to the hard, analytical, and masculine style exemplified by the disegno.</strong></p>
<p>It was appropriate to paint the beauty of a woman in a soft, feminine style, linked to pleasure, emotion, and sensuality. This sums up the quality of Titian’s work as a dual seduction of the viewer through both subject matter and style. This became the model of the reclining nude for later works like <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque </em></strong>and<strong><em> Olympia.</em></strong></p>

<h5><strong>Mexica Redux</strong></h5>
<p>Cultural changes extended beyond Europe during the Renaissance. European exploration and conquests had significant impact on indigenous cultures of the Americas and the Pacific. This resulted in cross-cultural fertilization—European impact on indigenous art, and indigenous impact on European art</p>

<p><strong>Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza. Viceroyalty of New Spain. c. 1541–1542 C.E. Ink and color on paper</strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Codex Mendoza</em> </strong>was commissioned by the first Spanish viceroy of New Spain and narrated the history and customs of the Mexica Empire for Charles V of Spain in the 16th century C.E. Mexica scribes created the schematic representation of Tenochtitlán, but it was later stolen by French pirates who presented it to Francis I.</p>
<p>According to legend, Tenochtitlán’s location was chosen by the sun god Huitzilopochtli, who told the Mexica their wanderings would be over when they saw the mystical sign of an eagle resting on a prickly cactus and eating a snake. In the center of the Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza, you can see the foundation myth of the city—an eagle, a cactus, and a snake.</p>
<p>As in some European maps of the time, which were centered on Jerusalem, the top of the image is east, not north. The small house at the top likely represents the Templo Mayor at the center of Tenochtitlán, as it was considered the center of the universe by the Mexica.</p>
<p>In the triangle to the right, there is a skull rack representing sacrificial victims whose bodies the priests threw down the temple’s steps after cutting out their hearts. Rulers sit with their name-glyphs floating behind them, representing the city’s legendary founders.</p>
<p>The border contains the hieroglyphs for 51 years in the Mexica calendar system. In the lower margin are two Mexica conquests, complete with captives. The depiction of captives as illustrative of power and success had been part of Mesoamerican iconography since the Olmecs. Stylistically, the Mexica inherited many elements from previous Mesoamerican cultures and were intent on continued learning from their past, which is indicated by their extensive archaeological excavations at the nearby ruins of Teotihuacán.</p>
<h5><strong>Turkey- Mimar Sinan</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mimar Sinan</strong>, who converted from Orthodox Christianity to Islam, designed a mosque with the goal of surpassing the greatest achievements of Byzantine architects. He was challenged by <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> and set out to build a mosque higher and grander than <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>. Four slender, pencil-shaped minarets set off the massive dome of the <strong><em>Mosque of Selim II,</em></strong> which surpasses the height of the dome of <strong><em>Hagia Sophia.</em></strong></p>

<p>Sinan designed a unique organization of the interior space. He recessed the mihrab into a deep, semicircular recess that permitted windows to light the space from three sides. This allowed the colored tiled panels on the lower walls to reflect the light. Sinan also designed the dome over an octagon-shaped area, formed by eight massive dome supports and four half-dome corners. This allows for a unified interior space, enhancing the function for large gatherings of worshipers.</p>
<p>Pope Julius II had similar goals in his renovations of <strong>St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican complex</strong>.</p>
<p>Rome once again became the center of spiritual and worldly power in the Catholic world, and the Vatican complex became the symbol of that power. Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderno, with assistance from Michelangelo, to complete the church and provide it with a longer nave and ornate façade. The larger interior would accommodate more pilgrims. The mammoth façade, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini almost 100 years later, and colonnaded square were intended to awe visitors with the power and magnificence of the Catholic Church.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Northern European art</strong> was highly emotional and created to evoke a response from the viewer. Religious convictions remained an important feature of art production of Catholic and Protestant patrons, but demand for secular artwork emerged with a new market for portraits, still lifes, genre paintings, and landscapes. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael created art and architecture that continued in Renaissance ideals. Their works influenced Mannerism, and Venetian artworks competed in style. Exploration and conquests had cross-cultural influence in art and architecture from the Indigenous Americans, the Pacific, and Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ART AND INFLUENCE OF RELIGION</h2>
<h4><strong>ICONS OF FAITH</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Petra Redux</strong></h5>
<p>The city of <strong>Petra</strong> was the capital of the <strong>Nabataean Kingdom</strong> until 106 C.E., when Arabia was annexed by Emperor Trajan and absorbed into the Roman Empire. Petra flourished under Roman rule and continued to be the capital of the region. Petra is a unique city that consists of pink hue rock-cut architecture, and its many caves and façades are sculpted from the soft rock on the sides of cliffs.</p>
<p>A commercial city, Petra had experienced a large influx of cultural influence through trade routes and influence from Egyptian, Roman, and Ancient Near Eastern cultures. The<strong><em> Treasury</em></strong> and <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong>, like the <strong><em>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut</em></strong>, are carved in situ in the side of a cliff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-373" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Petra-Tresaury.jpg?resize=624%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="750" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>reek and Roman influence are reflected in relief sculpture and Roman Corinthian-inspired columns used in the façade of the <strong><em>Treasury</em></strong> at Petra. While the façade of the <strong><em>Treasury</em></strong> is inspired by and uses Roman and Classical Greek conventions, the architect intentionally deviates by altering the width of the columns and using the conventions as ornamentation only. The <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong> at Petra has relief images of mythical animals similar to those used in the Babylonian and Persian empires.</p>

<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Great Temple</em></strong> at Petra is a sacred precinct on the southern citadel hill, likely in an effort of the Nabateans to imitate Greek and Roman city centers. The temple is dedicated to the principal deity of Petra, Dushara, who is unique to Petra and paralleled with Zeus after Greek and Roman influence.</p>
<p>As worshipers enter the complex, they are surrounded by triple colonnades on the east and west side planned similarly to the Generic Greek (Peripteral) Temple Plan. Inside the colonnades is a <strong>lower temenos</strong>, which leads to the <strong>forecourt </strong>and the <strong>pronaos.</strong></p>
<p>Petra&#8217;s plan deviates from the traditional Generic Greek (Peripteral) Temple Plan.</p>
<p>Instead of a cells, there is a small theater or bouleuterion. This leads to the possibility that the temple functioned as a large palace and assembly hall.</p>

<h5><strong>Enter Christianity</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The middle of the 3rd century C.E. was an age of great social, economic, and military disarray in the Roman Empire. The reign of each emperor was usually brief. Rome once again regained a semblance of order under the leadership of Diocletian, who was declared emperor in 284 C.E. Diocletian wisely decided to share power with his potential rivals by establishing a <strong>tetrarchy</strong>.</p>
<p>Constantine, one of the junior tetrarchs, disrupted the tetrarchic system by invading Italy and defeating rival tetrarch Maxentius at the battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 C.E. This allowed him to take control of the Western half of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Constantine enacted many military, financial, administrative, and social reforms that strengthened the Western half, including the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E. This edict supported Christians in the Roman Empire, so that they no longer faced persecution. In fact, the emperor and some members of the Roman elite became the Christian church&#8217;s chief supporters and patrons. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to claim conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p>There were already Christians in the 1st century C.E., but art with Christian themes did not emerge until about 190 C.E. and was created during a period of intermittent persecution. This art reflects both the beliefs of the growing Christian communities and their adaptation of existing Roman artistic styles.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Biblical Knowledge</strong></h5>
<p>Art history is a pictorial document of cultural and religious events. It happened, it was illustrated, so now it can be studied to figure out what people used to do, where they came from, and most importantly, why.</p>
<p>To understand many Early Christian works of art, you need some <strong>Biblical knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Christians adopted the Hebrew Bible</strong> as the <strong>Old Testament</strong>, adding a <strong>New Testament</strong> that told of the life of Jesus, the earliest days of the Christian church, and the ultimate triumph of God in the final book of the Bible, Revelation.</p>
<p>Although <strong>Jesus and the earliest disciples were Jewish</strong>, most of his subsequent <strong>followers were gentiles</strong>. They included narratives from both the Hebrew Bible and their own Greco-Roman culture in the earliest Christian art, as various traditions intersect.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2693" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Book-of-Gospels.jpg?resize=603%2C806&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="603" height="806" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Book-of-Gospels.jpg?w=603&amp;ssl=1 603w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Book-of-Gospels.jpg?resize=224%2C300&amp;ssl=1 224w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5><strong>Art, Death, and Catacombs</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Etruscans used elaborate tombs and mausoleums within larger necropoleis to bury their dead, Jews and Christians used catacombs.</strong></p>
<p>The earliest Christian imagery in the Roman catacombs dates from about 200 C.E. The catacombs in Rome were cut out of a soft rock called tufa, and the walls were lined with loculi where bodies might be placed. <strong>Locul</strong>i line the walls in the gallery of the <strong><em>Catacomb of Priscilla</em></strong> in Rome.</p>
<p>The catacombs are believed to be named after the wife of a Roman consul. She converted to Christianity and as a result was sentenced to death. Originally, the loculi would have been covered with plaques inscribed with information about those buried and sometimes with simple drawings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2694" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Catacombs-of-Priscilla..jpg?resize=784%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="784" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Catacombs-of-Priscilla..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Catacombs-of-Priscilla..jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Catacombs of Priscilla.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Wealthy</strong></h5>
<p>Wealthier families usually had an entire chamber for their burial space, with marble s<strong>arcophagi</strong> to hold the bodies. Complex narratives were designed for the sarcophagi of wealthy patrons. <strong><em>The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</em></strong> combines the Judeo-Christian narrative with the deceased&#8217;s identity as a member of the Roman senatorial class. The style of the sarcophagus represents a new classicizing trend in the 4th century that departs from the harsh tetrarchic style of the late 3rd century. The front of the sarcophagus is composed of two registers, each subdivided by columns into sections that depict various scenes from the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<h5><strong>Religious Narratives</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Religious narratives </strong>in the catacombs portray more than text could. Common motifs represent significant moments or testaments of the faith of the deceased’s life.</p>
<h5><strong>Good Shepherd</strong></h5>
<p>In many cases, Christians and Jews adopted and adapted imagery from the surrounding Roman culture for their own purposes. The motif of the good shepherd was adapted by Christians from images of shepherds popular in the surrounding Roman culture.</p>
<p>In the catacombs of Christians and in churches, this shepherd image was appropriated to represent Jesus, the &#8220;Good Shepherd&#8221; who gave his life for his sheep.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Orant Figure</strong></h5>
<p>Early Christian artists appropriated the orant figure, who raises hands in prayer, from the Roman culture to represent Christian devotees. The female <strong>orant figure</strong> is positioned between two other representations of her life.</p>
<p>In her marriage to the left and with a child to the right. This centralization of the orant figure emphasizes her conversion as a significant life event, like her marriage and the birth of her children.</p>

<h5><strong>Devine Deliverance</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, painters created simple narrative images drawn from the Christian Old and New Testaments to decorate the catacombs and other settings. Dominant were references to the miracles of Jesus or scenes in which faithful figures experienced <strong>divine deliverance</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, the story of Shadrack, Meshack, and Abednego, found in Daniel 3 of the Old Testament, was popular in this period. They would not bow down before the idol of the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar and were thrown into a fiery furnace as punishment but saved from destruction by God.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2700" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=772%2C544&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="772" height="544" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?w=772&amp;ssl=1 772w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Three-Youths-in-the-furnace-of-Nebuchadnezzar..jpg?resize=768%2C541&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Three Youths in the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In this catacomb painting, <strong>the three youths raise their arms in an orant gesture.</strong> Certainly, the theme of avoiding idolatry resonated in a culture full of such idols.</p>
<p>During the 3rd century, Christians found themselves in a position whereby refusing to participate in the imperial cult risked death. This led to the portrayal of deliverance from death. The prayers for the dead often referenced God&#8217;s deliverance of the three Hebrew youths and other figures as a paradigm for the ultimate deliverance of those who were buried in the catacombs.</p>
<h5><strong>Religious Storytelling</strong></h5>
<p>Despite Jesus’s earliest followers being Jewish, Christians interpret events in the Hebrew Bible to have their fullest meaning in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and in the subsequent history of the Christian church. Therefore, events drawn from the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament, are often contextualized and interpreted in Christian contexts as types, or patterns, that foreshadow events in the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>This <strong>typological means</strong> <strong>narratives would be depicted in Jewish and Christian contexts with very different meanings.</strong></p>
<p>The story of the prophet Jonah is shown in Early Christian art in the ceiling decoration of the <strong><em>Catacomb of Petrus and Marcellinus.</em></strong></p>
<p>The ceiling painting, divided by red bands against a white ground, is reminiscent of domestic painting in Rome during this period. The disc in the center is a medallion, and the semicircular areas on the wall below are lunettes.</p>
<p>The<strong><em> Good Shepherd</em></strong> symbolizes Jesus, with the motif of the lambs repeated in the lunettes below. We see three of the four phases from the narrative of Jonah surrounding. Jonah is shown thrown overboard, swallowed by a whale, spit up by the whale after three days in its belly, and finally reclining under a gourd tree.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2701" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Good-Shepard-and-Jonah-Narrative.jpg?resize=805%2C547&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="805" height="547" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Good-Shepard-and-Jonah-Narrative.jpg?w=459&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Good-Shepard-and-Jonah-Narrative.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Good Shepard and Jonah Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Notice that Jonah emerges from the whale spreading his hands in prayer for deliverance in a way that echoes the surrounding orant figures and representations of Jesus as he departs the tomb.</p>
<p>Jesus compared himself to Jonah because he was in the tomb for three days, just as Jonah had been in the whale three days.</p>
<p>A similar mosaic from the <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> is of Justinian I, a Byzantinian emperor, and his attendants. Identifiers of his imperial power are in his clothing. He wears purple with a golden tableion, a richly jeweled crown, and a pendant broach.</p>
<p>Justinian holds the bowl containing the unleavened bread that was used in the Holy Communion and has a halo around his head. Though this is an <strong>important combination of religion and government</strong>, emperors of Constantinople were not considered gods or deified upon their deaths, which was considered idolatry in Christianity, as were emperors in Ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Justinian was not a high priest, as Roman consuls were. The high priest in Constantinople was the archbishop.</p>
<p>Justinian is portrayed as the largest figure, representative of his importance.</p>

<h5><strong>Constantinople Was Byzantium</strong></h5>
<p>The modern-day city of Istanbul, Turkey, was once referred to as Byzantium. It later became consecrated as <strong>Constantinople</strong> in May of 330 C.E. and was named <strong>after the Roman emperor Constantine,</strong> who made it the capitol of the Eastern Empire. Like Rome, it was governed by Roman law, had seven hills, and provided free entertainment and bread to its citizens.</p>
<p>The capital of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire was different from its Western sister-city; everyone spoke Greek, and their holy books and educational systems were in Greek.</p>
<p><strong>Constantinople was a Christian society</strong>. Muslims and Jews existed within its framework, but the emperor, as well as the church&#8217;s patriarch and most of its citizens, were Christian in their faith.</p>

<h5><strong>Byzantine Art </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>art and architecture of Byzantium was dominated by Christianity</strong> and is classified: <strong>early, middle, and late.</strong></p>
<p>There are three major influences in Byzantine art:</p>
<p><strong>Christian:</strong> A concern for spiritual imagery, as opposed to naturalistic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Antique:</strong> Byzantines were proud of their Classical heritage and often looked back to Classical Greece and Rome.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmopolitan:</strong> Constantinople stood on a crossroads between the Christian West and the Islamic East. Persia had great influence on Byzantine art.</p>

<h5><strong>Early Architecture: Hagia Sophia</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, or Church of Holy Wisdom, was the largest church in Christendom for a millennium. It was commissioned by Justinian I between 532 and 537 C.E.</p>
<p>It was built by two architects, Anthemios of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus. They were mathematicians who had never created anything of this scale before.</p>
<p>Completed, Hagia Sophia combines the longitudinal plan of a basilica with the vertical orientation that would eventually characterize most Byzantine churches.</p>

<p><strong>Plan for <em>Hagia Sophia.</em></strong></p>
<p>The use of <strong>numerical arrangements reflected Christian ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 for the Trinity</li>
<li>5 for the wounds of Christ</li>
<li>12 for the Twelve Apostles.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the east and west ends are half-circles, culminating in semi-domes (with five windows), each of which has three smaller semi-domes (with five windows), culminating in three apses. The north and south ends have five arches along the side aisles and seven arches in the galleries above, with 12 windows in the lunettes. The windows themselves are in two rows: one of seven, and one of five.</p>
<p>Early Byzantine churches, like <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, are simple on the outside. However, inside <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, the viewer is transported by the church&#8217;s majesty. Marbles of every color—some shipped from as far as Egypt—form the pillars, walls, and floors. Halls echo with the sound of choirs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hagia Sophia </em></strong>looks very different today than it did in the past. It retains its massive dome, but large buttresses and four minarets were added when the church was <strong>converted to a mosque by the Ottoman Turks</strong> with the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 C.E.</p>
<p>During the day, the 40 windows at the dome&#8217;s base make it look as though it is floating on light. At night, the light of thousands of candles gives the same impression to viewers looking at the dome from the outside.</p>
<p>The builders could incorporate so many windows into the dome because they used <strong>pendentives </strong>to shift the weight from the dome to piers, instead of walls. Because the walls do not support the dome, they could be pierced by many windows.</p>
<p>The use of light provides <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> with an otherworldly, spiritual characteristic of Byzantine art.</p>

<h5><strong>Early Architecture: San Vitale</strong></h5>
<p>The church of <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> was dedicated in the port town of Ravenna a decade after <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong> was built in 547 C.E. This is not a Western-style church, despite being in Italy, because Justinian&#8217;s armies had recently reconquered the region.</p>
<p>Like the plan of <strong>Hagia Sophia</strong>, <strong><em>San Vitale</em></strong> shows two concentric octagons, with the inner one rising above the outer one. In the central space, eight columned arches separate eight piers. The ambulatory and gallery above it are interrupted by a cross-vaulted <strong>chancel</strong> that precedes the apse.</p>
<p>With all this symmetry, the asymmetrical <strong>narthex</strong> is unexpected and gives the church its signature look.</p>
<p>The <strong>sanctuary</strong> is covered with images and symbols that express the idea of Christ&#8217;s redemption of humanity and the reenactment the Lord&#8217;s Supper.</p>
<p>The celebration of Mass occurred on the lower level, and those in attendance witnessed the Mass processional from the upper balconies. This pulled the viewers into the action of the Mass.</p>

<h5><strong>Mosaics: something old, something new</strong></h5>
<p>Byzantine mosaics have features that are both a continuation of and a break with the ancient Mediterranean world. Mosaics take some characteristics, and they leave some behind. The frame around the mosaic is ancient. Intricate clothing is contemporary.</p>

<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>
<p>Frames neatly compartmentalize mosaics with bursts of ornamentation.</p>
<p><strong>Faces</strong></p>
<p>A person depicted in a Byzantine mosaic usually faces front, with staring eyes. While his or her face can be expressive, the features themselves are usually stylized.</p>
<p><strong>Clothes</strong></p>
<p>Much of the complexity of Byzantine mosaics comes from the clothing. Stark, contrasting colors enhance the brilliancy of the drapery.</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>
<p>Byzantine bodies are elongated and generalized, their small, pointed feet dangling as if they float above the ground. They are usually outlined in black, enhancing their stark otherworldliness.</p>
<p><strong>Setting</strong></p>
<p>Mosaic backgrounds are simple, often just a gold field of color.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>
<p>In some Byzantine art, important people are larger and taller than less important people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Still Early Byzantine Art</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Ornamentation</strong></h5>
<p>For Byzantines, the more expensive the materials, the better the works of art. There was a decrease in large marble statuary and an increase in costly <strong>materials like metal, ivory, and glass</strong> in the early period. The glass industry was driven in part by demand for mosaic pieces, enamel for plating, and individual pieces for imperial court made of blue and purple glass.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of what is left of the famous Byzantine glass industry is shards. There was a decline of three-dimensional art (like sculpture in the round) in favor of two-dimensional art (like mosaics, frescoes, and enamels).</p>

<h5><strong>Representation</strong></h5>
<p>Though life-like portraiture was not popular, much of Byzantine art sought to represent people (and angels) individually. Byzantine artists did this by referring to complex Christian and Classical symbolism along with using straightforward Greek labels.</p>
<p>Byzantine images seek to tell a story, either a well-known one from the Bible, an exploit of an emperor or empress, or the heroic actions of a saint.</p>

<h4><strong>Narration</strong></h4>
<p>The word Byzantine today is synonymous with ornamentation. Byzantines employed many elaborate styles of decoration—an elaborate gold frame around an icon, busy geometric patterns on clothing, or thousands of angels crowding an upper register.</p>
<p>Greek letters are decorative and informative, and repeating motifs of flowers and animals are similar to neighboring Islamic art.</p>

<p><em><strong>Barberini Ivory.</strong></em></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Barberini Ivory</em></strong> was once part of an imperial <strong>diptych</strong> celebrating the military triumph of an emperor and represents an intersection of Classical imagery and Byzantine art. <strong>At the center is the emperor</strong> (possibly Justinian) on a horse. Note that he is larger than everything else and carved in higher relief.</p>
<p>In the same panel, Classical elements include a winged representation of Victory flying beside him and a personification of the fertile Earth beneath him. <strong>To his side and behind him</strong> is a barely visible conquered enemy, likely Muslim. More conquered people bearing gifts make up the <strong>lower register</strong>. In the <strong>left </strong>panel, a general holds a statue of Victory. Above the emperor are winged angels surrounding an image of Christ, who gives sanction to the emperor&#8217;s actions.</p>
<h5><strong>Archangel Michael</strong></h5>

<p><em><strong>Archangel Michael.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em>The<strong> <em>Archangel Michael</em> </strong>comes from an ivory <strong>diptych</strong> of the 6th century C.E. A representation of the Archangel Michael, it uses Classical elements including the <strong>wet drapery technique</strong>, Michael&#8217;s facial expression, and the orb of power he bears in his hand. The orb is surmounted by a Christian cross signifying Christ&#8217;s dominion over Earth. There is a change in perspective: Michael is in front of the pillars from the waist up, but his feet are on the steps behind the pillars.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shroud of Charlemagne </strong>is a silken cloth manufactured in Constantinople in 814 C.E. It depicts a large man riding a chariot. Smaller figures are nearby, not touching him. Note the frontal, linear nature of all the figures and the many ornamental circles with their stylized, repeating motifs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Apse Mosaic</strong></h5>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2719" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="722" height="1024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Aspe-Mosaic.jpg?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p>All the figures in the <strong><em>Apse Mosaic and Choir of San Vitale</em></strong> are flat, symbolic, and isolated, lacking three-dimensional representation. There is no overlapping of figures, nor are there natural poses. While Classical, naturalistic poses will make a comeback from time to time in Byzantium, the Byzantine linear form is firmly established, with its focus on spirituality and detail<strong>.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Icons and Iconoclasm</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Byzantine art</strong> is characterized by <strong>icons and highly stylized conventions</strong>. The icon <strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George</em></strong> from the Monastery of St. Catherine portrays Mary, the mother of God <strong>(Theotokos),</strong> enthroned with an infant Christ, flanked by two saints, with angels rising in the background.</p>
<p>An icon like this would be displayed at a church or in smaller form at a private home. All figures are flat and frontal, wearing textured drapery and floating atop small, pointed feet and demonstrate the distinctly Byzantine style.</p>
<p><strong>Early or late, what’s the difference?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, <strong>Early Byzantine</strong> is marked by the <strong>three F&#8217;s—flat, frontal, and floating</strong>. As the period progressed, so did the portrayal of perspective and dimension. If someone is floating, you know what period they belong in.</p>
<p>People soon started spreading rumors about the mystical properties of these spiritual, otherworldly icons. Some icons spoke, cried, or bled. Some were said to be <strong>acheropoietes</strong>.</p>
<p>The Virgin of Vladimir is a middle-period Byzantine icon. She is characteristic of the Byzantine style, evident in the flat gold background, stylized but expressive face, elongated proportions, and ornamentally folded drapery.</p>
<p>Some members of the clergy condemned what they saw as a violation of the second commandment, which bans the use of idols. This influenced Emperor Leo III, who was having a difficult time as Islamic armies kept defeating him. After a major volcanic eruption in 726 C.E. darkened the skies over Constantinople for days, Leo III decided that the hand of God had been withdrawn from his city because icons were being used as idols.</p>
<p>Once Leo III banned icon use, he started to win battles. This began a tradition of <strong>iconoclast</strong> emperors. During this movement, known as <strong>iconoclasm</strong>, church mosaics were painted over with lime and replaced by secular or natural images. Eventually, the widowed Empress Theodora stopped iconoclasm while acting as regent for her son, Michael III, in 843 C.E.</p>

<p><strong><em>Theotokos between Saints Theodore and George</em>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Triumph of Orthodoxy</em></strong> was made in the late Byzantine Period as part of a commemorative celebration of the end of iconoclasm.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Theotokos</strong> is enthroned in the center of the upper register. <strong>Empress Theodora and her young son</strong> take up the left. <strong>On the right</strong> is Patriarch Methodios, a man who had been tortured and imprisoned due to his love of icons and who had been raised to his post by Theodora herself.</p>
<p>In the <strong>lower register</strong> are saints, some holding icons. The background is the now typical gold. The figures are largely frontal, though there is overlapping. A few floating feet are visible. Contrasting colors are the most obvious part of this picture. The overall impression is of an intensely stylized icon-painting tradition.</p>
<p>Icons, of all Byzantine work, are usually the most rigid in form. This is partly due to the popularity of set images among the people and to the standards set by defiant defenders of icons.</p>

<p>The middle period of Byzantine art (834–1204 C.E.) begins at the end of iconoclasm. A new dynasty of Macedonian kings led by Basil I patronized the renaissance of Classical forms. This period is characterized by a renewed interest in Classical references and design. However, this initial resurgence of naturalistic art was then followed by increasing emphasis on elongated forms.</p>
<p>One of the first things the Macedonian emperors did was repair churches mutilated by iconoclasm. In 867 C.E., a new apse mosaic was added to <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>. It depicts a seated Mary Theotokos who doesn&#8217;t seem to be hovering entirely by herself. Her seat shows an attempt at three-dimensionality. Her body is more realistic; you can see her legs through the folds of her clothing. Her attitude toward her child is tender, and her hands are clearly rendered and emotive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Theotokos and Child from the apse mosaic</em></strong>. <strong><em>Hagia Sophia</em></strong>, <strong>Istanbul (Constantinople). 867 C.E. Mosaic.</strong></p>
<p>Perspective and emotion characterized the Middle Period. Faces are generalized, Christ&#8217;s clothing is flat, and the contrasting palette and flat gold background are stark.</p>
<p><strong>Triptychs overcame diptychs in popularity</strong> during the Middle Period. The <strong><em>Harbaville Triptych</em></strong>, made of ivory, displays Christ with Mary and St. John in the upper register of the central panel, with apostles below. Saints decorate the doors.</p>
<p>Note the frontal figures and the elongated feet, raised up on blocks. The figures on the lower registers are all wearing Classical togas, but the drapery is very flat. A decorative plant motif separates the registers in the central panel.</p>
<p>This work begins the decline of classical features and moves toward a new stylistic portrayal: bodies become more elongated and manneristic, and designs become more intricate and ornate.</p>

<h5><strong>More Ivory</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> was carved for al-Mughira, the youngest son of an Umayyad caliph, as a gift for his eighteenth birthday. A <strong>pyxis</strong> is a cylindrical container, usually used to contain perfume or cosmetics, that was traditionally given to members of royal families to commemorate special occasions and featured symbols of royal power and privilege, like hunting scenes and musical entertainments. The <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> is has figural representation and is therefore <strong>not aniconic</strong>.</p>
<p>Art historians think that the symbolism represented in the pyxis illustrates the struggle between the Umayyads the Abasids, another Muslim group vying for power, and that it also served as an invitation to al-Mughira to gather power in hopes that he would be caliph. Therefore, <strong><em>Pyxis of al-Mughira</em></strong> functioned as a container, a gift of luxury, and as a political work designed to serve as royal propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>Inscription</strong></p>
<p>The inscription at the base of the lid of the pyxis says &#8220;God&#8217;s blessing, favors, and happiness to a-Mughira, son of the commander of the faithful, may God have mercy upon him in the year 357 [968 C.E.].&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ivory</strong></p>
<p>The use of <strong>ivory</strong> is significant as it has been considered a luxury item since ancient times. Ivory objects have been found from prehistory, ancient Egypt, China, Japan, and India. While there are no surviving examples from ancient Greece, writings indicate they existed.</p>
<p><strong>Medallions</strong></p>
<p>The pyxis has four medallions, each with 8 lobes, that contain Umayyad symbolism, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scene of the attack of two bulls by two lions, which is a symbol of Umayyad victory.</li>
<li>Two men on horseback retrieving eggs from falcon nests, which symbolize the Umayyads as they were known as &#8220;the falcons of the Quraysh&#8221; and may be a symbol of the Umayyads claim to the throne.</li>
<li>A lute player between two figures, one holding a staff and a bottle, which are symbols of a ruler, the other holding a fan, thought to be a representative of the Abassids.</li>
<li>Figures riding on horseback and collecting dates from trees symbolizing the Umayyads conquering lands under Abbasid control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Decoration</strong></p>
<p>The medallions are surrounded by figures and animals that include falconers, wrestlers, griffons, peacocks, birds, goats, and animals to be hunted. The decoration is intricate and covers the entire visible surface of the pyxis.</p>

<h5><strong>A Time Without Art</strong></h5>
<p>The Middle and Late periods of <strong>Byzantine art</strong> are separated by a gulf of artless space from 1204 to 1261 C.E. This is when Constantinople was sacked by an army of the Fourth Crusade. The Latin invaders built nothing. They put up a puppet state, melting Byzantine metalwork and shipping off much of the city&#8217;s wealth.</p>
<p>When Michael VIII led the restoration of the city, poorer materials were used. Frescoes were more common than mosaics. Paper replaced parchment, and bookmaking diminished. Gold was replaced by silver gilt, pewter, and ceramic—even in the imperial court. Tradition and imitation of older work dominated. Extremities got even smaller and less detailed. Drapery was flat and angular.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Crusaders in Constantinople</em></strong>.</h5>
<p>By the 1400s, Constantinople was in ruins. Centuries of warfare had finally seen an end to the golden city.</p>
<p>Following an invasion by the Ottoman Turks, Constantinople was destroyed and renamed Istanbul in 1453 C.E. Its people were scattered. Some brought the learning of the Greeks back to the West, while some went north, where Russia stood to inherit the traditions of the Orthodox church.</p>
<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>Petra, a commercial city that had architectural and artistic styles that resulted from numerous external cultural influences, became a part of the Roman Empire in 106 C.E. Constantine became the emperor of Western part of the Roman Empire and issued the Edict of Milan in 313 C.E., which ceased the persecution Christians were facing at the time. Art with Christian themes began to emerge in 190 C.E. Pagans, Jews, and Christians used catacombs that were often painted or had mosaics with religious narrative. The city of Byzantium became Constantinople and was a Christian society. Its art reflected Christian imagery and narrative, Classical heritage and cultural influence from Persia and other cultures.</p>

<h4><strong>Medieval Art and Influence of Religion</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>The Big Three</strong></h4>
<p>There are commonalities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. All three are <strong>monotheistic religions</strong> that have much basis in the Hebrew Bible. The spread of <strong>these religions impacted medieval art</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medieval art</strong> is driven by the requirements of <strong>worship, elite or court culture, and learning</strong>.</p>
<p>You have already learned about Islam and Christianity. Let’s explore <strong>how Judaism is interconnected with the Roman Empire and art of the medieval period.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Judaism</strong></h5>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2414" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=975%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="975" height="650" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Medieval-Judaism-Pic.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Judaism believes in one just and fair god</strong> who is concerned with the actions of humankind. it is extrapolated from the Tanakh, or Hebrew bible, which was developed over a millennium and consists of the <strong>Torah, Nevi’im, and Ketuvim</strong>. The Hebrew bible prophesies that a messiah, promised deliverer of the Jewish nation, will come, and bring an age of universal peace and recognition of God. Judaism holds that this event has not yet happened.</p>
<h5><strong>Christianity</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Christianity is rooted in Judaism</strong>, but the two religions deviated from each other in the 1st century C.E. Christians incorporated the Hebrew bible as their Old Testament and have the same beliefs in the nature of God. They believe that prophesies of the Old Testament were fulfilled through Jesus, and the New Testament tells of the life of Jesus, the earliest days of the Christian church, letters of encouragement, and prophesies of what is to come.</p>
<h5><strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Roman Empire greatly impacted followers of Judaism</strong>. The Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonians in 586 B.C.E. The Second Temple was rebuilt as a replacement by 515 B.C.E. and was destroyed by Titus, the future emperor of Rome, in 70 C.E.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, synagogues rose to prominence as &#8220;little temples&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Synagogues</strong> adopted some of the functions of the destroyed Temple. <strong>Some synagogues were decorated with images depicting narratives from the Hebrew Bible</strong> beginning in the 3rd century C.E. The most extensive example discovered to date comes <strong>from the city of Dura-Europos</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>West Wall</strong></h5>
<p>The best-preserved part of the <strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue&#8217;s assembly hall is its west wall,</strong> with its focus on the niche that once held a wooden cabinet for the <strong>Torah</strong>. This is significant as it indicated the beginning of directional worship in Judaism. The west-facing niche enabled individuals to worship the scrolls and Jerusalem at the same time.</p>
<p>The <strong>three levels of narrative panels</strong> on the surrounding walls represent several scenes from the Hebrew Bible that recount the history of Israel in ways that connect to the Jewish community that worshipped there. A simple temple image marks the Torah shrine.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2416" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?resize=986%2C605&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="986" height="605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/West-wall-of-assembly-hall-with-view-of-Torah-shrine.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5><strong>The Exodus</strong></h5>
<p>In this detail from the <strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue paintings</strong>, we see part of the <strong>narrative in which the God of Israel delivered his people from slavery in Egypt by miraculously parting the Red Sea</strong> so that they could pass through. Like a Hebrew or Aramaic text, the <strong>narrative is read from right to left.</strong></p>
<p>Although <strong>Moses</strong> wields his staff, the presence of the large hands above—symbolic of the intervention of Israel&#8217;s God—is what truly has power to bring about the miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Dura-Europos Synagogue</strong> does not contain an image of Israel&#8217;s god. Instead, <strong>symbols indicate divine involvemen</strong>t in the narrative like the hands from above or images of fire.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2417" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?resize=990%2C605&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Exodus-Moses-and-Israelites-crossing-the-Red-Sea..jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Exodus (Moses and Israelites crossing the Red Sea).</strong></p>
<p>The Hebrew Bible depicts a nonphysical character of Israel&#8217;s god and contains various prohibitions against representing this god or creating images of other gods to worship, <strong>similar to aniconism in Islam</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Just a Book? Not Quite</strong></h5>
<p>One of the <strong>luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the illuminated manuscript</strong>. The earliest written documents were <strong>made of papyrus, parchment, or vellum and created in scroll form</strong> and functioned as an editable way <strong>to keep written text</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 1st century C.E., <strong>the codex</strong>, similar in format to a modern book, came into existence. A gathering of several sheets of folded vellum or parchment, this evolved in the 4th century to replace the scroll, as the scrolls were difficult to store and to access specific information quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The Vienna Genesis</strong> is a luxury manuscript made of <strong>purple dyed vellum with gold and silver writing</strong>. The <strong>purple dye is significant</strong>, as it was <strong>associated with royalty</strong>. Also was used to give imperial cloth its distinctive color—evidence of the high value placed on the manuscript.</p>
<p>It has several illuminations at the bottom of its pages. There is a continuous narrative, in a style similar to <em>Last judgment of Hu-Nefer</em>, recounting the story of Rebecca and Eliezer at the well, depicting the servant Eliezer finding a wife for Isaac, Abraham’s son.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2418" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?resize=600%2C766&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="766" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rebecca-and-Eliezer-at-the-Well-from-the-Vienna-Genesis.jpg?resize=235%2C300&amp;ssl=1 235w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well, from the Vienna Genesis</strong></p>
<p>In the first episode, Rebecca leaves the city of Nahor to draw water from the well. In the second episode, she offers water to Eliezer and his camels. The city of Nahor is portrayed as a walled city in the background, like cityscapes in Roman Second Style paintings. There is also a partially nude female sitting on the well, a personification of the spring source of the well water. Both are <strong>evidence of the classical motifs and stylistic influence in Early Christian art.</strong></p>
<p>Another page shows <em>Jacob Wrestling the Angel</em>, also in continuous narrative. There are several episodes depicting Jacob’s journey and his encounter with the angel going from left to right and then twisting around and back to the left. The artist has included vegetation and the twisting of the bridge behind and in front of the figures to help create the illusion of depth.</p>
<p>Christianity during the Middle Ages placed increasing emphasis on the power of the book.</p>

<h5><strong>Only the Wealthy</strong></h5>
<p>Wealth was the determining factor when it comes to illuminated manuscripts. These books were labor-intensive and comprised of expensive materials. They were valuable and commissioned by rulers and the wealthy. Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry was commissioned by the Duke of Berry, his name says it all—wealthy patron.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2420" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Coronation-Gospels-Codex..jpg?resize=600%2C758&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="758" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Coronation-Gospels-Codex..jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Coronation-Gospels-Codex..jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Coronation Gospels Codex</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illuminated manuscripts</strong> became some of the most valuable, portable objects of the time, not only because they were frequently <strong>embossed with gold and inlaid with gems</strong>, but because <strong>creating, possessing, and reading them were acts of piety</strong>.</p>
<p>Historians have been able to determine the wealth of a site simply according to the number of books produced.</p>
<p>Many <strong>illuminated manuscripts</strong> from the Carolingian Period are liturgies or <strong>Gospel Books: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John from the New Testament</strong>. Gospel Books were needed across the kingdom to meet the needs of newly built churches and monasteries.</p>
<p>These books were handwritten, illuminated, and authenticated as true to the original word. Illuminated Gospel Books were often used at a ruler’s coronation service, so many illuminated manuscripts became <strong>known as Coronation Gospels</strong>, and imperial patronage drove the production of illuminated manuscripts.</p>
<h5><strong>And the Empire Fell</strong></h5>
<p>The word <strong>medieval comes from the Latin medioaevum, meaning Middle Ages</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Medieval Period is the time between the end of classical Greco-Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Renaissance</strong>, the rebirth of classical civilization.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages can be defined, roughly, as the period in European history between the <strong>7th and the early 11th centuries C.E.</strong></p>
<p>Although <strong>medieval art</strong> has sometimes been dismissed as a barbarous decline from the standards of classical antiquity, <strong>the period produced many innovative and artistic forms of expression</strong>. Some of the earliest medieval art comes from the migration period. During this period, nomadic, nomadic non-Christian people (the <strong>Celts, Franks, Anglo–Saxons, and Vikings</strong>) produced art of great skill.</p>

<p>As the power of the Roman Empire receded during the 5th century C.E., the Franks settled in northern Gaul (France). The Merovingian Kingdom was the first French royal house.</p>

<p>During the late 8th century C.E., the Vikings came forth from Scandinavia and began to plunder parts of northern Europe. In some cases, they established colonies. The Vikings traveled as far as Novgorod in Russia and North America.</p>
<h5><strong>Funerary Objects, Medieval Style</strong></h5>
<p>As the power of the Roman Empire receded, non-Roman peoples began to settle across Europe. These peoples often had little familiarity with the classical tradition of artistic representation and, initially, were nomadic. Art produced was often portable, but of high quality and is categorized as animal-style art.</p>
<h5><strong>Portable is significant?</strong></h5>
<p>Yes. Portable means moveable. And, if moved far enough, it will impact another culture. And now you have another example of cross-cultural fertilization.</p>
<h5><strong>Purse cover</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Purse cover</strong>, metalworking, and other kinds of funerary objects were retrieved from the Sutton Hoo ship burial site, <strong>crafted in cloisonné</strong>, is characterized by two features:</p>
<p><strong>Interlace patterns</strong>: Interlace is derived from Roman ornamentation, but the heads of monsters are new additions.</p>
<p><strong>Animal motifs:</strong> Abstract depictions of animals have been woven together as part of the decorative patterns of the purse cover. The <strong>two motifs in the center portray falcons devouring ducks</strong>. The <strong>two outer motifs represent a human figure between two beasts</strong>, in a similar style as the Bull-headed lyre. Here, the male figures are abstracted almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The Anglo-Saxon treasures unearthed at Sutton Hoo have been described as one of &#8220;greatest archaeological discoveries of all time&#8221;. This discovery has been turned into Netflix film <em>The Dig</em> starring Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes.</p>
<h5><strong>Shoulder clasp</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Shoulder clasp</strong> (closed) retrieved from Sutton Hoo ship burial site consists of two curved parts connected with a pin that serves as a hinge. A panel on each side is <strong>decorated with millefiori </strong>insets. <strong>Interlace patterns</strong> around the borders of the clasp become <strong>serpents</strong>, which are staples of poetry from an early period in Ireland.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shoulder clasp</em> retrieved from Sutton Hoo ship burial site. Suffolk, England. ca. 625 C.E. Gold, garnet, and millefiori glass.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Animal head post</strong></h5>
<p>The ship from the Sutton Hoo burial site is in ruins. However, during a later period, another people, the Vikings, produced a fantastic ship that has been preserved. The 70-foot-long ship was used for burial and was covered over by a burial mound.</p>
<p>The <strong>Animal head post</strong> from the ship gives an idea of the intricacy of the ship’s decoration. Like the metal work from the Sutton Hoo burial site, it is decorated with a complex interlace design and the post becomes a beast intended to intimidate.</p>

<h5><strong>Merovingian looped fibula</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Merovingian looped fibula</strong> were likely the possessions of a wealthy Merovingian woman and were intended to accompany their owner into the afterlife. There are decorative patterns covering the entire surface of each of the fibulae.</p>
<p>These patterns adjust to the shape of the object, amplify the form and structure, and therefore become an organic part of the pins. A fish is incorporated below the center of each pin, and the looped forms around the edges are stylized eagles’ heads, evidence of the inclusion of abstract animal forms.</p>

<h5><strong>Manuscripts Brought to You From the British Isles</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Art of the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings</strong> served as the basis for some of the earliest Christian art in northern Europe. In addition to the Christian faith, Christian missionaries brought literacy to the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings. This led to the early medieval period production of the illuminated manuscript. The Gospel Book was quite popular.</p>
<p>Manuscripts from the British Isles reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.</p>
<p>They were produced in monasteries on the islands of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Another term sometimes used is <strong>Hiberno-Saxon art</strong>, a name that reflects the influence of the Irish monastic movement.</p>

<p><strong>The Arrest of Christ. Folio 114r. Book of Kells. ca. late 8th-early 9th century C.E. Tempera on vellum.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Book of Durrow </strong>is the earliest extant example of <strong>Hiberno-Saxon Gospel Books</strong>. It is <strong>named for the town in Ireland where it was kept</strong> in the later medieval period, but its <strong>origin is unknown</strong>.</p>
<p>One likely candidate is the monastery on Iona founded by St. Columba during the 6th century. Vikings attacked Iona during the late 8th century. It is possible that the book was taken to Durrow in the wake of this disaster.</p>

<p>Each of the gospels begins with an <strong>incipit page</strong>, in which lavish decoration emphasizes the first letter of the text. In this example, which opens the Gospel of Mark, <strong>the I</strong> and the first part of the &#8220;N&#8221; that <strong>begin the word Initium </strong>are composed of <strong>interlace patterns and Celtic spirals</strong> that resemble the patterns in metalwork from the arts produced by Celtic and Anglo-Saxon artisans.</p>
<p>The letters and words that follow grow smaller and less elaborate. In addition to beautifying a holy book, the incipit pages have the practical purpose of helping the reader locate sections in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Evangelist Symbol</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2426" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?resize=600%2C861&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="861" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?w=331&amp;ssl=1 331w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Evangelist-Symbol.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>PHOTO: Man, symbol for Saint Matthew. Folio 21 verso from the Book of Durrow. ca. 660–680 C.E. Ink and tempera on parchment</strong>.</p>
<p>Each gospel also begins with a full-page image containing an<strong> evangelist symbol</strong>. On this page, surrounded by an interlace border, the figure of a man looks like a checkerboard with legs and a head. He has the <strong>elements of Byzantine stylization: floating, flat, and frontal</strong>. The body of the man resembles the millefiori pattern of the shoulder clasp from Sutton Hoo.</p>
<p>The floating figure is flattened, with the legs shown from the side, whereas the head is positioned frontally. Despite the extreme stylization of the figure, there are also some realistic details—in particular, the figure is <strong>shown with the hairstyle of an Irish monk</strong>, with the head shaved at the front.</p>
<h5><strong>The Lindisfarne Gospels</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Lindisfarne Gospels</strong> were <strong>written in the monastery of Lindisfarne in England</strong> and remained there until Viking raiders drove the monks out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2427" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Matthew-cross-carpet-page..jpg?resize=600%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Matthew-cross-carpet-page..jpg?w=447&amp;ssl=1 447w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lindisfarne-Gospels-St.-Matthew-cross-carpet-page..jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Matthew, cross-carpet page.</strong></p>
<p>Like the <em>Book of Durrow</em>, it reflects the influence of migration period patterns. In this <strong>carpet page</strong>, we can see intricate interlace and millefiori patterns. Here the patterns have resolved themselves into a cross, as if this symbol of Christian faith had tamed the powers represented by the birds and other creatures that skulk in the margins.</p>

<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Luke incipit page.</strong></p>
<p>The Lindisfarne Gospels also include evangelist portraits, a type of image derived from early Roman Christian art. Indeed, there is strong evidence that the portraits may be copies, or at least variations on manuscript sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2429" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?resize=600%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?w=761&amp;ssl=1 761w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Luke-Portrait-Page.jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Lindisfarne Gospels: St. Luke portrait page.</strong></p>
<p>In this image, <strong>the evangelist Luke</strong> is clearly derived from Roman sources, but is remade in the visual idiom of the <strong>Hiberno-Saxon</strong> tradition. The image shows Matthew writing his gospel, and his symbol is depicted above him. The folds of Luke’s garments have been transformed into an abstract pattern, as have the evangelist’s locks of hair.</p>
<h5><strong>It’s All Narrative</strong></h5>
<p>You have experienced narrative art in different forms. The <em>Vienna Genesis</em> uses continuous narrative to recount biblical stories. The narrative of the <em>Column of Trajan</em> detailed Trajan’s victorious campaigns against the Dacians spiraling upward around the column. The <em>Ludovisi Battle Sarcophagus</em> uses forceful diagonals, dramatic contrasts, twisting figures, and emotional expressionism to convey the story of a chaotic battle scene between Romans and a northern enemy. How does art in other cultures express narrative?</p>

<p><strong>Battle of Romans and barbarians. Ludovisi Battle Sarcophagus. Late Imperial Roman. c. 250 C.E. Marble.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Bayeux Tapestry</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Bayeux Tapestry </strong>is not a real tapestry, in which figures are woven in with the thread, but <strong>an embroidered work of art,</strong> in which colored wool was stitched onto a linen background. It resembles a long comic strip made of cloth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The narrative style is a <strong>combination of pictographic Byzantine codices and Romanesque illumination.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>58 surviving scenes</strong> describe the history of the conflict, William of Normandy’s conquest, the Battle of Hastings, and the aftermath. The Battle of Hastings began when England&#8217;s King Edward the Confessor died in 1066 C.E. William of Normandy was a relative of King Edward, but Harold Godwinson was crowned king. That same year, William sailed for England, slew Harold in battle, and took the crown for himself.</p>
<p>In The Bad Omen episode of the <strong>Bayeux Tapestry</strong>, a comet flies above Harold&#8217;s palace, making its occupants uneasy. In medieval astrology, comets foretold unsettling events. This comet signifies the coming invasion of England.</p>
<p>This scene shares many aspects with illuminated manuscripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Latin words floating overhead are much like Byzantines&#8217; Greek interjections.</li>
<li>Large, bright blocks of color used in the clothing lend an almost cartoonish quality to the narratives, contrasting with the realistic presentation of the figures in the Column of Trajan.</li>
<li>The blocks of color are typical of Romanesque illumination and of most art of the period.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Battle of Hastings</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Narrow upper and lower registers frame the story, in contrast to the intertwined figures in the <strong>Ludovisi Battle Sarcophagus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elongation provides elegance</strong> and allows for the expanded portrayal of movement. Look how the pointing men use not only their hands, but also their entire bodies. The others&#8217; upraised hands speak of curiosity and concern. Even the architecture is stylized and elongated, arching high over the figures&#8217; heads like the churches of the era.</p>

<h5><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Medieval period</strong> is classified as <strong>the time between the end of classical Greco-Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Renaissance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medieval art was greatly impacted by the requirements of Jewish, Christian, or Islamic worship</strong>. One of the luxury arts found among the Early Christians was the <strong>illuminated manuscript</strong>. The art produced by nomadic, non-Roman peoples was often portable but of high quality and is <strong>categorized with animal-style art.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of <strong>metalworking and other kinds of funerary objects were found in the remains of a ship at the Sutton Hoo ship burial in Suffolk, England</strong>. Manuscripts from the British Isles like the <strong><em>Book of Kells, the Book of Durrow, </em></strong><em>and <strong>the Lindisfarne Gospels</strong></em> reflect both the design sensibilities of the animal style and the influence of Roman Christianity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Roman Inspiration</strong></h5>
<p>The term Romanesque describes architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Romanesque</strong> reflects certain Roman techniques, such as the <strong>barrel vault</strong> and the <strong>round arch</strong>. Several stylistic sources mark the Romanesque period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The legacy of Roman Imperial or Late Antique/Early Christian architecture and sculpture—seen in the use of Roman style masonry vaulting, rather than wooden roofs, and the reintroduction of monumental architectural sculpture in stone.</li>
<li>Continuity with the traditions of Carolingian and Ottonian art</li>
<li>The influence of Byzantine and Islamic art</li>
</ul>
<p>During the <strong>Romanesque</strong> period, the <strong>Holy Roman Empire</strong> included much of what is now Germany and Northern Italy. The<strong> Salian dynasty</strong> replaced the Ottonian dynasty in the 11th century; and the Ottonian and Early Christian influence is visible in architecture as masons began to adopt Romanesque innovations in masonry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Church of Sainte-Foy</em>.</strong></p>
<p><em>h of Sainte-Foy</em>.<span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">This influence extended beyond the Holy Roman Empire. Romanesque architecture was marked by experimentation and variety. As Romanesque was influenced, in turn Romanesque stylistic qualities influenced the early development of Gothic architecture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of the use of pointed windows to help distribute weight more efficiently</li>
<li>Early experimentation with vaulting techniques, such as groin vaults and the use of <strong>ribs</strong></li>
<li>Use of segmented units to construct a regular plan</li>
<li>Rhythmic elaboration of the interior elevation and <strong>nave arcade</strong></li>
<li>The addition of the east end of the church (as in the development of the pilgrimage choir)</li>
<li>The elaboration of Carolingian west work into a dramatic two-towered entrance</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Gothic, Not the Trend You Thought It Was</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Gothic period</strong>, known as the age of the great cathedrals, began in approximately 1150 C.E. and lasted until about 1400 C.E. Although it originated in France, the Gothic style spread throughout Western Europe to become the first truly International Style. The Gothic aesthetic encompassed a wide range of structures and media, including churches, palaces, and portraits.</p>
<p>Gothic architecture is best defined as the &#8220;quest for height and light&#8221;, considered to be an opposing pole to the Classical Greco-Roman styles in Europe. The heart of the Gothic aesthetic was the belief that divinity could be experienced through the senses, and Gothic architecture sought to connect viewers to the heavens with high, soaring vaults; bright, multicolored lights; and echoing sounds.</p>

<p><strong>The Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, exterior view of the west façade. Paris, France. ca. 1135–1140 C.E.</strong></p>
<p>The characteristic forms of Gothic emphasized and facilitated this heavenly encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>lofty masonry that reached toward the heavens</li>
<li>complex, ornate lines with elegant patterns</li>
<li>high, thin walls with great expanses of richly colored stained glass in large windows that allowed for extensive light</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>Elaborated architecture to support a socio-political development</p>
<p>Now that you know the characteristics—Gothic art and architecture is crazy elaborate—it’s time to move on to what it’s about: the social and political stuff.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1251" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101-The-Swing.jpg?resize=800%2C1034&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="1034" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101-The-Swing.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101-The-Swing.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Feminine vs. Masculine”</strong></h3>
<p>Interest in the small, delicate, and decorative was thought to be a feminine <strong>Rococo</strong> quality.  Ultimately, <strong>Neoclassicism</strong> emerged as a reaction to Rococo’s effeminate style. Neoclassicism is couched as a masculine celebration of the stoicism and restraint of classicism.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1700s)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Louis XIV’s court grew tired of the opulence after his death and left for Paris townhouses.</li>
<li>Bourgeoisie grew and so did the interest in art</li>
<li>18<sup>th</sup> century Enlightenment</li>
<li>Rejection of royal authority</li>
<li>Discovery of ruins at Herculaneum and Pompeii</li>
<li>1750s: Beginnings of English Industrial Revolution</li>
</ul>
<h5><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1240" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Early-1700s-Europe-Map.gif?resize=603%2C541&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="603" height="541" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Multiple styles emerged</strong> during this time. The French Royal Academy (Académie) dominated painting, training, and exhibitions (Salons). There was the initial triumph of <strong>Rubenistes</strong> <strong>over Poussinistes</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1768 the British Academy was created. Artists trained by drawing from live models.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> retained interest in <strong>classicism</strong>. Landscape architects were popular.</p>
<p><strong>Interior design</strong> featured furniture, clocks, and china.</p>
<h5><strong>The Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Enlightenment </strong>was a new philosophy and movement in Europe and the American colonies during the late 17<sup>th</sup> and early 18<sup>th</sup> century. (Age of Enlightenment, Age of Reason, emphasized rationalism)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominated by Neoclassicism drawing from ancient Greece and Rome</li>
<li>Neoclassicism started in 1760 and was opposite to the decadence of Baroque and Rococo styles</li>
<li>Neoclassism was especially dominant in architecture and sculpture for which artist had plenty to directly reference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rococo: </strong>18<sup>th</sup> century late art <strong>also known as Late Baroque</strong>. Rococo was once the most common art style. Later it was deemed frivolous and indulgent. Think artists <strong>Jean-Honoré Fragonard</strong> and <strong>François Boucher.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neoclassicism:  </strong>a Western movement influenced by ancient Greek and Rome within the decorative and visual arts, literature, theater, music, and architecture. Think artist <strong>Nicolas Poussin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enlightenment used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The power of reason</li>
<li>Philosophies sought to reform society</li>
<li>Intellectual exchange</li>
<li>A change from previous system such as the church or tradition</li>
<li>Science which started to displace the authority of religion</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Astronomy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Neoclassism used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity of Form</li>
<li>Sober colors</li>
<li>Strong horizontal lines</li>
<li>Shallow space</li>

<p>This painting entitled <strong><em>Fruits and Insects</em></strong> by <strong>Rachel Ruysch</strong> is a small <strong>oil on wood</strong> artwork, measuring just <strong>1 foot 4 by 2 feet.  </strong>Still lifes were valued for their extreme realism.</p>
<p>This work shows a profusion of <strong>scientifically accurate floral details</strong>. Look closely at the petals, stems, leaves. Tips are crinkled and brittle, with an emphasis of implied texture in the work.</p>
<p>Ruysch was known for her lively, informal arrangements. Most artists made symmetrical and formal compositions. Also, notice her use of the treatment of light she employs using <strong>tenebrism</strong>:</p>
<p>Scenes, like this one, were a collective observation of many plants and fruit, imaginatively compiled together to create a full composition. Historians know this because many of the components displayed together in still lifes, would not have been grown in the same season.</p>
<h5><strong>The Harvest Scene</strong></h5>
<p>The scene from <strong><em>Fruit and Insects </em></strong>is a harvest.  It features corn, squash, chestnuts, peaches, plum, grapes, wheat, eggs, and a butterfly. Looking at more minute details, one can also see a snail and a fly.</p>

<p>Christians would have seen the wheat as a reference to Eucharist, while the grapes as a symbol of alcohol. Insects play up on the fascination with science and microscopes at the time.</p>

<h5><strong>The Meaning Behind the Work </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Fruit and Insects </em></strong>was painted for Bavarian Prince Johann Wilhelm. He gave it as a gift to Cosimo de’ Medici III as a gift.</p>
<ul>
<li>Represents scientific interest in categorizing the natural world which was becoming popular.</li>
<li>Statement of status (implication is that patron owns all of this)</li>
<li>New affluent middle class desired new kinds of subjects.</li>
<li>They wanted art genres that would reflect their success with genre scenes, still lifes, portraits or landscapes.</li>
<li>No monarchy or Catholic Church in the Netherlands to commission religious or political art</li>
<li>Religious/moral message: <strong>vanitas</strong> (all of this is fleeting)</li>
<li>A reminder that relationship with God is the most important thing of all.</li>
<li>Flowers are iconographic statements of fleeting beauty and shortness of life.</li>
<li>Wealthy Dutch consumers were reminded to not be too attached to their material possessions and worldly pleasures.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Hierarchy of Genre </strong></h5>
<p>Still lifes were considered the lowest in the artistic world’s <strong>Hierarchy of Genre. </strong>It was the first genre students were expected to master. Artist rarely specialized in it. This was not so for female artists. This was as high as they were expected to go. Male counterparts believed they did not have the mental capacity for anything higher!</p>
<p>Painting was considered a hobby for women and not a profession. When women did learn how to paint they were often taught by their husbands or fathers. When they did succeed commercially, they were referred to as “lady painters.”</p>
<h5><strong>Career and Family </strong></h5>
<p>Ruysch was enormously successful in a 60-year career, producing over 250 paintings. For eight of those years, she was a court painter to the Bavarian court for eight years.</p>
<p>She also raised 10 children!</p>
<p>Ruysch grew up in Amsterdam, in a family of Dutch artists and scientist. Her father was a prominent scientist and specialized in botany. He possessed a collection of rare specimens, which she helped him catalogue and record.</p>
<p><strong>The Dutch Golden Age, in the 17<sup>th</sup> century</strong>, fueled an interest in exotic plants and flowers including “Tulip Mania”. Her paintings filled with observations and realistic replications were extremely popular.  And her works sold for double that which Rembrandt’s did at the time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Rococo </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Term derived from the French word <i>rocaille</i> (“shell”) and referred to the small shells used to decorate interiors.</li>
<li>After death of Louis XIV in 1715, French nobility left Versailles and reestablished themselves in Parisian townhouses</li>
<li>Reaction against severe, stuffy formality of Versailles</li>
<li>Secular Rococo interiors were purely intended to delight</li>
<li>Incorporated <strong>interior design</strong> for private viewings: <strong>small sculptures, mirrors, tapestries, elegant furniture, paintings</strong></li>
<li>Decorative; playful, light; graceful; delicate; often erotic</li>
<li><strong>Colors:</strong> white, silver, gold, light pinks, light blues, light greens</li>
<li><strong>Main artists: Watteau (begins Rococo with <i>fête </i><i>galante</i>), Boucher, Fragonard</strong></li>

<p>As the Rococo went out of style, women and femininity were blamed for “weakening” and effeminizing men and France at large.</p>
<p>This political cartoon depicts the frilly, effeminized Rococo painter who foolishly stands up to the strong, masculine, virile Neoclassical painters who represented the next artistic style to develop.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>In 1767 a painter named Doyen was approached by an unknown gentleman who asked the artist if he would come to meet him at his “pleasure house”. These were spaces for men to be with their mistresses. Upon arrival, the gentleman asked Doyen if he would paint his mistress on a swing that a bishop would push. The gentleman would be placed in such a way that he would be able to see up the skirt of his mistress.</p>
<p>Doyen declined by saying “well…thank you for thinking of me but I don’t really paint things like this. However, I know someone who does, and his name is <strong>Fragonard</strong>.”</p>
<p>This painting was the result!</p>
<p>It has been speculated that the patron may have been Baron de Saint-Julien.</p>
<h5><strong>Fun and Frivolity</strong></h5>
<p>This work celebrates the leisure of the upper class. It was painted to be erotically tantalizing. It was meant to represent a game. Gardens are for play. The couple is playing a game. We are playing the game by interpreting the painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Upon Closer Inspection</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>There is a lot going on in this work, which makes it an <strong>intrigue painting. </strong>A scene of scandal, playfulness, and flirtation, suggests a secret love affair. The patron/lover in lower left is looking up the skirt at the young lady who swings while a Bishop pushes her. This could be a possible comment on the corruption of the church.</p>
<p>The garden is fertile, abundant, growing out of control.  This is based on an <strong>English garden</strong>, with controlled and constructed outdoor spaces but have the appearance of being wild and natural, despite still being planned and arranged. Here the figures seem to be in a private park, hidden away.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconographic interpretation</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Swinging</strong> is an association with fickleness and female inconstancy. It is in reference to the act of lovemaking, but swinging is also a reference to a cheating lover.</p>
<p>The <strong>barking dog</strong> might be alluding us to the fact that the scene should be quiet and calm.  The dog does not symbolize fidelity here, rather impatience, carnal desire, animalistic urges, and arousal.</p>
<p>The <strong>pink roses</strong> are a symbol of female genitalia, as is the <strong>pink dress</strong> and shape of the opening.</p>
<p><strong>Shoe coming off</strong> is a common indication of lost virginity and one who has succumbed to passion.</p>
<p><strong>Man’s hat off </strong>at the end of a long slim arm<strong>,</strong> is a symbol of an erection.</p>
<p>The <strong>man is embedded in rose bush</strong> is a symbol of sex.</p>
<p><strong>Rake on the ground</strong> is similar to a crass term for male genitalia in French.</p>
<p>The <strong>shushing cupid</strong> is based on a statue that was in Madame de Pompadour’s home (a famous woman known for love) and heightens the illicit nature of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Dolphins </strong>are a reference to Venus because she was pulled to the shore by dolphins.</p>
<p><strong>Putti </strong>is Cupid’s friends sitting on top of the dolphin.</p>
<p><strong>The garden</strong> is fertile, abundant, and wild with unbridled passion.</p>
<h5><strong>Leisure of the French Aristocracy</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Indulgences</strong> that characterized the French aristocracy before the Revolution included the pursuit of pleasure, and playfulness. Games were very popular. This calls attention to the amount of leisure time they had. Games were also symbols of the poor. It was trendy to “play” poor and simple, like farm girls and peasant boys.</p>
<p>The strict rules of conduct were loosened in these societal situations. Additionally, by participating in these activities, aristocrats believed they received health benefits or relaxation, while stimulating both their senses and intellect. This combated boredom!</p>
<p><strong>Public parks</strong> and <strong>private gardens</strong> were increasingly popular. These were places where flirtatious physical interactions were allowed.</p>
<h5><strong>Aristocrats, Status and Art </strong></h5>
<p>Artistic renderings of aristocrats playing and being frivolous were very popular. Showcasing such works was a sign of status. By definition, aristocrats did not have jobs. They existed to express their status.</p>
<p>There was also a new element of freedom. After the French Revolution and the death of Louis XIV the aristocrats who had previously lived in the rigid ceremonial world of the king, were now free to celebrate themselves.</p>
<h4><strong>Enlightenment</strong></h4>

<li>Philosophical and intellectual movement in Europe</li>
<li>Main ideas:
<ul>
<li><strong>Use of reason, rather than tradition or authority</strong></li>
<li>Importance of governmental protection of human rights</li>
<li>Dislike of traditional beliefs based in divine intervention</li>
<li>Importance of scientific questioning</li>
<li>Democratization of knowledge, a deep-seated belief in education and the individual à <em>Encyclopédie</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery </em></strong>by artist <strong>Joseph Wright of Derby</strong>, is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> large work measuring <strong>4 feet 10 inches by six feet eight inches</strong>. We would expect to see a history painting in this size, but here the artist is trying to aggrandize the sitters.</p>
<p><strong>Tenebrism</strong> is used for dramatic effect, although it is not religious in content. There is dramatic lighting and scale in a closely packed space, with a Strong internal light source</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong> are painted with extreme <strong>realis</strong>m. (He was criticized for painting people too realistically!) The figures are pushed forward on a picture plane and tightly packed. The philosopher in the middle is obvious, in the center, with the brightest lighting and wearing deep red. Often, <strong>conversation portraits</strong> (images of people sitting around together) were popular and were formally arranged. Wright of Derby was famous for his natural and informal arrangements.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work promotes a belief in science. It is an empirical observation grounded in science and reason that could best advance society. This is still about conversion (light symbolizes conversion) and transformation, but rather unlike <em>Calling of St. Matthew</em> where the conversion is to religion, we are witnessing a conversion to science.</p>
<p>This makes the argument that art and science go together. Artwork shows the power of science. Rachel Ruysch’s work did the same.</p>
<p>The artist took a history painting (large, noble, aggrandizing method) and applied it to a composition with a contemporary secular subject.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery</em></strong><em>, </em>depicts the moment of epiphany or transformation. Here people are witnessing the truth of science. The message is that science is for everyone – look at the wide variety of people who witness this event.</p>
<p>Notice all the figures are seated in a circle around the orrery which emits a central light source.</p>
<ul>
<li>All faces represent different phases of the moon – clever reference to the Lunar Society.</li>
<li>Two young boys gaze over the edge.</li>
<li>A teenage girl rests on the machine, concentrating.</li>
<li>A young man shields his eyes.</li>
<li>A woman stares intently.</li>
<li>A standing man takes notes.</li>
<li>The philosopher stands over the orrery (likely based on Sir Isaac Newton’s portrait – who had died in 1727). Notice the formal devices that make him stand out to us.</li>
<li>Bookshelves in the back indicates he is very educated.</li>
<li>An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system
<ul>
<li>A miniature clockwork planetarium.</li>
<li>Each planet with its moons is a sphere attached to an arm that rotates around the sun when cranked by hand.</li>
<li>Can simulate eclipses and illustrate the rotation of the planets.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Enlightenment</strong> was an 18<sup>th</sup> century philosophical movement that shifted Europe away from traditional religious models and moved towards an empirical, scientific approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Science &gt; religion</li>
<li>Knowledge is for everyone, and knowledge should be democratic.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>English painter <strong>Joseph Wright of Derby (1734 – 1829)</strong> added the region he was born to his professional name, because there was another painter named Joseph Wright, who also lived close by.</p>
<p>Joseph Wright of Derby became the unofficial painter of the Enlightenment. He was known for depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods. The artist belonged to a scientific group called the Lunar Society of Birmingham. This was an informal group that met to talk about scientific topics of the day (Erasmus Darwin – grandfather of Charles Darwin was a member of this group).</p>

<p><strong><em>Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</em></strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas work</strong>, attributed to <strong>Juan Rodríguez Juárez</strong>. This is an example of an early <strong>casta painting</strong>, depicting inter ethnic mixing of the Europeans and indigenous people of New Spain. It belongs to a larger series of works.</p>
<p>These are not portraits, but characters from the artist’s imagination. The artwork helps to illustrate life in the New World. In the artist earlier works, from which this is an example, he depicts the figures as wealthy and distinguished.</p>
<p>The space in the painting is not defined. This allows the viewer to focus on the figures entirely. These are painted naturally and realistically.</p>
<h5><strong>Marketplace for Casta Paintings </strong></h5>
<p>These works were commissioned by elite Europeans. Many series were commissioned by viceroys. These were to be given to Spanish rulers to illustrate the racial and ethnic mixings in the New World.</p>
<h5><strong>Racism in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>A series of casta paintings usually contained 16 paintings or even 16 vignettes within one painting. The first in a series showed a European man with an elite indigenous woman and their child or <strong>mestizo</strong>, or racial mix.</p>
<p>As the family trees progressed in additional paintings and races continued to mix, the figures appeared less prominent and wealthy, and they appeared to have a darker skin tone.</p>
<p>Clothing, accoutrements, activities all aid in racially labeling the people in the work. All are numbered with text inscriptions, on the front or back, that label the races in the work.</p>
<p>All the above indicated society’s notion that social status, wealth, and overall worth were directly tied to race.</p>
<h5><strong>A Plus B Equals C</strong></h5>
<p>This image is the first in the series, depicting a husband, wife, and child. This is modeled after depictions of the Holy Family showing the Virgin, St. Joseph, and Christ.</p>
<p>The European father wears French-style European clothing complete with a powdered wig. The indigenous mother is dressed in a <strong>huipl</strong>, a traditional woman’s garment worn by indigenous women from central Mexico. It has lace sleeves. Her sumptuous jewelry indicates to the viewer that she is an aristocratic native. The two types of dress styles help to carry the subject matter of blended families forward.</p>
<p>The child is a racial mix of both parents. The family appears calm, harmonious, and loving. A young servant holds the child while looking up to the baby’s father.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sociedad de Castas</strong> was the racial hierarchy developed in the New World to alleviate social anxieties over mixed-race people. European whites, New World whites, mestizos, indigenous peoples, mulattos, zambos, and African, were some of the descriptions used.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Casta paintings</strong> spoke to Enlightenment concerns, or specifically, the notion that people can be categorized racially based on ethnic makeup and appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Taste for the Natural</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The taste for the natural</strong> was promoted by the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. There was an</p>
<p>interest in the ‘natural’ as opposed to the ‘artificial’. This was a rejection of Baroque artificiality,</p>
<p>and emphasized relaxed, elegant poses and  tall figures with low horizon lines.</p>
<p>The taste for natural promoted the “cult of sensibility” and “cult of domesticity”. Values included sentimentality, emotion, naturalism, and virtue.</p>
<p>Grand Manner portraits dominated, especially in England. This combined Rococo delicacy with classical allusions.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Uffizi</p>
<p><strong><em>Self-portrait</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Elisabeth Louise Vigée-Lebrun </strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 6 inches. </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What does by “The Natural” mean? </strong></h5>
<p>This is not a real style but rather a way of thinking about a trend in portraiture. In fact, these images were designed to look as relaxed, natural, and effortless as possible. This was becoming enormously popular as artists and patrons disliked the pomp, circumstance, and opulence of the Baroque era.</p>
<p>Here you will observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual elegance</li>
<li>Precise nonchalance or contrived to look effortless</li>
<li>Idealized (she was much older here than she appears)</li>
<li><strong>Self-portrait</strong></li>
<li>Well lit, up front towards the picture plane, attention to fabrics is great</li>
</ul>
<p>This<strong> “Natural” </strong>work also uses<strong> Grand Manner Portraiture. </strong>This helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggrandize the sitter</li>
<li>Make them large, in the forefront</li>
<li>Appear gently idealized</li>
<li>Casual yet composed (“studied nonchalance”)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created after <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong> had fled France, following the French Revolution. She was in danger as <strong>a well-known royalist.</strong> She painted it for the Uffizi Gallery in Florence as an addition to their collection of well-known artists’ self-portraits. This put her in league with male painters.</p>

<p>She was able to occupy in a non-threatening manner both worlds&#8211;the world of artists, dominated by men, and the world of femininity.  She shows she can paint just as well as men, and is even friendly with royalty. But, she is not a threat because of her great femininity. She is pretty, demure, soft, gentle, and sophisticated.</p>
<p>Female artists had to traverse a very fine line of showing their talent to be equal to a man, but consoling men and calming them by reminding them that their genders were quite different.</p>
<p>Critics called the artist vain and self-important.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong> was 35 when this was painted. She is looking at the viewer as she paints a portrait of Marie Antoinette. She was Queen Marie Antoinette’s official court painter and personal friend.</p>
<p>In the painting she sits in a relaxed pose at her easel. She looks very pretty. Her skin looks soft, with rosy cheeks, gentle curls, piercing eyes, and flowing silk. She wears a white turban and dark dress with a soft white ruffled collar – in the free-flowing Grecian style. This was inspired by the style that Marie-Antoinette had made popular at the French court. Certainly, not an outfit a painter would paint in. Yet, the brushes are ready along with a palette.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In 1783, <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong>, who specialized in portraiture, was admitted to the French Royal Academy, as the first female member.  Her entrance however was orchestrated by her most important patron&#8211; Marie Antoinette! Now, she certainly deserved to be there, but to many men, it looked like one corrupt woman pulling strings for another woman.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette was deeply disliked at this point in France. Many artists and writers argued that it was Rococo, and by extension women in general, who were leading France down the road to decay.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette, the Rococo excesses, indeed femininity in general, was criticized for having made France and men effeminate. This was blamed for all of France’s problems (debt, corruption, a weak Louis XVI, and a deeply disliked Marie Antoinette). Many believed the only way to end this was revolution.</p>
<p>When the French Revolution occurred, <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong>, had to flee and escape. This work was created soon after her departure from France.</p>
<p>The artist ended up traveling to Italy and Russia to paint nobility and royalty. She was enormously famous in her life and ended up writing an autobiography.</p>

<p><strong><em>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</em></strong> by artist<strong> Miguel Cabrera is an </strong><strong>oil on canvas work </strong>set in realistic space. There is a naturalistic treatment of the body, and it is well-proportioned.   Note the use of variety in the background with color and implied texture.</p>
<p>Once again, we see the “Natural” style with some Grand Manner techniques mixed in. The work is casual, relaxed, and elegant, with a low horizon line, pushed forward, and a larger figure.</p>
<p>We can see the quality of artists have improved over works such <em>Angel with Arquebus</em>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This portrait insists on her status as an intellectual as well as a nun. It ennobles her as an intelligent and pious woman. The work also commemorates Sor Juana 55 years after her death, for admirers, who were likely supporters of Jeronymite order. She was obviously quite a famous Jeronymite nun.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is a famous depiction of the esteemed Mexican nun and writer. Cabrera modeled this painting on images of male scholars seated at their desks.</p>
<p>She wears the <strong>habit</strong> of her religious order and an <strong>escudo de monja</strong> (nun’s badge) on her chest (similar to Sin Sukju). This displayed the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation.</p>
<p>Her <strong>left-hand</strong> toys with her rosary, while she turns a page of an open book with <strong>her right hand</strong>. The book is a text by St. Jerome. This is a contrast between her religious life (rosary) and her intellectual life (books).</p>
<p>She looks towards us, her gaze direct and assertive, as she sits at a desk in her library. We see books on philosophy, natural science, theology, mythology and history.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong>Sor Juana</strong> was born a </span><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">creole</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> (Europeans born in New World) in 1648.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>At age 15, she amazed people at court by excelling at an oral exam that tested physics, philosophy, theology, math, poetry and plays.</li>
<li>Her reward was to live as a lady in waiting at the Viceroy’s House
<ul>
<li>She hated it and soon became a nun to avoid a wedding</li>
<li>Joined Jeronymite order in 1669 as a nun (named for St. Jerome)</li>
<li>In privileged Mexican convents, nuns lived in comfort with servants and households</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She corresponded with scientists, theologians, and other intellectuals, and was a writer</li>
<li>In 1690, she became involved in an ecclesiastical dispute between the bishops of Mexico City and Puebla.
<ul>
<li>She told them they were both wrong and proposed an answer and garnered criticism.</li>
<li>She responded to the criticism she received as a woman writer in a text called <em>The Answer </em>which defended her right as a woman to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite her eloquent defence, the Church forced her to relinquish her literary pursuits and library.
<ul>
<li>She was forced to sell her library, musical and scientific instruments.</li>
<li>She had to write a document that renounced her learning which ended with “I, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the worst in the world” and signed it with her own blood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She fell sick and passed away in 1695 after caring for plague victims.</li>

<p><strong><em>The Tête à Tête </em></strong><strong>from <em>Marriage à la Mode </em></strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> painting by artist <strong>William Hogarth</strong>, measuring  <strong>2 feet and 2 inches by 3 feet. </strong>Hogarth made these oil paintings with an intent to turn them into prints that could be sold to the masses at a reduced rate.</p>
<p>He used <strong>satire</strong> or humor to make a criticism of contemporary lifestyles of the upper classes. He could do this because his was selling the prints to the middle classes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marriage à la Mode </em></strong>means Marriage of the Day or Modern Marriage</p>
<h5><strong><em>Image 1 (Marriage Contract)</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord Squanderfield</strong> has a title but no money. He has squandered  his aristocratic fortunes. Pointing to his family tree, with a medieval knight suggesting a great lineage, he sits with a gout-ridden foot made worse with inactivity. There are Old Master’s paintings on the walls and construction going on outdoors in the new Palladian style.</p>
<p>Here, also sits <strong>a wealthy merchant</strong> without a title. <strong>Lord Squanderfield’s son</strong> and the <strong>merchant’s daughter</strong> are going to marry.</p>
<p>Young Squanderfield is picking snuff out of a box, while looking in the mirror at his own reflection. He has his back turned toward his soon to be bride, with disinterest. Black velvet patches cover syphilis marks.</p>
<p>The daughter sits frumpily and slumped over to show a lack of intelligence, while being wooed by <strong>Silvertongue, her father’s lawyer.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Image 2 (The Tete a Tete) </strong></h5>
<p>Tete to Tete means “head-to-head” or “face to face”.</p>
<p>Shortly after the marriage, each partner has been pursuing pleasures without the other. The <strong>husband</strong> has been out all night with another woman and gambling. The dog sniffs at a bonnet in his jacket, as if assessing what the husband has been up to. The man looks tired and upset. There is a broken sword underneath him indicating a loss.</p>
<p>The <strong>wife</strong> has been playing cards all night. Her bodice is undone. She is yawning. Slyly she is looking out of the corner of her eye to see if he notices. Her lover has just left in a hurry! Notice the turned over chair. The violin player has made a hasty retreat. Violins were symbols of sexual pleasure, in old medieval reference, alluding to what has just taken place.</p>
<p>The <strong>accountant</strong> wears a frustrated expression. He throws his hands up in the air. She has lost a fortune at cards. He just cannot get this couple to take their finances seriously.</p>
<p>The chandelier’s candles have just gone out. They have been burning all evening.  A sculpture with a broken nose has been knocked over on the fireplace mantle. This indicates that although the couple have nice things, they do not bother to take care of them.</p>
<p>There is a nude painting on the back wall, next to three paintings of saints. The nude is covered with a cloth, but it is still visible. It has been covered in a haphazardly way, just like her affair!</p>
<p>A <strong>servant </strong>is yawning in the back room, while rearranging the chairs.</p>
<h5><strong>Image 3 (The Inspection)</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Young Squanderfield</strong>, suffering from syphilis, makes a visit to a <strong>doctor</strong>. Notice the black patches on his neck. Brandishing his cane, he shows the doctor the black mercury pills that do not work.</p>
<p>A <strong>sickly girl</strong> stands in front of him weeping. They both have the disease. The <strong>tall woman</strong> may be her mother or a madame.</p>
<p>The doctor too is riddled with disease.  His office is full of curiosities, including a skull. This could be symbolizing that the disease can cause death.</p>
<h5><strong>Image 4 (The Toilette) </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Lord Squanderfield has died. <strong>Young Squandefield is now the Earl,</strong> and <strong>his wife is now the Countess.</strong></p>
<p>In keeping with the height of fashion, Countess holds a toilette. <strong>Lawyer Silvertongue</strong> lounges, with his shoes off and feet up looking comfortable.</p>
<p>Silvertongue tries to get Countess to attend a masquerade with him because no one will know who they are. Beside him is a book called <em>The Sofa</em>, which was a common erotic novel of the day. There is a coral rope used for teething on the chair where the Countess sits. The baby is not in the artwork to illustrate her poor maternal skills.</p>
<p>The Old Masters’ paintings hanging depict Lot and His Daughters (incest), Jupiter and Io (seduction), and Rape of Ganymede (homosexual seduction).</p>
<h5><strong>Image 5 (The Bagnio)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Squanderfield</strong> catches his <strong>wife</strong> with her lover, <strong>Silvertongue</strong>, in a bagnio, or inn, where rooms could be taken without questions asked. The Earl has burst into the room to find an unmade bed, recently used.</p>
<p>Squanderfield is fatally wounded by Silvertongue, who escapes.  A sword is on the floor The Earl is now dying, while Countess pleads for forgiveness.</p>
<p>The noise has awakened the inn. The Judgment of Solomon on the wall foreshadowing the inevitable destruction of all involved.</p>
<h5><strong>Image 6 (The Lady’s Death)</strong></h5>
<p>Countess returns after her husband’s murder only to commit suicide after Silvertongue is hung for murder. The newspapers on the floor tell the viewer of the hanging.</p>
<p>The child’s legs have braces indicating she has rickets. This was understood at the time to be associated with overindulgence. She also has a black patch, indicating her misfortune of contracting syphilis from her parents. This family tree will come to a tragic end.</p>
<p>The merchant removes the rings from his daughter’s fingers before rigor mortis sets in.</p>
<h4><strong>Social History of the Period</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Marriages in the past had been arranged for economic benefits. However, with the 18<sup>th</sup> century marriages started to be based around love and affection.  <strong>This collection of works showed the downfall of an arranged marriage.</strong></p>

<p>In the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution, the landed aristocracy was losing power to a new upper-middle merchant class or <strong>bourgeoisie. </strong> An increasingly large middle class wanted to buy art  prints.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>English artist <strong>William Hogarth (1697-1764)</strong> trained as a silver engraver and print maker before becoming an artist. His work in oils was self taught.</p>
<p>Hogarth was known for tackling controversial topics. Beer Street and Gin Street were two engraving prints that drew focus to society’s alcoholism.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>Neoclassicism</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Neoclassicism </strong>is a style of art and architecture that emerged in the later 18<sup>th</sup> century as part of a general revival of interest in classical cultures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel to the picture plane</strong></li>
<li><strong>Symmetrical</strong></li>
<li><strong>Linear perspective</strong></li>
<li><strong>invisible brushwork</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clarity of detail</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neoclassical artists</strong> adopted themes and styles from ancient Greece and Rome.  This was Taught within academies, and it returned to Poussinistes.</p>
<p>Grand Tours promoted the value of studying in Italy (Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice)</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the precepts of the Enlightenment</li>
<li>Johann Winckelmann’s books of art theory</li>
<li>1748: Excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii which were Roman cities destroyed by volcanic eruption in 79 CE.</li>
<li>1764: Johann Winckelmann’s <em>History of Ancient Art</em> criticized the excesses of Rococo and celebrated the ancients for their clarity and restraint.</li>

<p><strong><em>Oath of the Horatii</em></strong> an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> <strong>Neoclassical</strong> work by <strong>Jacques-Louis David </strong>measures<strong> 10 feet and 8 inches by 14 feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Neoclassicism include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classical subject</strong> AKA history painting</li>
<li><strong>Classical</strong> <strong>setting</strong> and architecture and clothing</li>
<li><strong>Figures are parallel</strong> to picture plane, pushed forward like a Roman relief, set in a Roman atrium dominated by three arches at the back, and uses Doric order.</li>
<li>Idealized</li>
<li>Linear perspective</li>
<li><strong>Licked finish</strong> using invisible brushstrokes so small it is as if a cat licked it.</li>
<li>History painting is large size, low horizon line, idealized and large figures, didactic, historical subject.</li>
<li>Tripartite composition</li>
<li>Men: vigorous, powerful, animated, emphatic, muscled arms in rigid salute; comprised of straight strong lines</li>
<li>Women are curvilinear, soft, rounded, collapsed, slumped</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Made for a King</strong></h5>
<p>The patron was <strong>Louis XVI</strong>. France was on the brink of revolution. Louis wanted this to be a statement of loyalty to the monarchy, and he loved this work when it was exhibited.</p>
<h5><strong>Fixing Society Through Art</strong></h5>
<p>David had other ideas – he wanted it to rally republicans as opposed to monarchists. He painted this in Rome after looking at ancient Roman sculpture, paintings, and friezes.  He believed the classics were superior. David wanted to return ancient masculinity and strength to France to reject the frilly, decadent Rococo.</p>
<h5><strong>Political Self-Sacrifice</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Great change will take great sacrifice and great loss. It is still necessary</li>
<li>Must make sacrifices for the greater good</li>
<li>Willingness to die for a principal</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Exemplum virtutis</strong> is a painting that depicts a bold or powerful model of virtue or a didactic moral message.</p>
<p>The story of <strong><em>Oath of Horatii</em></strong> is a legend that was discussed by Roman historian Livy. It is about a conflict between the Romans and rivals in the nearby Alba. The warring had reached a stalemate. To prevent further deaths, three combatants from both sides pledged to fight on behalf of the cities. The Romans selects the three Horatii brothers while the Albans choose the three Curatii brothers.</p>
<p>One of the women on the right is a Horatii engaged to marry a Curatii. One of the sisters of the Curatii is married to a Horatii.</p>

<p>The message is there will be inevitable loss, but you still must make these sacrifices.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>This is the first Neoclassical painting and the birth of Neoclassicism. </strong></p>
<p>In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome, the prize awarded to the best Academy artist. He was able to go to Rome for five years, and study art&#8212; all expenses paid!</p>
<p>After returning, his work was severely undecorated, anti-Rococo, extolled virtues of stoicism, masculinity, patriotism and honor. This was the reaction against the femininity, vanity, lasciviousness, and pleasure pursuing of Rococo.</p>
<p>He exhibited this in at the Salon of 1785 and people were amazed. They had never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>As part of the Neoclassical revival of classical antiquity,</strong> David arranged his figures parallel to the picture plane in the manner of a Greek frieze as seen here with <i>Plaque of the </i><i>Ergastines.</i></p>

<p><strong>Jacques-Louis David (1746-1825)</strong> was a French painter in the Neoclassical style. He was an active supporter of the French Revolution.  He was essentially an art mercenary! He would paint for whoever was in power at that moment. The work above was commissioned for Louis XVI. The artists painted it even though he personally agreed with revolutionaries. Ultimately, he painted Napoléon!</p>

<p><strong><em>George Washington</em></strong><em> a</em><strong><em> marble </em></strong><em>work by</em> <strong>Jean-Antoine Houdon </strong>is a life-sized sculpture standing<strong> 6 feet 2 inches. </strong> It is <strong>Neoclassical</strong> in style, but the American version is “down to earth,” simple, and less dramatic.</p>
<p>Based on Polykleitos’ Doryphoros</p>
<ul>
<li>Revives the restraint and idealism and control of classical Greek art (rationalism)</li>
<li>His stance mimics that of the <strong>contrapposto</strong>; sculpture in the round</li>
<li>Idealized, noble, casual pose</li>
<li>Alternation of tense/relaxed; straight/bent</li>
<li>Left as bare marble à recalls the idealization and simplicity of classical statuary</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was designed to commemorate <strong>George Washington</strong>. Its aim was to show that a legendary leader was also an ideal leader, capturing the <strong>duality</strong>. He was a humble private citizen and an honorable public servant.</p>
<p>This was commissioned by the Virginia legislature and installed in the capitol rotunda in 1796. This was the year Washington gave his farewell address.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This shows George Washington as a public servant. He does not wear a toga or other classical garment, but instead wears his military uniform.</p>
<p>Left arm rests atop a <strong>fasces</strong> (where the word fascism comes from). This is meant to invoke a classical column. Fasces was given to Roman slaves to symbolize their freedom.</p>
<p>The <strong>bundle of 13 rods</strong> symbolizes the original colonies. His hand rests on top showing that he unifies these colonies but also that he draws strength from them. This visually represents the concept of E Pluribus Unum – Out of Many, One. (Congress approved this in 1782)</p>
<p>Does not hold <strong>his officer’s sword</strong>, it hangs on the outside of the fasces, just outside his reach. This signifies he can be strong but should not immediately resort to this.</p>
<p>He is a private citizen. The plow rests behind Washington and reminds us that he is a simple man tied to the earth. This refers to the story of Roman dictator Cincinnatus, who resigned when his leadership, so he could return to his farm (rather than Caesar who created absolute power for himself). This parallel shows how Washington turned down the office and stepped away from the Presidency.</p>
<p>The <strong>walking stick</strong> symbolizes that Washington was well-known as a man who loved to stroll his estate. This is evidence that power does not have to corrupt</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>After the end of the Revolutionary War, the new American government turned to public art to commemorate the occasion and develop an American identity</li>
<li>European sculptor had to be sought out since there was a lack of artistic talent in US colonies
<ul>
<li>Jefferson, ambassador to France, suggested Jean-Antoine Houdon</li>
<li>Houdon went to the Academy in Paris and won the Prix de Rome in 1761. He was famous neoclassical sculptor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you create a new nation’s imagery/symbols? What is art’s role in this?</li>
<li>Houdon created an idealized, classical bust of Washington</li>
<li>Washington didn’t like it and insisted on being shown in contemporary attire</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monticello </strong>created by<strong> Thomas Jefferson </strong>is a structure crafted with<strong> brick, glass, stone, and wood. </strong>It is in<strong> Virginia, US. </strong>The floor plan is not very Neoclassical. Jefferson planned this part before he was influenced by Neoclassicism, but by then it had already been built.</p>
<p>Monticello was inspired by Palladian classicism (Villa Rotunda) and Pantheon.</p>
<p>The <strong>west garden façade view</strong> has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetrical three-story brick home, balanced</li>
<li>Doric entablature; two-column extended portico; four Doric columns wide</li>
<li>Triangular pediment decorated by a semi-circular window</li>
<li>Octagonal drum and shallow dome</li>
<li>Wooden balustrade that circles roofline</li>
<li>Brick building, stucco applied to give the look of marble</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Made from Scratch</strong></h5>
<p>Jefferson chose to make his own bricks from the clay on his land. He used local timber, stone, and locally made nails. This saved him a great deal of money&#8212; as did the slave labor!</p>
<h5><strong>Symmetrical Interior Design</strong></h5>
<p>The numerous, tall French doors and windows allow for circulation in humid Virginia.</p>
<p>Jefferson was obsessed with saving space. There is a very narrow spiral staircase. Beds are in alcoves or in walls.</p>
<p>As he disliked dark and cold corners, he preferred a nice octagonal room.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This was both a<strong> domestic space </strong>and a<strong> private space, </strong>as it was a plantation home.<strong>  </strong>It was built for comfort, entertainment, personal style. These were new ideas. The fact that architecture could display these things was a new and very modern idea in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<h5><strong>Picking A Style</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Jefferson’s choice was sure to display religious and political ideas. He needed to choose carefully and avoid certain styles.</p>
<p><strong>French Baroque</strong> would have connections to Louis XIV and absolutism. Jefferson felt <strong>English Baroque</strong> was too British for an American audience.  <strong>Italian Baroque </strong>was considered too Catholic and religious, and Jefferson did not want to set a religious precedent. <strong>Rococo</strong> was too frilly, playful, and lacked seriousness.</p>
<p><strong>Neoclassicism</strong> embodied democracy, aspirations, the classics, freedom, and civic pride. It symbolized a return to <strong>democratic traditions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jefferson believed art was a powerful tool and could encourage American aspirations.</li>
<li>Classics symbolized aspirations of the new American republic.</li>
<li>Classics symbolized America was the inheritor of classical democracy.</li>
<li>Classics invoked ideas regarding freedom, self-determination, prosperity, education, democracy, and civic responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Jefferson was one of the earliest supporters of <strong>Neoclassical architecture</strong> in US. He was considered a “gentleman architect”, who was not a professional but highly educated.</p>
<h5><strong>Timeline</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1768:</strong> Construction begins. The hill was cleared and leveled through slave labor.</p>
<p><strong>1771:</strong>  First phase (foundation) was completed (Neoclassicism hasn’t been invented yet).</p>
<p><strong>1784-1789</strong>: Jefferson left for France as an American minister. He observed Neoclassicism in France/Italy.</p>
<p><strong>1789:</strong></p>
<p>Returned to Monticello and began to redesign it along French neoclassicism lines. He was already stuck with a floorplan which is not very Neoclassical. But he changed the interior and exterior design to add Neoclassical elements</p>
<p><strong>1809:</strong> The house was finished.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1301" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/17th-century-Northern-Baroque.png?resize=990%2C558&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="558" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/17th-century-Northern-Baroque.png?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/17th-century-Northern-Baroque.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/17th-century-Northern-Baroque.png?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/17th-century-Northern-Baroque.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “New Subjects for a New Clientele”</strong></h3>
<p>Northern Europe was deeply – and mostly – Protestant.  As such, the Catholic Church no longer acted as a premier patron.  Instead, absolutist monarchs (Louis XIV, Charles I) and a wealthy Dutch mercantile class sought out new kinds of images: portraits, still lifes, genre paintings, landscapes, etc.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1600-1700)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648): Catholic HRE vs. German Protestant kings caused devastating losses of life and economic vitality</span>
<ul>
<li>Disruption of Catholic Church’s power and control. By 1650, France dominates European politics and artistic patronage (Louis XIV)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scientific Revolution during the 17<sup>th</sup> century saw the introduction of physics, along with the increased awareness of space and matter in motion.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Classicists</strong> (also called Poussinsites) were inspired by <strong>Raphael</strong>. These artists used order, use of line and clarity. <strong>Naturalists</strong> (also called Rubenistes) were inspired by <strong>Titian</strong> and used color, energy, and vibrancy.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>There were now new types of paintings, from genre paintings to landscape and still lifes. More than 500 painters in Holland worked exclusively of just still life paintings. There was an enormous demand for art.</p>
<p>Landscapes were treated naturally, although mostly still constructions.</p>
<p><strong>Northern paintings all share similar qualities from the Renaissance to Baroque era: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>small scale</li>
<li>vivid color</li>
<li>interest in extreme detail</li>
<li>iconography</li>
<li>genre scenes</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Architecture </strong></h5>
<p>Architecture during this time was grand, impressive, and displayed a knowledge of classicism.</p>
<p>Protestant churches built at the time did not utilize art in the manner of Catholic churches.</p>
<h5><strong>Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>This was not a period of sculptural works. In fact, sculpture all but disappeared.</p>

<h5><strong>Dutch Baroque (1610-1670)</strong></h5>
<p>In the 15<sup>th</sup> century, the Netherlands were controlled by Duke of Burgundy of France. Then, in the early 16<sup>th</sup> century HRE Charles V annexed Netherlands and declared Spanish King Philip II as sovereign</p>
<p>In 1568 the <strong>Eighty Years’ War </strong>started.</p>
<p>In 1579 the United Netherlands (Northern) formed. This was a <strong>break away from Spanish Catholic control</strong>. They become an independent <strong>Protestant </strong>country called the Dutch Republic.</p>
<p>The war continued until 1648 when Philip IV recognizes independence</p>
<p>Spain retained the <strong>Southern Netherlands (Flanders) remained Catholic.</strong></p>
<p>Religious art was forbidden, with no patronage from the church, royal court, and nobility. Instead, a <strong>prosperous middle class of merchants</strong> commissioned art and collected it. Art was now displayed within the home. The works now needed to be small and intimate.</p>
<p>Religious subjects, mythological stories, and historical events were avoided. The Dutch retained interest in symbolism (vanitas; memento mori) and in extraordinary realism.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> 17<sup>th</sup> century Northern Baroque (Dutch) etching</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Print<br />
Male-female relationships<br />
Portrait<br />
Commemoration</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, California</p>
<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait </em></strong><strong><em>with</em></strong> <strong><em>Saskia</em></strong> is an <strong>etching</strong> by <strong>Rembrandt van Rijn</strong>, that measures <strong>4 feet by 3 feet 7 inches. </strong>Rembrandt illustrates himself using a lot of  dark, deep lines, as he is in the foreground of the work.  Saskia is composed of faint lines and less of them to indicate she is further away on the picture plane.</p>
<h5><strong>How was this Engraving Made?</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>engraving </strong>is made with a <strong>burin. </strong>An image is carved or <strong>incised</strong>, into the surface of a metal plate using a <strong>burin</strong>. This object is a tool, with a flat round top that fits into the palm of the hand. It has a has a short, sharp tip. The width and depth of the engraved line depends upon the angle it is used.</p>
<p>Once the surface is cut it is covered with ink. This pools into the incised area. The ink is then wiped away from the surface. The surface is applied to paper with pressure.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Saskia and his love for her, inspired Rembrandt to create this work. Prints were a way to make art accessible to more people, many of whom would later buy paintings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Couple Captured</strong></h5>
<p><strong>This work is a double portrait</strong> or marriage portrait of Rembrandt and his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh. This is the only etching in which the two of them appear together. They look up at the viewer, as if they were just interrupted from enjoying a moment together. Both are sitting and a table and Rembrandt has a pencil in hid hand. He has been sketching.</p>
<p>Saskia is shown as supportive and attentive to her husband. Rembrandt dominates the image and gazes directly at the viewer. Both are wearing historical clothing from the 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h5><strong>The Theme of Self Portraits</strong></h5>
<p>Self-Portraits were a  common theme for Rembrandt. He created more than 100 in the span of 40 years. He often posed his subjects in costume as a form of play acting.</p>
<p>Rembrandt met Saskia while working for her cousin, Hendrick, who was an Amsterdam art dealer. They were married and together for 13 years, until Saskia died. This etching was created after the couple’s second year of marriage.</p>
<h5><strong>Art and the Dutch Golden Age </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Trade in the Dutch Golden Age brought with it incredible wealth. It was seen as an investment. It also subtly showed the wealth of the owner.</p>

<p>Born in the Netherlands, <strong>Rembrandt van Rijn</strong> (1606-1669) was a Dutch Baroque painter and print maker. He painted light and shades, while capturing moods and realism. Much of his work is biblical, as well as historical, but he also painted portraits and self-portraits.</p>
<p>Some of his most famous works include <em>The Night Watch, The Storm of the Sea of Galilee, Bathsheba at the Bath</em>, and <em>The Return of the Prodigal Son</em>.</p>

<p>In <strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance</em></strong>, an <strong>oil on canvass</strong>, measuring <strong>1 foot 5 inches by 1 foot 3 inches, </strong>painted by <strong>Johannes Vermeer</strong>. The Northern characteristics in this work include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of iconography</li>
<li>Incredible detail</li>
<li>Small-scale works</li>
<li>Interior scenes</li>
<li>Genre scenes</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a sense of geometric and mathematical stability. The room uses 1-point perspective. Everything radiates outward from the corner of the painting behind the woman’s hand.  Her hand creates a pyramid that extends downward to the tabletop.</p>
<h5><strong>The Master of Light</strong></h5>
<p>Vermeer was known as the “master of light”. The light illuminates the front of the woman’s  body as it spread across the room.  The subtle use of color softens the light, especially blue and yellow.</p>
<h5><strong>Camera Obscura</strong></h5>
<p>The painting does not resolve clearly or come into focus until you reach the subject and her hand.  This has led historians to wonder if he was using a <strong>camera obscura</strong>. The word means “dark chamber”.</p>
<p>This was an ancestor to the photographic camera. <strong>Camera obscura </strong>took 3-D works and transformed them into 2D. It requires a viewing lens and viewing screen in a box.</p>
<p>The light has a reflective quality, with distortion. Things are not in focus. A blue tinge  was common from the glass and refraction of light. There is no historical evidence to show that Vermeer owned one, but the visual evidence seems uncanny.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of the Work</strong></h5>
<p>The painting urges us to conduct our lives with temperance and moderation lest we be judged. This is known as a <strong>vanitas, or vanity</strong> painting. It is <strong>didactic</strong> in that it warns us of moral depravity, vanity, and selfishness.</p>
<p>The theme is judging or weighing. The woman is accessing her goods, when it is her own soul that will be weighed or judged. It is actions that matter, not possessions. It urges for a relationship between wealth and spirituality, that encourages a balance between the two.</p>
<p>The Dutch were Protestant and therefore did not shun any display of wealth the way Catholics did, according to Catholic dogma.  However, many were concerned that Dutch displays of wealth were becoming too lavish. People were more concerned with worldly possessions than spirituality.</p>
<p>One term coined by art historian Simon Schama for this idea: the <strong>embarrassment of riches.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Content of the Work</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance</em></strong> is an extremely quiet <strong>genre scene. </strong>This is what Vermeer is known for. Women engaged in ordinary domestic activities, with tranquil and luminous interior scenes were frequent in his work.</p>
<p>The woman is pregnant, which is why art historians believe the model to be the artist’s wife Catherina Vermeer. The surroundings are very opulent. She is wearing exceptionally fine clothing, and a typical linen cap that women wore, while at home.</p>
<p>The woman holds in her right hand a balance with nothing on either side yet. The scale is at equilibrium. This is suggestive of her inner state of mind. She seems to be about to weigh the valuables in front of her &#8212; blue cloth, open boxes, two strands of pearls and a gold chain.</p>
<p>A mirror is across from her on the wall. <strong>Mirrors </strong>were a common type of <strong>iconography</strong> in Dutch Baroque art. They were meant to show vanity, futility, human excess, and concern for the worldly instead of the spiritual. Perhaps this is a <strong>vanitas</strong>: reminder of man’s mortality.</p>
<h5><strong>Last Judgment Painting </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Behind the woman hangs a painting of Christ, who judges over all souls. It illustrates the blessed souls at the bottom left and the damned on the right.</p>
<p>The woman’s head is in a position that it divides the two. This starts the viewer questioning. Which side will she end up on? In the moment, the woman does not seem to notice the lesson or the painting.</p>
<p>Art historians have questioned if this painting, within a painting, really exists, or if it came from Vermeer’s imagination. It this painting is real it has never been found.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background </strong></h5>
<p>At this period of time, the Dutch were now Protestant. Religious art was forbidden and there was no central church to commission it.  Instead, a prosperous middle class of merchants collected art and  commissioned it.</p>
<p>During the <strong>Dutch Golden Age of the 17<sup>th</sup> century</strong>,  trade and exploration of the New World and Southeast Asia led to Dutch dominance, especially in the <strong>spice trade</strong>. This created a tremendous wealth.</p>
<p>There was great anxiety over this wealth. It needed to be used appropriately. Art was displayed in home, so they needed small, intimate works. There was a taste for art about classical mythology, as well as still lifes, landscapes, genre scenes, and portraits.</p>
<h5><strong>About Vermeer</strong></h5>
<p>Dutch painter <strong>Johannes Vermeer</strong> (1632-1676) created 34 works in his lifetime. Like other Golden Age artists, he painted subjects about everyday life.</p>
<p>The <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> is his most iconic work. In fact, Hollywood made it into a movie! Other paintings include <em>View from Delft</em> and <em>Girl with a Red Hat</em>.</p>
<p><strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong>! <em>Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window</em> has been under restoration.  An x-ray revealed an image on the back wall behind the girl in the painting. Hidden under layers of paint, it was assumed that Vermeer had not been happy with the image and covered it.</p>
<p>Testing the paint sample, historians concluded that the paint over had occurred after the artist&#8217;s death! Therefore, the museum can to the decision to reveal the work in its full glory, as Vermeer would have wanted it to be seen.</p>
<p>There is a large cupid there, which is now visible. It seems the girl is reading a <strong>love letter</strong>!</p>

<h3><strong>Theme:  “Classicism with Passion”</strong></h3>
<p>While <strong>Baroque</strong> art introduces a new dynamic, theatrical quality to its arts, it continues – to some extent – the classicism of the Renaissance. Baroque art can be thought of as a conflict between the reason of classicism and extreme passion.</p>
<p><strong>Baroque</strong> is a term given to a style of 18<sup>th</sup> art. The word means <strong>irregularly shaped or odd</strong>. The work was criticized for its ignorance of Italian Renaissance.</p>

<h4><strong>17<sup>th</sup> Century Southern Baroque (Italian)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Historical Context (1600-1700)</strong></p>
<p>Papal power grew again because of Counter Reformation (Catholic Church’s response to Protestant Reformation)</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul V (Borghese) 1605-21</li>
<li>Urban VIII (Barberini) 1623-44</li>
<li>Innocent X (Pamphili) 1644-55</li>
<li>Alexander VII (Chigi) 1655-67</li>
</ul>
<p>MAP</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations Baroque Italian</strong></h5>
<p>Catholic Popes were patron who wanted to display their triumph over the Counter Reformation and attract new worshippers. They needed art to incite piety in the viewer and glorify religion. All artistic mediums and forms are used together to display power of Catholic Church (architecture, painting, sculpture, etc.)</p>
<p>Rome was the center of the art world until 1650, when enormously powerful French kings began to dominate patronage.</p>
<p>The emphasis in Baroque art was motion and emotion in all art forms.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> illustrated movement and energy with facades undulating in space. There were entrances with pediments or tympana and rich interiors. The buildings were often large and impressive. Construction of St. Peter’s because a symbol of the Church’s energy to combat Protestantism</p>
<p><strong>Painting </strong>employed dramatic light and dark contrast. Caravaggio began <strong>tenebrism</strong>. There was drama and sense of movement.</p>

<p><strong><em>Il Gesù</em></strong> by <strong>Giacomo da Vignola and Giacomo della Porta</strong>, stands in <strong>Rome, Italy.</strong> Numerous materials were used for construction and décor including <strong>brick, marble, stucco,</strong> and <strong>fresco</strong>.</p>
<p>An older building was first constructed. Then, between 1568-1584  the façade was added and the inside renovated. This was the first true Baroque façade, and it introduced the style into architecture as <strong>Baroque classicism. </strong>Vignola developed the overall design, while della Porta constructed the vault, dome, and apse.</p>
<p><strong><em>Il Gesù </em></strong><em>is a</em> Jesuit church. “Gesu” simply means Jesus in Italian. HIS on front in crest is Christ’s name.</p>
<h5><strong>The Façade </strong></h5>
<p>The Façade is divided into two floors. On the <strong>lower level </strong>there are six Corinthian columns. Five are pilasters, with one engaged column by the door. The <strong>entablature</strong>, or horizontal moldings supported by column, has inscriptions.</p>

<p>The visitor is immediately projected into the body of the church, that is a simple basilica plan with semi-circular nave. There are no side aisles, no radiating chapels, and no transept.  <strong>Chapels</strong> run along the side, but you cannot walk through these. Aisles were removed to allow space for traffic. This provides worshippers with a wide uncluttered space, unified under the ceiling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-903" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/82-il-gesu-floor-plan.jpg?resize=762%2C573&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="762" height="573" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/82-il-gesu-floor-plan.jpg?w=330&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/82-il-gesu-floor-plan.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The altar is the focus. The transept does not extend beyond the nave. There is a semicircular apse, with stairs that spill out.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Il Gesù </em></strong><em>was the </em>Mother church of the Jesuit order. It was constructed after the death of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of Jesuit order. The site was chosen because he once prayed here before the image of the Holy Virgin. This image is inside the church and is <strong>site-specific</strong>.</p>
<p>The patron was Cardinal Alexander Farnese, an enormously rich, powerful, art-loving cardinal. Farnese was the grandson of Pope Paul III, who had authorized the founding of the Jesuits.</p>

<h5><strong>What makes this Baroque?</strong></h5>
<p>The interior has <strong>movement, vivid color, energy</strong>, and <strong>drama</strong>. It illustrates <strong>light versus dark</strong>. Art moves into all the spaces, drawing the viewer in.</p>
<p>The dark corners have been eliminated and the sculptures have been added over time.</p>
<p>The  <strong>classicizing elements</strong> inside <strong>fluted pilasters, columns, barrel vaulted arches</strong> and a barrel-vaulted ceiling. These are all things we expect from the Renaissance, but here they are made with <strong>ochre marble and jasper stone.</strong> These colors add flair.</p>

<figure id="attachment_463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-463" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-463" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/82-Ig-Gesu-3.jpg?resize=370%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="370" height="501" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/82-Ig-Gesu-3.jpg?w=243&amp;ssl=1 243w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/82-Ig-Gesu-3.jpg?resize=222%2C300&amp;ssl=1 222w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-463" class="wp-caption-text">Triumph of the Name of Jesus<br />© The Bridgeman Art Library</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a hugely explosive <strong>fresco</strong>. This ceiling embodies drama, energy, and movement.</p>
<p>It travels from the earthly to the heavenly and physical. Then to the spiritual.</p>
<p>The light appears to have broken the ceiling open.  The figures are zooming up toward it with great speed. These are the Catholics entering heaven.  In the center of the sunburst was the name of Jesus (HIS) with a cross.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/82-Close-Up-Painting.jpg?w=990&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Figures who ignore this light are the rejected. The group are in darkened shades, being pushed out on the bottom.</p>
<p>The theme here is triumphalism. Protestantism at this point in history is over 100 years old. It is not going away, but Catholicism is true.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Terms</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Di sotto in sù</strong> means “from the bottom up”. In this ceiling painting there is  space that moves vertically as if it is hovering above the viewers vs <strong>quaddro riportato</strong> in the <strong>Sistine Chapel. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Trompe l’oeil</strong> is used in the architecture and many “stone” figures are painted.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story Behind the Church</strong></h5>
<p>Europe was suffering great losses from Protestantism and the Catholic Church believed this was a War for Souls.  Church responded with the <strong>Counter Reformation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Council of Trent </strong>met 25 times between 1545 and 1563. They outlawed <strong>simony</strong>, or the buying of church positions. The same was done to <strong>pluralism</strong> or holding more than one church office. They encouraged religious orders to promote conversion and used art to inspire the faithful.</p>
<p>It was agreed that art should be straightforward,  but not necessarily simple. The works needed to have clear messages, as well as amaze the viewer. The design of the church was simplified, so side aisles and narthexes disappeared.</p>
<p>The Church decided to use its great wealth as a sign of its success and God’s grace. Others saw this as a sign of corruption. Counter Reformation churches became more ostentatious and more expensive to build. The idea was to incite religious passion.</p>
<h5><strong>About St. Ignatius Loyola </strong></h5>
<p><strong>St. Ignatius Loyola </strong>founded the Jesuit order to put a stop to the spread of Protestantism. He  also founded colleges for religious teachings. This spread Catholicism through conversion and monastic order.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ecstasy of St. Teresa </em></strong>is a marble sculpture created by <strong>Gian Lorenzo Bernini. </strong>Made for the <strong>Cornoro Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, </strong>in<strong> Rome, Italy, </strong>the church’s exterior is based on Il Gesù.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>Baroque classicism. </strong>The characteristics include multi-media, drama, illusionistic, gilding, involvement of the viewer, peak moment of the narrative and diagonals.</p>
<p>A broken pediment opens to reveal the sculptural image. It is presented theatrically. Rays of light are in a hidden window behind pediment. Natural light is redirected. Rays of God’s light symbolically illuminate the scene. St. Teresa is of the earth wearing thick drapery. The angel is of the heavens wearing light drapery.</p>
<h5><strong>The Use of Marble </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Marble reveals texture.</li>
<li>Skin is high gloss.</li>
<li>Feathers of the angel are rougher.</li>
<li>Drapery is animated and thick.</li>
<li>Clouds are roughly cut.</li>
<li>Body writhes under heavy cloth</li>
<li>Bodies are graceful.</li>
<li>Contrast of gold/cream, rough/smooth, straight/curved.</li>
<li>Marble has a weightless quality.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Bernini was commissioned by the Cornaro family to create this work for the private family chapel. It is a symbol of the status and piety of the family. <strong><em>Ecstasy of St. Teresa </em></strong>honors Teresa of Avila, and by extension, God.</p>
<p>The goal of Baroque is to involve the viewer and inspire faith in the miraculous. Scenes of the divine and humans interacting were extremely popular.</p>

<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE 2 (Ecstasy of St. Teresa)</strong></h5>
<p>Bernini’s sculptural interpretation uses Saint Teresa’s diary, in which she tells of her visions of God.  It involved an angel descending with a golden spear and plunging it into her. The artist uses an arrow instead.</p>
<figure id="attachment_468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-468" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-468" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/89.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa.jpg?resize=500%2C770&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="770" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/89.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa.jpg?w=213&amp;ssl=1 213w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/89.-Ecstasy-of-Saint-Teresa.jpg?resize=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1 195w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-468" class="wp-caption-text">Ecstasy of Saint Teresa<br />© Nimatallah/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here is an excerpt from her diary:</p>
<p><em>“Besides me, on the left, appeared an angel in bodily form. He was not tall but short, and very beautiful; his face was so aflame that he appeared to be one of the highest ranks of angels who are all on fire. In his hands, I saw a great golden spear and at the iron tip, there appeared to be a point of fire. This he plunged into my heart several times so that it penetrated me to my entrails. When he pulled it out, I felt that he took me with it, and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God. </em></p>
<p><em>The pain was so severe that it made me utter several moans. The sweetness caused by this intense pain was so extreme that I did not possibly wish it to cease, nor was my soul content with anything but God. This was not a physical but a spiritual pain, though my body had some share in it – even a considerable share.”</em></p>
<p>The way she wrote it makes the spiritual and physical sound the same.</p>
<p>Bernini selects the most dramatic moment of the story. Not before the angel plunges the arrow into her, nor afterwards. Her pose suggests physical exhaustion, collapse but also ecstasy and pleasure. Notice how the arrow is plunged into her public area.</p>
<p>She craved God, which in Bernini’s image, means she craves penetration. Sexual symbolism to represent a spiritual experience. He uses human experience as a symbol of a vision of God to make it relatable.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>Santa Maria della Vittoria was originally dedicated to St. Paul, but was rededicated to Virgin Mary, in gratitude for a military victory, in Bohemia, in 1620.  The head of Cornaro family, Federico Cornaro, was cardinal in Venice, with important ties to Rome.</p>
<p>Cornaros were patrons of Barefoot Carmelites, the order of nuns that Teresa belonged to. She had no chapel dedicated to her yet,  despite being a prominent nun.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of Teresa Avila </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Teresa of Avila</strong> (1515-1582) was a Spanish nun of the Barefoot Carmelites. She had recently been canonized or made a saint in 1622.</p>
<p>She lived in a Carmelite convent. While there, she  wrote her accounts of viewing angels down. She also recorded her experience with levitations. Her diary was a best seller in 17<sup>th</sup> century Rome.</p>
<h5><strong>Direct Contact with God </strong></h5>
<p>The Catholic Reformation was all about pomp, extravagance, and drama, to grab the faithful and inspire piety in them. They were criticized by the Protestants, saying that Catholicism does not give the follower direct contact with God.</p>
<p>Catholics began to promote stories that showed Catholics having these direct connections with the divine.</p>

<p><strong>Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680)</strong> was a sculptor, architect, painter, playwright, and stage designer, during the Baroque era.  His father, Pietro, trained him, with an influence toward Mannerist sculpture, as well as Hellenistic works.</p>
<p>The younger Bernini was employed on huge projects in Rome, while also in demand across Europe. He was even invited to France by King Louis XIV.</p>

<p><strong><em>San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane</em></strong>, is a <strong>stone and stucco</strong> church in <strong>Rome, Italy</strong>, designed by architect <strong>Francesco Borromini</strong>. This example of Baroque classicism sits on an unusually small, oddly shaped location.</p>
<p>The building creates a sense of movement, with alternating convex and concave patterns and undulating surfaces. This gives a sense of push and pull. The façade is higher than the rest of the building.</p>

<p><strong>Borromini based his interior on the theory that science, mathematics and nature are inseparable.</strong> This is how God created harmony in the world.</p>
<p>The floor plan is based on two triangles , that share one side. These form a diamond. A circle fits inside each triangle. The circles together form an oval.</p>
<p>The oval-shape is repeated in the dome overhead and a <strong>lantern</strong> lets light on.  The dome is lightened with <strong>coffers</strong> that are hexagon and octagon shaped.  There is a sophistication of repeating geometric shapes. Triangles are represented throughout the church.</p>
<p>The eye is drawn in by great white columns. The interior side chapels merge into central space.  The walls are treated as sculptural elements that bulge and curve. Decorative natural elements include carved <strong>rosettes</strong>.</p>

<p>Borromini did not use color like Bernini. Keeping the church white, means drama and beauty come from the intricacy of the stone cutting and the curving of the stone. Borromini was a stone cutter and cut many of these stones himself.</p>

<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>Borromini was commissioned by a group called the Trinitarians, who promoted the devotion to the Trinity. Since the group did not have a lot of money, the architect offered to do the commission for free if he had full creative rights.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Story </strong></h5>
<p>The name of this Catholic Church means Saint Charles of the Four Fountains. The square in Rome it was built on contains four fountains. It is known as a <strong>church based on perfect geometry. </strong></p>
<p>To counter Reformation, art was intended to awe the viewer and depict the harmony of God.  Borromini achieves this through mathematical perfection.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>About the Architect </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Francesco Borromini (1599-1667)</strong> was an architect who helped to define Baroque style in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. This new style was a reaction to the 16<sup>th</sup> century of Renaissance, which represented linear form in a very structured geometric way. Borromini took these geometric forms oval, squares and rectangles and choose to overlap the shapes. He also took classical elements from Greek and Roman architecture and molded them into new forms.</p>
<p>Borromini was eccentric, brooding, quiet, and famous. He was a contemporary and rival to  Gian Lorenzo Bernini and never was quite as well known.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew</em></strong> by Italian painter <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, is an <strong>oil on canvas work</strong> measuring <strong>10 feet 5 inches by 10 feet five inches. </strong>It hangs in the<strong> Contarelli Chapel, </strong>at <strong>San Luigi dei Francescei, </strong>in<strong> Rome, Italy.</strong></p>
<p>In this painting the light comes in from the right for illumination. There is also a window overhead in Contarelli Chapel which streams in natural light.</p>
<h5><strong>Techniques and Style</strong></h5>
<p>Here Caravaggio uses <strong>tenebrism</strong> or “dark manner” There is extreme <strong>chiaroscuro</strong> or an effect of light and dark shadows. The images shift from dark to light very quickly without any shades in the middle.</p>
<p>The painting has the <strong>Baroque characteristics of drama</strong>. The figures sit or stand on a narrow stage and the action happens close to the viewer. Caravaggio maintain the high naturalism of the High Renaissance but adds drama and intensity.</p>
<p>He also employs <strong>radical naturalism, </strong>using everyday characters. These are earth bound common figures. Even Christ looks like a regular guy. He is barely elevated above his followers and there is only the fainted hint of a halo. Christ in this painting is far from the idealized beauty of the High Renaissance.</p>
<h5><strong>A Dedication to Saint Mathew</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew </em></strong>is one of three paintings, by Caravaggio, hanging in the Contarelli Chapel, that are dedicated to the saint. Mathew was one of Christ’s disciples.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew</em></strong>, hangs on the left, <em>Inspiration of St. Matthew</em>, is in the center , and Martyrdom of St. Matthew hangs on the right.</p>
<p>The Chapel belonging to the French Cardinal Matthieu Cointerel chose him namesake Matthew as the subject of the chapel’s decorative program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew</em></strong> shows the moment of transition or spiritual awakening in Matthew. The work was intended to show the faith and piety of the believers and to inspire the non-believers.</p>
<h5>The Story Within the Painting</h5>
<p>The story is from the New Testament.  Matthew is a tax collector who sits with other tax collectors, in a Roman pub. The foppishly dressed men lean forward to greedily count their money.</p>
<p>The light in the painting symbolizes Christ and it enters with him  He delicately and gracefully extends his arm outwards to Matthew. <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew </em></strong>is Reminiscent of the hand of Adam in Sistine Chapel. This was intentional as Caravaggio was a big fan of Michelangelo.</p>
<p>Christ points to Matthew and asks him to follow. Matthew is in disbelief and points to himself to clarify what Christ has just asked. This is one moment in time at the climax of the story.</p>

<p>Three hands (Trinity) point towards Matthew. The light cast on Matthew is the light of conversion.</p>
<p>St. Peter is the heavy, powerful, burly man turned into the picture plane, who blocks Christ from being fully seen by the viewer.</p>
<h5><strong>The History of Art and Church</strong></h5>
<p>During Counter-Reformation, the church wanted to use art to emphasize that a personal connection to God was possible. This helped to make Catholicism real and accessible.</p>
<p>To pull the viewer into the art it used moments of transformation. Think Bernini’s approach for <em>Ecstasy of St. Teresa. </em></p>
<h5><strong>A Unique Approach </strong></h5>
<p>While Bernini used a saint in his work Caravaggio, chose art for the masses, by bringing the masses into his art. For the first time, a sacred Biblical episode was depicted as a normal realistic event in the same timeframe it was painted in.</p>
<h5><strong>About Caravaggio </strong></h5>
<p>Artist <strong>Caravaggio (1571-1610)</strong> was born in Milan, Italy. He was considered the father of modern painting at the time. When the bubonic plague killed his family, while he was a child, he apprenticed with Simone Peterzano, in Milan. He was just 11 years old. Afterwards, he moved to Rome where his technique in tenebrism proved popular.</p>
<p>The commission for <strong>Contarelli Chapel </strong>gave his work exposure and more work would follow.</p>
<p><strong>Caravaggio</strong> led a troubled life with drinking gambling and fighting throughout.</p>
<h4><strong>17<sup>th</sup> Century Southern Baroque (Spanish)</strong></h4>
<p>Beginning in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, Spain&#8217;s status as an international power was in decline. There was a rapid inflation, declining political power in New World, loss of colonies, and a weakening of Hapsburgs</p>
<p>Spain allied with HRE and Catholic Church to attempt to retain power.</p>
<p>Hapsburg monarchs remained avid art patrons.  They were deeply Catholic, and this contributed to the representation of Catholic dogma.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish Baroque artists</strong> produced art that moved viewers towards greater devotion and piety.</p>

<p>This work entitled, <strong>Las Meninas</strong>, is <strong>10 feet and 5 inches by 9 feet by 1 inch oil on canvas </strong>painting by<strong> Diego Velázquez. </strong>Here we find a new technique called <strong>impasto. </strong>This method uses a thick and very visible application of paint, using brushstrokes described as <strong>gestural. </strong>The effect is very painterly.</p>
<p>The <strong>contrast between light and dar</strong>k is shown here in a technique known as <strong>tenebrism</strong>. It was popularized by Caravaggio. Tenebrism is derived from the Italian word &#8216;tenebroso&#8217; which means darkened and obscuring. Certain parts of paintings, such as faces, and hands are illuminated by highlights which are contrasted by a mainly dark setting.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>This is a <strong>group portrait</strong> of the artist in his studio at work. This <strong>genre scene</strong> is highly informal. It uses both normal poses and intimate glances to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>Velázquez paints himself stepping back from his canvas to look straight at the viewer. He wears the cross of the Royal Order of Santiago, elevating him to knighthood.  This illustrates his status both as an artist and in the community.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Infanta Margarita of Spain, is with her <strong>meninas, </strong>or maids and attendants<strong>.</strong> The infanta has just noticed the viewer, while one maid begins to curtsy.</p>
<p>In the painting there is also a dwarf, which were fashionable to have by royalty, along with a dog. In the middle is a nurse or bodyguard. While in the background is Jose Nieto, the head of the queen’s tapestries.</p>
<p><strong>King Philip IV and his Queen appear in the mirror.</strong> The viewer know it is a mirror because it is reflective. The canvases and tapestries hanging around the room do not reflect light. Look closely. The angle of the canvas and the angle of the mirror do not match up.</p>

<p>The king was the last great Spanish Hapsburg king.  Spain’s status as an international power was in decline with inflation, downward political power, and a loss of colonies.</p>
<p>An alliance was created with the Catholic Church in attempt to retain power.  Spain was deeply Catholic since the Catholic fanaticism from Isabella and Ferdinand. Art from this time is almost always religious in nature or portraiture.</p>
<h5>About the Artist</h5>
<p><strong>Diego Velázquez (1599-1660)</strong> was born in Seville, Spain. Showing early artistic talents, he was already apprenticed, by the age of 11, to Francisco Pacheco, the city’s most significant artist and art theorist. There he learned drawing, painting, still life and portraiture.</p>
<p><strong>Velázquez was greatly influenced by Caravaggio.</strong></p>
<p>Once he finished his apprenticeship, in 1617, he married Pacheco’s daughter, and set up his own studio.</p>
<p>In 1623, <strong>Velázquez</strong> was asked to paint a portrait of the young King Philip IV. Soon after, he was appointed one of the court painters, enabling him to move his family to Madrid.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, he became remarkably close to the royal family, taking on greater responsibility within the household. By 1658, he was <strong>honored by being knighted.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>New Spanish Baroque</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>New Spanish Baroque</strong> refers to Baroque <strong>art in the Viceroyalty of New Spain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Baroque styles were imported by peninsulares and adopted by creoles living in the New World</li>
<li>Often, indigenous practices were mixed with European trends</li>

<p><strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe</em></strong>, created by <strong>Miguel González</strong>, is an artwork made from <strong>oil on canvas. placed on wood, inlaid with mother-of-pearl,</strong> and measuring<strong> 39 by 27 inches.</strong></p>
<p>This is an example of Baroque work during the time, with its extravagant and decorative design. The inspiration for the work was Japanese<strong> lacquerware</strong> part of Asian decorative arts that was extremely popular. This work uses a Mexican technique created to approximate that look called <strong>enconchado</strong>. Concha means shell in Spanish.</p>
<h5><strong>The Art of Enconchado</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Miguel González is considered one of the best artists in <strong>enconchado. </strong>This consisted of placing tiny fragments of mother-of-pearl onto a canvas that sat on top of wood.  Then the shells were covered with a yellowish tint and thin glazes of paint. This created a luminescence that could not be replicated by paint.</p>
<p>Enconchado paintings often have highly elaborate frames. <strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe</em></strong> is shell inlaid with lavish floral motifs.</p>
<h5><strong>Popularity of Virgin of Guadalupe</strong></h5>
<p>Veneration of Virgin of Guadalupe increased because people attributed her with miracles and interceding on their behalf during times of turmoil.</p>
<p>This work was created for individual worship and to display the owner’s piety. It also illustrated social status and wealth as <strong>enconchado </strong>technique was expensive, new, and trendy.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the Work</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>center</strong> depicts the Virgin of Guadalupe. She averts her gaze and clasps her hands together in piety. Standing on a crescent moon supported by a <strong>seraph</strong>, or holy winged being, she wears the traditional clothes of Mary. This consists of a long blue cloak with hood.  Roses decorate her dress and golden stars adorn her cloak.</p>
<p>A mandorla of light surrounds her. Rays frame her head in reference to her crown of stars.</p>
<p>In the <strong>roundels</strong>, the top left, top right, and bottom left scene apparitions. Each roundel is supported by an angelic figure.  In the <strong>bottom right</strong> Juan Diego unveils her image on tunic to the Bishop.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Trade and Art</strong></h5>
<p>The Spanish Philippines traded with Japan.  Japanese goods arrived in Mexico, via Spanish ships enroute to Europe.  When Japan became isolationist in the 17<sup>th</sup> century Japanese goods stopped arriving. This led to a high demand for Mexican artists to create some of their own Asian-inspired objects.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of the Virgin of Guadalupe</strong></h5>
<p>The story of the <strong>Virgin of Guadalupe</strong> varies from region to region, but the basics remain the same. In December 1531, a man named Juan Diego was on his way to mass. He walked on the Tepeyac hill, formerly a site of a shrine to an Aztec mother goddess. Here, the Virgin appeared to him as an apparition. She asked Juan Diego to tell the Bishop of Guadalupe to construct a shrine in her honor on the hill.</p>
<p>Juan Diego asked the Bishop.  He did not believe Juan Diego and requested proof.</p>
<p>Juan Diego returned to the site and saw her a second and third time. Finally, on the fourth meeting she told Juan Diego to take roses growing on the hillside and to the Bishop.</p>
<p>When Juan Diego opened his cloak, the roses spilled out in front of the Bishop. The flowers were miraculously imprinted with the image of the Virgin.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Bishop began construction on the hill!</p>
<h5><strong>The Tunic</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Virgin of Guadalupe’s</strong> tunic was kept by the church here as a relic.  Her image was made by an unknown artist. This image became the standard representation the Virgin of Guadalupe.</p>
<h5><strong>Miguel González</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The artist, born in 1664 was considered the Michelangelo of Mexico. He painted casta paintings. portraits, large scale works, small devotional paintings and religious alter pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> <strong>Museo Nacional de Arte</strong> in La Paz, Bolivia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Angel with Arquebus Asiel Timor Dei</em></strong>, an <strong>oil on canvass</strong> work, <strong>with gilding</strong>, measuring <strong>5 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches</strong> was painted by Master of Calamarca (La Paz School). It may have been created by Jose de la Rios.</p>
<p>Established artists were unable to leave Europe and their wealthy patrons to move to the Americas. <strong>La Paz School</strong> workshop was known for crafting works of well-dressed of angels carrying guns. This combined the celestial, aristocratic and military all at once!</p>
<h5><strong>Baroque Meets Mannerism</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Angel with Arquebus, Asiel Timor Dei </em></strong>has graceful figures and a decorative and extravagant design just like Baroque. Yet, the elongation and extended lines of angel’s body recalls the Mannerist style, still preferred in the 17<sup>th</sup> century Americas.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work would have been part of a larger series of various angels.  The audience was native, mostly Inca and indigenous tribes, of Catholic, Protestant, or indigenous religions.</p>
<p>An armed angel represented the idea of divine protection over faithful Christians and the need for Catholics to defend their faith. It represented both Catholic and Spanish power over indigenous peoples. This was meant to take the place of native deities and promote Catholicism within the New World.</p>
<h5><strong>Understanding this Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Asiel indicates the name of the angel, and a quality of “Fears God”. The androgynous angel is stunningly attired. The pose is based off a series of Dutch engravings of military positions and guns.</p>
<p>The clothing combines contemporary European aristocratic fashion with Inca nobility fashion.  The broad-brimmed hat, billowing sleeves and tights are European.  The ornate clothing and feathered hat were Inca. Feathers were a sign of gods.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>A<strong> harquebus</strong> is a firearm with a long barrel, created by the Spanish in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. This gun, that rested on the shoulder, was considered the height of firearm technology.  Firearms did not exist in Americas prior to colonization, so natives associated them with the supernatural.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Background Story </strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This work was painted in the Spanish colony of Peru.  Images like these were widespread and popular throughout the Andes and used to promote the Christianization of indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>There were not many Protestants in the New World. This allowed Catholics to increase their numbers.</p>
<p>The Christian missionary orders persistently sought to end indigenous practices and promote Catholicism. Catholic Reformation promoted a militaristic ideology that portrayed the Church as an army and its followers as soldiers. Violence was justified in defense of the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>Council of Trent had only allowed depictions of angels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael for clarity of message. In the New World this was ignored.</p>

<strong>Museums:</strong> Brooklyn Museum and Museo Nacional del Virreinato &#8211; INAH, Tepotzotlán ( The screen has been divided in half and is in two separate locations)</p>
<p>This decorative artwork is a folding screen or <strong>biombo enconchado</strong> that measures <strong>7 feet 6 inches by 9 feet. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>A biombo </strong>means folding screen in Spanish. Enconchado means <strong>shell inlay.</strong></p>
<p>The primary material is <strong>wood with tempera and resin</strong>. The screen is painted on both sides with beautiful brushstrokes and intricate figures. The work embodies Spanish, Colonial, Flemish and Dutch styles. It was crafted by the <strong>Circle of Gonzales Family </strong>of artists.</p>
<p>The artist in the New World region, which today is Mexico, was inspired by Japanese folding screens. This is a <strong>Baroque</strong> work, because of the timeframe it was created, as well as its extravagance and opulence.</p>
<h5><strong>The Two Sides of the Screen</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>One side of the screen depicts the Siege of Belgrade. The  Battle of Belgrade in 1688 was part of Great Turkish War 1683-1699. The Hapsburgs were the  Christian ruling family of Spain, and they battled Turkey and therefore Islam. So, this was a very contemporary scene.</p>

<p>On the back is a hunting scene that is used to showcase the beautiful landscape, full of dense botanicals. The hunting scene itself, was from a print made of a French tapestry, owned by the Medici family.  Hunting was a sign of status, leisure, and aristocracy.</p>

<h5><strong>How the Screen was Used</strong></h5>
<p>This decorative object was commissioned by Viceroy Jose Sarmiento of New Spain for his palace in Mexico City. It had the utilitarian function of dividing the room to make it look more intimate.</p>
<p>The screen was also a <strong>conversation piece</strong> at the height of fashion in 17<sup>th</sup> century Mexico. This would have been viewed by important visitors and their spouses, who came to visit the Viceroy. It also served to politically connect New Spain with the power and events of the Spanish Hapsburgs in Europe.</p>
<p>The landscape side of the screen had a different purpose. It would have been viewed by females having a social get together such as hot chocolate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/94.-Hunting-Scene-Close-Up.png?resize=810%2C544&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="810" height="544" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/94.-Hunting-Scene-Close-Up.png?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/94.-Hunting-Scene-Close-Up.png?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/94.-Hunting-Scene-Close-Up.png?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong></h5>
<p>Japanese goods were immensely popular in Spanish viceroyalties. These objects passed through Mexico on ships heading for Europe.</p>
<p>The Viceroy’s wife was descendent of Moctezuma II. This is an example how the Aztec and Spanish lineage combined to create a new heritage for Mexico.</p>
<h5><strong>This Artwork in Comparison</strong></h5>
<p>In multicultural societies the status symbols commissioned by the wealthy members of the society had a fundamental role in the survival and development of distinct traditions. Both the <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene</em></strong> are rare and stunning works of art. Not only that they are incredibly expensive to begin with, but they reflect in a decorative way the education and intellectual curiosity of the patron and artists, who were familiar with many different artistic elements across religious and geographic barriers.</p>
<p>The 14th century <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong> was a traditional Jewish book telling the Passover story for the holiday. It was meant for a private ceremonial use. This made it easier for the patrons to cross religious boundaries and employ artists who will use as inspiration the illuminated Christian prayer manuscripts such as the Psalters and Books of Hours. The injunction of the second commandment restricted the use of figures in the Hebrew manuscripts commissioned for synagogal use.</p>
<figure id="attachment_445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-445" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-445" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?resize=500%2C660&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="660" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?resize=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1 227w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-445" class="wp-caption-text">Lamentation<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>Haggadahs were often illuminated using calligraphy, and decorative elements that organized the text: golden cartouches, full pages reserved for the tapestries at the head and end of the book. However, in the multicultural Moorish Spain, the illuminator profession became accessible to Jewish artisans, marking the beginning of figurative illuminated Hebrew manuscripts which would only be interrupted by the Expulsion to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Produced in 1320 in Barcelona and abundantly illustrated, the <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong> is one of the oldest rituals of the fourteenth century. The <strong>Spanish Jewish painting</strong> is marked by <strong>Moorish heritage</strong> and is also influenced by the very fashionable <strong>French and Italian styles</strong>. Its name comes from the golden backgrounds on which stand out the magnificent miniatures that adorn the opening pages of the manuscript. It is a masterpiece of illumination.</p>
<p>The manuscript comes from a Catalan workshop where French influence was predominant in the first quarter of the 14th century. Its iconography, in Gothic style, consists of fourteen miniatures grouped at the head of the manuscript. The biblical scenes are arranged in four compartments per page, those relating to the ritual adorn the text. The miniatures depict episodes from Genesis and the Exodus; the first scene being that of Adam naming the animals, the last, that of Myriam&#8217;s song after the passage of the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Next come scenes on the preparations for the Passover, where Miriam (Moses’ sister) and her maidens dance and play musical instruments with Islamic motifs on them. The reading direction of the paintings is that of Hebrew writing, from right to left.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Mestizo culture of the New Spain openly encouraged the blend of the native and European cultures. The viceroy chose to celebrate the Habsburg power of the Spanish ruling dynasty and overlook the differences between the rich Mexica and rich Spaniards as his own wife was a descendant of the Monctezuma.  <strong><em>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene</em></strong> reflects the cultural merging of the <strong>New, Old European, and Asian worlds</strong> and emphasize the New Spain’s strategic location at the center of Spanish trade from the east (Spain) and the west (Philippines). This screen is the only known artwork <strong>combining the biombo</strong> (Japanese inspired folding screen) and <strong>the enconchado</strong> (the Native shell inlay). Inspired by Japanese folding screens and lacquer boxes the screen exhibits on top/bottom decorative edges shining black margins with a rich floral motif embellished with gold and mother-of-pearl. The war and hunting scenes painted are of European inspiration. The inclusion of shell inlay in the composition of the war scenes creates motion as the sun on the shelf makes the soldier helmets shine.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Classical Roman-Greek decorative garland is probably not volunteer just as it was in the Dutch printmaking. It was probably the lack of training of New World’s artists in figurative painting that made the prints necessary in the first place. War and hunting scenes had nothing inherently religious and thus crossing the Protestant, Catholic barriers. Fulfilling distinct utilitarian needs, the haggadah and the screen became a medium for free aesthetic aspirations safeguarding and radically transforming cherished artistic techniques of two or more cultures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Elite Learning in Byzantium</h2>
<blockquote><p>The Early Byzantium exudes a Christian-Hellenistic duality. The mythologically decorated silverware of Byzantium sets a trap for us, the one of the pagan subject – only to force us to later acknowledge that the nymphs and satyrs were replaced in by revelers of a prosperous proto-Christian world in which the Byzantine elites banqueted and triumphed like the Greek and Roman gods themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling classes of Byzantium were defined by paideia-learning. The young Byzantines learned science in the pagan Hellenistic way based on nature, on things, on the universe, which allowed them to &#8220;situate themselves&#8221; in the world. They also learned using Graeco-Roman and Christian texts. These &#8220;classical&#8221; texts not only that offered support for their thought, but also carried a long tradition, and eventually integrated the elite children in a culture shared both with their ancestors and with their contemporaries.</p>

<p>While Christianity prevailed in the Byzantine empire, the Hellenistic influence was also strong to the point of transcending regimes, ideologies and political upheavals. Excerpted and annotated the Graeco-Roman texts were used to erect the solid foundation of that constituted the unique Byzantine culture. The thread of this classical tradition is perceptible in the <strong>Byzantine collection of silverware sets of the Dumbarton Oaks Museum</strong>.</p>
<p>Brief reminders of the classical texts and their historical development allowed art historians to decode the meaning and role of the mythologically inspired silverware, such as the<strong> <em>Bowl with a Dionysiac Procession.</em></strong> The mythological aesthetics of <strong>early Byzantine silver-works</strong> are rarely ritualistic, reflecting instead the Byzantine elites’ sophistication and their cultural attachment to the myths and texts defining the Graeco-Roman social values system.<sup>1</sup>This 5th century AC silver bowl adopted neutral revelry motifs, voluntarily reducing the distance between a recently Christianized society and classical Greek culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Tertullian&#8217;s Apology for the Christians </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;&#8230; now I see the enormous entertainments, with new names from their extravagance ; &#8230;; and I see mines of silver melted into dishes, &#8230; I see also theatres in abundance, and all indulgingly covered over.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going back in the history of teaching in the West, we encounter Greek children learning the Homeric poems by heart and then preparing themselves, by rhetorical training, for the eloquence of the tribune. In various forms, the learning of the ancient Greece stayed with us, while being extended to new conceptions of the world, whether linked to Christianity, such as scholasticism, or characteristics of the modern world, such as scientific thought.</p>
<p>In modern times, the stakes of teaching the &#8220;Classics&#8221; have continued to shift, but throughout the history of pedagogy in the early Byzantium, the classical texts had an overwhelming position. Mirroring the teachings they received, the elites of the Byzantine empire surrounded themselves with household items underlining the conflicts between their proto-Christian life and their mostly pagan education.</p>
<p>The bishops&#8217; homilies continuously spoke against the duality magic for more than seven centuries until the Council in Trullo (691-692AC), gaining ground slowly but steadily.<sup>2</sup> At a first glance <strong>the Dyonisian engravings</strong> on the Dumbarton Oaks silver bowl seem to support the the thesis of a ritual use. Yet, numerous elements support the bowl’s ornamental value.</p>
<p>The <strong>imagery honored the Dionysian festivals</strong>, traditionally associated with the immutable spring revival and a trade facilitating change in the Mediterranean winds. Presumably, the spring’s increased food stability encouraged the Byzantines to overlook the patristic fathers’ vehement condemnation of banquets.<sup>3</sup>, and maintain the Greek festivals’ social traditions of food distribution accompanied by music, dance and theatrical performances.<sup>4,5</sup></p>
<p>Technically, the <strong>repoussé and chasing</strong> require thin walls, creating fragile objects. Indeed, the bowl’s lower register is damaged, preserving only few fragments of panthers and leaves. Lacking a double wall, the bowl presumably held grapes, and enhanced the owner’s financial security.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Given the <strong>gold coinage</strong> stability during the early Byzantine Empire, the elites also acquired <strong>silver objects</strong> to display, or to melt if needed.<sup>7,8</sup></p>
<p>The well-crafted main <strong>register showcases Dionysos’ biography</strong> from his youth to his marriage, and his old age spent in the arms of Ariadne, his wife. The theme of Dionysos’ spiritual evolution betrays a Christian influence.<sup>9</sup> The Dionysian procession is altered; gone are the Hellenistic satyrs, masks, flutes, and tambourines.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The <strong>female figures</strong> are depicted dancing, reclining partially nude, and serving wine. Horse-pulled chariots and panthers bring in the <strong>partygoers.</strong> Undeniably, the decoration visually integrates the mythological Dionysian theme with the Byzantine festivities, replacing the <strong>nymphs, and ecstatic maenads</strong> with banquet or triumph revelers.</p>
<p>The association of <strong>dance</strong> with intimacy reinforces the Christian prejudice against non-gendered spaces and stigmatizes artists as sexually available.<sup>13</sup> The tension between Hellenistic and self-controlled Christian ideals also emerges in the stumbling Hercules and the dancing man holding grapes.<sup>14</sup> Resembling a drunk Silenus, the young dancer advances towards Dionysus. His torso twisted in a feminine Salome-like pose suggests an erotic play.</p>

<p>Metaphorically, the bowl exposes the banquets’ ability to efface the emerging Christian conventions and blur the gender boundaries. The profane reality of the Byzantine life, whose abundant manifestations could not easily disappear thwarted for centuries the imperial Christianization plans ultimately spawning a Christian society deeply rooted in the classical culture.</p>

<p>This section explores 16<sup>th</sup> century art including both from the southern and northern regions.</p>
<p>Let’s begin in the South…</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>16<sup>th</sup> Century Southern Art</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Human and Divine”</strong></h3>
<p>Human interest in the natural world, the human body, and the capacities of the individual, mixed with a religious Italian peninsula to create 16<sup>th</sup>-century art. This was in opposition to the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1495-1527)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pope Julius II was a major patron, leading to some of the greatest artistic creations in history</li>
<li>Rome was sacked in 1527 by troops of HRE Charles V and dramatically halted artistic achievements of the century à <strong>Mannerism</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Mannerism<br />
1520 -1600</strong></h5>
<p>Mannerism began in <strong>Florence and Rome</strong> and was seen as an artistic expression of unsettled political and religious conditions in Europe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Luther’s 95 Theses, 1517</li>
<li>Raphael’s death, 1520</li>
<li>Sack of Rome, 1527</li>
</ul>
<p>Patrons included Cosimo I (Medici) of Florence and Francis I of France. The art was elegant, intriguing. and created for sophisticated courtiers.</p>
<p><strong>Mannerism</strong> took on a departure from the balanced, harmonious, stable composition of the Renaissance. Instead, <strong>Mannerism </strong>was: <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mannerism</strong> took on a departure from the balanced, harmonious, stable composition of the Renaissance. Instead, <strong>Mannerism </strong>was: <strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Elegant, elongated, and distorted.</li>
<li>Not ideal, humanistic, or rational</li>
<li>Convoluted, complex, vague, confusing, unstable.</li>
<li>Cluttered, jumbled.</li>
<li>Figures are arranged along a vertical axis.</li>
<li>Not in a recognizable earthly setting</li>
<li>No linear perspective used.</li>
<li>No pyramidal composition but movement in all directions.</li>
<li>Voids in the middle of paintings.</li>
<li>Bright and garish colour palettes</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Figures in Mannerism </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Figures are stylized, elongated, thin, distorted.</li>
<li>Positions are not natural.</li>
<li>Bodies do not bear weight correctly.</li>
<li><strong>figura serpentinata</strong> or a twist in the figure</li>
<li>Heads are uniformly small.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mannerism</strong> was a response to the chaos and frustration of the historical events by rejecting perfection in art. Once Mannerism emerged, the word was considered a derogatory term, meaning artists could only paint in a “manner” not in a style. Later, however these works were created for sophisticated courtiers and royalty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>A desire to emulate Roman glory</li>
<li>Artists were required to belong to guilds, but began to achieve great fame as individuals</li>
<li>Patrons: popes, and princes
<ul>
<li>Women became patrons too such as Isabella d’Este.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>During this time, canvass was used instead of wood.</p>
<p><strong>Sfumato</strong> where forms are rendered subtly with a misty or smoky effect and <strong>chiaroscuro </strong>the use of strong contrasts between light and dark, typically for modeling were popular.</p>
<p>Glazes were used to build up rich oil paintings.</p>
<p>In portraits, the <strong>¾ turn</strong> was used to express character.  <strong>Compositions were balanced (∆)</strong>, symmetrical, and ideally proportioned.</p>

Mona Lisa. 1503-5. Oil on wood.</figcaption></figure>
<h5><strong>Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>Sculptures were based on classical prototypes. The medium of choice was marble, and it was left unpainted. Bronze was still used. Little negative space was left. There was heroic nudity.</p>

<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Roman treatise by Vitruvius influenced architects. Perfect proportions and symmetry were important, and the circle was viewed as the perfect shape.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> 16<sup>th</sup> century. Southern buon fresco</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy<br />
Status<br />
Power</p>
<p><strong><em>School of Athens</em></strong>, a <strong>buon fresco</strong> in <strong>Stanza della Segnatura, Vatican Palace, Vatican City, Italy, </strong>that measures<strong> 16 by 25 feet </strong>is a work by artist <strong>Raphael.</strong></p>
<p>An open, clear light is uniformly spread throughout the balanced composition. The figures are grounded, have shadows, and are evenly distributed. The use of <strong>chiaroscuro</strong> shows three-dimensionality.</p>
<p>The architecture is an idealized recreation of a classical gymnasium, inspired by Roman bathhouses. There are coffered barrel vaults and Greek meander patterns along edges. Roman sculptures include  Apollo on left, and Athena on right, along with pilasters.</p>
<p><strong><em>School of Athens </em></strong>combines <strong>one-point perspective </strong>and <strong>two-point perspective.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One-point perspective: vanishing point is right behind Plato and Aristotle</li>
<li>Two-point perspective visible in Michelangelo’s block with an angle that means new perspective must be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-695" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/76-Perspective.jpg?resize=786%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="786" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/76-Perspective.jpg?w=786&amp;ssl=1 786w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/76-Perspective.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/76-Perspective.jpg?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Creating a Buon Fresco Outline </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>cartoon</strong> for image that is small scale and perfect it</li>
<li>Make large <strong>cartoon</strong>, perforated by small holes where lines are drawn</li>
<li>Position cartoon on wall</li>
<li>Use Powder charcoal to image to accentuate the holes, leaving an outline on the wall</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Deep Thinking in the Library</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>School of Athens </em></strong> was commissioned by Pope Julius II to decorate his philosophy wall, in the library, in the Papal Apartments. Each wall had bookshelves below it that related to the four branches of human knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Theology</li>
<li>Poetry</li>
<li>Law/literature</li>
<li>Humanist thought is joined with Church teachings.</li>
</ul>
<p>This work embodies the spirit of the Renaissance when there was religious admiration for these great thinkers.  The viewer must understand each figure through color, movement, position, and dress as there are no names on the work to show identity. This has confused some historians!</p>
<h5><strong>What is School of Athens About?</strong></h5>

<p>The <strong>left side </strong>of the work contains philosophers who addressed  liberal arts, the intangible, the ideal and theoretical. <strong>Plato</strong> has been painted to look like artist Leonardo!</p>

<p>Plato holds one of his books and points upward to show that the higher reality is eternal and unchanging. He argued that appearances are not the final truth. He wears red (fire) and purple (air) and neither of these have weight. <strong>Socrates</strong>, Plato’s teacher, is in dark green.</p>

<p><strong>Pythagoras</strong> sits on the bottom left, in pink, and is holding a book.</p>

<p><strong>Heraclitus</strong> leans on a block, appearing deep in thoughts about his interests in cosmology. The figure is based on Michelangelo. Raphael added him in later by using some fresh plaster.</p>
<p>On the right side are the great thinkers of math and science, the tangible, practical and empirical. This is symbolized by <strong>Aristotle</strong>, Plato’s student.  Aristotle holds his book <em>Ethics</em>, which focuses on the observable. He is grounded and his clothing reflects this with the brown of the earth and the blue of the water.  <strong>Diogenes</strong>, the founder of Cynic philosophy lays on the stairs.</p>

<h5><strong>The Greater Story</strong></h5>
<p>At this point in history, the artist is seen as more than just a craftsman. Popes are now directly commissioning art. The Church had traditionally turned away from classical antiquity. Now, under Pope Julius II, it is embraced. Religions and secularism are joined.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>About Raphael</strong></h5>
<p>Italian Renaissance painter <strong>Raphael (1483- 1520)</strong> was born in Urbino, Italy. His father was a painter for Duke of Urbino, so he was taught skills early. He died when Raphael was just 11 and the boy was forced to take over his father’s workshop. Soon, Raphael was known as the best painter in his town.</p>
<p>In 1500, Raphael was invited to apprentice in Perugia, Central Italy, with master painter Pietro Vannunci. After four years, Raphael left to move to Florence, where he was inspired by the great artists of the time. Raphael would be best known for his work in painting Madonnas and frescos.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sistine Chapel</strong>, in <strong>Vatican City, Italy</strong>, is a simple basilica, with barrel vault, in classical revival style. It measures <strong>133 feet by 46 feet. </strong>What makes it extraordinary is that every surface of space is decorated. There are <strong>300 figures on the ceiling</strong>, each one is unique and no two are in the same pose.</p>

<p><strong>Michelangelo </strong>was first and foremost a sculptor, but  he  had started learning to paint.</p>
<h5><strong>Creating the Ceiling Art</strong></h5>
<p>The artist used a series of complex scaffolding to stand on and paint the ceiling. Before he started to paint, the curved ceiling was a flat blue color, with some decorative stars.</p>
<p>Michelangelo painted the figures first in <strong>grisailles</strong>, or grays, to get modeling and shadow correct. Then, color was painted over top.</p>
<p>Some of the other techniques the artist used include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trompe l’oeil</strong> architecture: French for “tricking the eye” with anything that is illusionistic.</li>
<li><strong>Quaddro Riportato</strong>: “carried picture” that allows a fresco to be seen straight on, in a space parallel to the floor.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Why was the Sistine Chapel Built?</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Sistine Chapel</strong> was built to show the power and  legitimacy of the Church and Pope, through extravagance and scope. It is also a statement of artistic genius.</p>
<p>The Pope holds mass here for important guests. This is also the place where new Popes are picked.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is it decorated with Old Testament Scenes? </strong></h5>
<p>One often wonders why the Catholic Church would choose to have Old Testament scenes created and not New Testament scenes.  In fact, there are no images of Christ on the ceiling at all!</p>
<p>Catholic Church’s claims are validated by emphasizing the prophecies foretold the events in the Old Testament.</p>
<p><strong>Sibyls</strong> and <strong>Prophets</strong> are ancient pagan soothsayers, who could see the future and foretell the coming of Christ.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Michelangelo’s Work</strong></h5>
<p>Michelangelo chose a complicated arrangement of figures for the ceiling.  The work shows the first few chapters of Genesis, with accompanying <strong>Old Testament figures and antique sibyls</strong>.</p>
<p>Michelangelo’s term for his youthful male nudes, or <strong>ignudi </strong>are completed in the artist’s own style that  expresses classicism and humanism. Yet,  they do not advance the narrative.</p>

<p>Michelangelo painted these scenes in backwards chronological order. He wanted to perfect his style before he got to the scenes with God.</p>
<p>There are nine main scenes in the narrative that begin at the alter.</p>

<p>Michelangelo took a break from painting and when he returned after 1510, he painted Delphic Sibyl. Her massive form is a basic triangle, in that she widens towards the hips. Circular forms create the scroll, knees, and cloak. While the space she sits in is rigid, her body is round.</p>
<h5><strong>Enhancing the Female Form</strong></h5>
<p>Female forms were based off the muscularity of men. Her arms are extremely powerful. Even so, she has a grace and gentleness. In the style of the day, ennobling the female forms made the figures appear stronger and greater.</p>
<p>It was considered inappropriate to sketch a female nude at the time. Male nudes were often substituted. In this case Michelangelo used cadavers to achieve the correct musculature.</p>
<h5><strong>The Delphic Sibyl </strong></h5>
<p>The word Sibyl was first mentioned by the ancient Greek writer Heraclitus in 500 BC. It was not just Old Testament figures who foretold the coming of Christ. One of the most famous Delphic Sibyls predicted the falling of Troy.</p>
<p>The position of Sibyl was filled by many different women over the years. There were no social or economic criteria for the role, but she had to be wise, in her 40s or 50s, and understand the role of the gods.  On the seventh day of every month, she sat at the Delphic temple on a big rock, with ivy growing on it. Here, she would make prophecies.</p>
<p>Her blue head scarf  acted as a crown or diadem to show her legitimacy.</p>
<h5><strong><em>Creation of Adam</em></strong></h5>

<p>This narrative has been paired down to essentials. God is in sky and Adam is bound to earth.  The figures possess a sculptural quality of both strength and grace. In fact, the depiction of Adam is influenced by the classical sculpture Belvedere Torso. Adam is heroically nude and an ideal beauty. This connects him to the divine.</p>
<p>God and angels sit on a shape like the brain. This indicates that being human is the capacity to think. Under God’s left arm is Eve waiting to be born.</p>

<p>Michelangelo created this work before 1510. This was prior to his monumental style like that Adam or Delphic Sibyl.</p>
<p>This work shows the story of Noah’s Ark. God decided people were so wicked that he needed to cleanse the earth with a flood and start over. Noah and his family are good, so God tasks them with bringing two of every animal to restart the world.</p>
<p>On the back panel, Noah works on building the ark, only it does not look like a boat.  It looks like the Sistine Chapel! This shows that salvation is the church.</p>

<p>Pope Paul III commissioned Michelangelo to do create this fresco. Pope brought the master of ceremonies in to watch Michelangelo, even though the artist insisted he did not want anyone to watch him. The master of ceremonies complained that there were too many nudes.</p>
<p>Michelangelo painted this between 1534-1541. By then, the style had changed from High Renaissance to Mannerism . This focused on distortion, with a jumbled composition, and was a reaction against High Renaissance order and harmony.</p>
<p>The work shows the Last Judgment, where Christ returns to Earth in his second coming and judges mankind. On the left,  those who have sinned are separated from the blessed, who will go to heaven, on the right.  On the lower right is Minos, with a serpent wrapped around his chest.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of the Sistine Chapel</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sistine Chapel</strong> was erected, in 1483, under Sixtus IV, hence the name. The Catholic Church was trying to maintain authority, during Protestant rumblings, corruption, and extravagance.</p>
<p>Michelangelo began to work on the frescoes for Pope Julius II in 1508. He asked the artist to paint a ceiling with geometric designs and place the 12 disciples in the spandrels. Michelangelo proposed this instead.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the <strong>Sistine Chapel</strong> had become quite filthy, with years of dust and candle soot. It was not until the ceilings were cleaned, in the last 20 years, that the work of Michelangelo was revealed. Full, vibrant colors, for a new generation to marvel at!</p>
<p>Prior to this, historians often spoke about Michelangelo as a poor colorist or that he seemed to have used drab and bland colors.</p>
<p>Almost immediately during cleaning, it became apparent that the ceiling was simply <em>that</em> dirty that it had obscured Michelangelo’s brilliant use of vibrant color.</p>

<h5><strong>About Michelangelo</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Michelangelo (1475-1564)</strong> was born in Caprese, Republic of Florence, in Italy.  He was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect, and poet and considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime.</p>
<p>He trained with painter Ghirlandaio, once his father realized his son had zero interest in school and would therefore never take over the family’s financial business. The boy would first learn the techniques of fresco and draftsmanship.</p>
<p>After one year, he moved into the palace of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the Medici clan. Here the artist studied classical sculpture with Bertoldo di Giovanni.</p>
<p>In 1446, he arrived in Rome, at the age of 21. As they say, the rest was history!</p>
<p>The artist will forever be associated with the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>Venice remained an independent power with a powerful trading fleet. The style of Venetian art included drama, dynamic, and color. In fact, Venetian painters were among the earliest to use oil painting in Italy.</p>
<p>The work is known for sensuous forms, and the celebrated beauty of natural world (Arcadian).</p>
<p>Canvases were used because of the humidity.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Uffizi in Florence</p>
<p>This is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> painting by <strong>Titian</strong> entitled <em>Venus of Urbino</em>, measuring <strong>4 feet by 5 feet 5 inches.</strong> <strong>Canvas</strong> was first widely used in Venice,  because it was cheaper than wood. And unlike wood, canvas could stand up to humidity better.</p>
<p><strong>Oil painting</strong> was imported from Northern Europe. It quickly replaced tempera, a quick-drying paint bound by egg yolk that produced a flat, chalky, opaque surface.</p>
<p>This new medium was perfect for painting soft nudes and flesh tones. Also, when oil dries, it is somewhat translucent which allows reflection of light and results in a shiny surface. Titian even <strong>added ground up glass to his pigments</strong> to better reflect light.</p>
<p>The use of <strong>chiaroscuro </strong>or the effect of contrasting light and shadow, created from light that falls unevenly, is applied here.  Subtle changes of skin tone are apparent from her neck down across her chest and in between her breasts. Then it runs down across her torso and abdomen, along her thigh and towards her knee.</p>
<p>To achieve deep tones, Venetian painters would slowly apply <strong>glazes </strong>to build up layer upon layer of oil paint on canvas. Since oil dries slowly, the colors could be blended <strong>wet-in-wet</strong> (<strong>alla prima</strong>). On her body there are up to 15 layers of paint.</p>

<h5><strong>Proportion Play</strong></h5>
<p>Titian manipulated the portions of the woman’s body to make it especially elegant, soft, and rounded. The viewers eyes are drawn to her face, torso, and hips. Looking closer, her feet are too small for her body.</p>
<h5><strong>Complex Spatial Environment</strong></h5>
<p>The figure is placed forward, on a soft diagonal, from the upper left to lower right of her body.  The middle shows servants from a back view, along with a chest.</p>
<p>The canvas itself is divided into two, with the dark green curtains. This gives contrast to the woman’s face and torso, so the viewer cannot clearly see the details.</p>
<h5><strong>A Gift from the Duke</strong></h5>
<p>Titian painted this at the request of Duke Guidobaldo della Rovere of Urbino to his young wife Giulia Varano. It is not clear to the viewer who the subject is. It could be Venus, a courtesan, or the wife. Since this was a private commission, Titian may have painted Giulia. It may have hung over the marital bed.</p>
<h5><strong>What Does Venus of Urbino Represent?</strong></h5>
<p>This painting in an allegory of marriage in three parts. It represents:</p>
<p><strong>Eroticism:</strong> the woman is naked and represents Venus the goddess of love.</p>
<p><strong>Fidelity: </strong>the dog represents fidelity</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood: </strong>is represented by the two servants in the background, as the younger one is supervised.</p>
<h5><strong>Venus in Name Only</strong></h5>
<p>Naked paintings often had the word “Venus” in the title to make painting a naked woman more acceptable. That does not mean it in not a picture of a real woman.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story Unfolds </strong></h5>
<p>We know that the woman is sexually available, but faithful to her husband. Living in luxury is possible because of her husband’s status.  She is confident and possesses a coyness, as she looks right at the viewer.</p>
<h5><strong>Symbolism</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bedsheets:</strong> red, sign of love and romance</li>
<li><strong>Roses:</strong> are a sign of Venus and marriage and love</li>
<li><strong>Pearls:</strong> are a sign of Venus (from the shell she comes from)</li>
<li><strong>Dogs:</strong> can symbolize fidelity and faithfulness, but also carnality/sexuality</li>
<li><strong>Cassone:</strong> trunk intended for storage of clothing for wife’s dowry</li>
<li><strong>Luxurious home and servants:</strong> wealthy family</li>
<li><strong>Myrtle bush:</strong> common plant for weddings</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Titian and the Reclining Female Nude</strong></h5>
<p>Titian is credited with establishing the genre of the reclining female nude. He learned from his teacher Giorgione.</p>
<p>Most female nudes are recumbent, posed so that the viewer can see them, and asleep. This made for a  pleasant and undisturbed viewing experience for men, as the women in these paintings did not know the men were gazing upon them. This provides a sense of anonymity for the men and an enticing sense of voyeurism.</p>
<p>However, Titian changed the final detail. <strong><em>Venus of Urbino</em></strong> is awake. She is aware of the gaze, but she welcomes it.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Titian</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Titian (1488-1576)</strong> was considered one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance.  Born Tiziano Vecellio, in what is now Pieve di Cadore, Italy, he was an apprentice to Venetian artist Sebastian Zuccato.</p>
<p>His first major commission was Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, in Venice, in 1516. His work <em>Assumption of the Virgin</em>, painted for the church’s high alter, stablished his career.</p>
<p>Next, he created a work, inspired by mythology, <em>The Worship of Venus</em>, between 1518-1519, one of several commissioned by Alfonso I d&#8217;Este, duke of Ferrara.  Wealthy patrons continued to hire him, including King Philip II of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.</p>

Status</p>
<p>In the Santa Felicita Church, in <strong>Florence, Italy</strong>, there is a chapel, that was once owned by the Capponi family. They hired artist Jacopo da Pontormo, known as <strong>Pontormo. </strong>He created the large alter painting <strong><em>Entombment of Christ</em></strong>, measuring <strong>10 feet by 6 feet and 4 inches. </strong>It is a work created using<strong> oil on wood.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-728" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78-Close-Up-1.jpg?resize=400%2C542&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="400" height="542" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78-Close-Up-1.jpg?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78-Close-Up-1.jpg?resize=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1 221w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Worship and Wealth</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Entombment of Christ </em></strong>guided worship in the private chapel, designed by Brunelleschi. The work was visible to the public entering the church, yet it was blocked off to them. This shows the wealth and power of the Capponi family it was named for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-729" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78-Close-Up-2.jpg?resize=399%2C541&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="399" height="541" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78-Close-Up-2.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78-Close-Up-2.jpg?resize=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1 221w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>A Confusing Narrative</strong></h5>
<p>The Mannerist quality is intentionally confusing, unlike the clarity and precision of the Renaissance. In this case the viewer is unsure of the narrative. If this is the deposition, where is the cross and the ladder? If this is the pieta, why is there a crowd around? If this is the entombment, where is the tomb?</p>
<p>The Virgin Mary falls way from the viewer towards the back after she releases her dead son’s hand.</p>
<p>Christ is pale. The viewer can see stigmata. He appears to be of generous weight and yet his body is supported without effort. The two figures holding Christ have been interpreted as angels who, unaffected by the weight of Christ’s body, are lifting him towards God.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jacopo da Pontormo</strong> (1494-1557) was born as <strong>Jacopo Carrucci</strong>, in the Republic of Florence. (Italy) He was known for breaking away from the High Renaissance classicism into his more personal style of Mannerism.  As the son of painter Bartolommeo Carrucci, Pontormo apprenticed to Leonardo da Vince and later Mariotto Albertinelli and Piero di Cosimo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “The Best of Both Worlds”</strong></h3>
<p>This period is a blending of Italian practices (size, idealization) and a refinement of northern practices, such as realism.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1500-1600) </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther hangs 95 Theses in 1517
<ul>
<li>Many countries become Protestant, rather than Catholic</li>
<li>Power of the papacy was diminishing</li>
<li>European monarchs would rather be Protestant so as to not have to abide by the Pope.</li>
<li>Led to multiple civil wars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changing politics
<ul>
<li>Burgundian Netherlands is annexed by the Holy Roman Empire</li>
<li>Spain &#8211; through a series of carefully conceived marriages and successful military campaigns became the dominant European power</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The Northern artists were at a crossroads. The wealthy church was an eager patron to artists, yet many believed in Martin Luther.  Many artists try to avoid this dilemma by painting non-religious subject matter such as portraits and nature scenes.</p>
<p>The <strong>Iconoclastic movement</strong> was paintings and sculptures of holy figures attacked. This was part of the anti-Catholic sentiment and reaction towards the excesses and corruption of the Church.</p>
<p><strong>Prints</strong> made from woodcuts and engravings increasingly popular.</p>
<p><strong>Paintings </strong>featured high horizon lines, painstaking realism, and details. There was a reluctance to use linear perspective but rather atmospheric perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Sculpture</strong> was not common as it was interpreted as idolatrous.</p>
<p>As for <strong>Architecture</strong> the Italian High Renaissance style became popular using columns, pediments, and pilasters with Gothic verticality.</p>

<p><strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece by </em></strong><strong>Matthias Grünewald </strong>is an<strong> oil on wood artwork, </strong>with a central panel measuring  <strong>10 feet wide. </strong>Altarpieces are made from wood, so the panels can move.</p>
<p>A <strong>polyptych</strong> is a multi-paneled work , with two wings, one central panel, and a <strong>predella, </strong>or base that is painted. This is essentially a box of statues covered by folding wings <strong>multi-media</strong>, with <strong>three layers</strong>. Notice the stylized bodies, and dramatic colours.</p>
<h5><strong>Hospital of St. Anthony </strong></h5>
<p>The hospital was built by the Brothers of St. Anthony in a monastery at Isenheim.  St. Anthony was the patron saint of those suffering from skin diseases. This hospital specialized in ergotism also known as St. Anthony’s Fire.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Ergotism?</strong></h5>
<p>Ergotism is caused by eating fungus that grows in rye flour. Symptoms include skin infections, gangrene, convulsions, and hallucinations. This is not surprizing as the hallucinogenic drug LSD comes from the same strain of fungus.</p>
<p>The disease can also attack the central nervous system. If left untreated, it can lead to death.</p>
<h5><strong>How this Altarpiece was Used</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-734" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Another-view.jpg?resize=811%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="811" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Another-view.jpg?w=811&amp;ssl=1 811w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Another-view.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Another-view.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Another-view.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> was used during mass, in the monastic hospital of St. Anthony’s, for patients. It was positioned at the end of the room , so it was visible from bed. Not only does this work mirror the physical and emotional pain of the patients, but it also emphasizes miracles and an end to suffering.</p>
<p>Swinging the altarpiece open would split Christ’s body along his right shoulder. Amputations were common for ergotism sufferers.</p>
<p>The bright colors used on the altar piece could draw attention, even from patients in a hallucinatory state.</p>
<h5><strong>The Details of the Altarpiece</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-735" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Details-of-the-Altarpiece.jpg?resize=624%2C456&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="456" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Details-of-the-Altarpiece.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/77-Details-of-the-Altarpiece.jpg?resize=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The altarpiece was left closed until Sundays.</p>
<p>One the <strong>left wing of the closed work</strong>, is St. Sebastian, martyred by being shot with arrows. The pockmarks on his skin associated him with skin diseases.</p>
<p>On the <strong>center panel</strong> is the Crucifixion. <strong>Mary </strong>is swooning, dressed in the same as the nuns at the monastery hospital.  She is caught by the young and beardless <strong>John the Evangelist</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> appears on her knees, with hands clasped. She is pleading and looking up at Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Christ </strong>is deliberately painted to look as if he suffers from ergotism. Note the body marked by pox, and  dead and decomposing flesh. Christ’s hands are writhing in agony. His arms are almost torn from their sockets, and his body has been painfully lashed.</p>

<p>The <strong>lamb</strong> illustrated is Christ’s embodiment as a sacrificial lamb, carrying its own cross and bleeding into a chalice.</p>
<p><strong>John the Baptist</strong> is not commonly depicted at the crucifixion of Christ. Yet here he gestures towards the suffering body and holds a scroll which reads, “<em>He must increase, but I must decrease</em>.” Translation: put our ego second because God comes first.</p>
<p>On <strong>the right wing</strong> is St. Anthony Abbot, the patron saint of those suffering from skin diseases. (Pork fat was used to help heal skin, so he is often seen with a pig.)</p>

<p>On the <strong>left side</strong> St. Anthony is visited by St. Paul, the first hermit on the desert. The two are about to be fed by a raven in a tree. The meeting cured St. Anthony of the misperception that he was the first desert hermit. It was a lesson in humility.</p>
<p>The <strong>center</strong> represents three saints. St. Anthony is flanked by St. Jerome and St. Augustine.</p>

<h5><strong>In Context</strong></h5>
<p>Sculpted wooden altarpieces were popular in Germany before Protestantism. The <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></strong> however is a Catholic altarpiece.  This is one of the last major Northern altarpieces. Protestantism began in 1517.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>German born artist <strong>Matthias Grünewald, (1480 to 1528)</strong> was known for his religious works with intense color. In 1509, he became the court painter to the elector of Mainz, the archbishop Uriel von Gemmingen. <strong><em>Isenheim Altarpiece </em></strong>is considered his masterpiece.</p>

<p>This woodcut artwork entitled, <strong><em>Allegory of Law and Grace</em></strong> , by <strong><em>Lucas Cranach the Elder</em></strong><em>, </em>uses the <strong>crosshatching</strong> and <strong>hatching</strong> to show modeling.</p>
<p>The<strong> Letterpress,</strong> invented by Johannes Gutenberg in mid-15<sup>th</sup> century, was used for the text at the bottom. Moveable letters could be reinked and rearranged.</p>
<p>Prints are reproducible, simple to make,  and easy to distribute. Artists often made a good painted versions first, to work out the details.</p>
<h5><strong>What Does Woodcut Mean?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Woodcut</strong> is a form of relief printing.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>An image is carved into the surface of a block of wood (the printing part remains level with the surface, while the non-printing parts are removed or cut away)</li>
<li>Surface of block is covered with ink</li>
<li>Paper is applied to top to transfer image using pressure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h5><strong>Pros</strong></h5>
<p>Quick and cheap, a woodblock will last for a long time</p>
<h5><strong>Cons</strong></h5>
<p>Detail and intricacies are difficult to achieve, although most artists are capable. Woodcuts have not become a medium known for impressive expertise.</p>
<h5><strong>Protestant Reform </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Allegory of Law and Grace</em></strong> was created for the purpose of propaganda and is the single most important piece of Protestant Reformation. It is a comparison between Protestantism and Catholicism and was used to educate the viewer. Prints enabled cheap dissemination.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>The space is divided in half vertically. The Tree of Life is in the center. The left side reflects Catholicism and the philosophy of Catholic law. The right side illustrates Protestantism and the Grace, based on the belief in God’s grace.</p>
<h5><strong>Left Side: Catholicism</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Tree is dead on this side</li>
<li>Adam and Eve eat the fruit of the Tree of Life after being tempted by the serpent.</li>
<li>God sits above on an orb as the Judge represents the world.</li>
<li>He raises his left hand in damnation and right hand in blessing.</li>
<li>Mary and John the Baptist sit beside him.</li>
<li>Adam and Eve cause the world to be bound by sin.</li>
<li>A nude man, symbolically laid bare in front of God, is being run into Hell by Devil (L) and Death (R)</li>
<li> Children and the elderly are already in Hell through the Catholic dogma that people are bound to fail.</li>
<li>Moses stands to the side, holding the Ten Commandments.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Right side: Protestantism / Grace </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Tree is alive on this side.</li>
<li>Annunciation in the background with Mary standing on the hill.</li>
<li>John the Baptist directs a naked man to Christ on the cross.</li>
<li>The wound on his side made by Romans bleeds and spills out, manifests as the Holy Spirit which showers the same nude man, as God’s grace.</li>
<li>Christ is symbolized as a sacrificial lamb who holds his own cross.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Right Side Background </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>In the back left is a scene where Moses constructs a bronze serpent to cure Israelites, foreshadowing Christ’s healing power.</li>
<li>God punishes Israelites who complain that the promised land is not what they thought it would be by sending poisonous serpents to bit people.</li>
<li>In the back middle is the shepherds learning of the birth of Christ.</li>
<li>Christ emerged from the tomb after three days having defeated Death and the Devil.</li>
<li>The Protestant God also shows mercy and forgiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Text at the Bottom: </strong></h5>
<p>Left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Romans 1:18 (concerning judgment)</li>
<li>Romans 4:15 (concerning the Devil and death)</li>
<li>Matthew 11:13 (concerning Moses and prophets)</li>
<li>Romans 1:17 and 3:28 (concerning humanity)</li>
<li>1 Peter 1:2 (concerning Baptists)</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 15:54 (concerning Death and the lamb)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>Cranach is called the “Painter of the Reformation”. The artist produced these woodcuts in conjunction with Martin Luther about 13 years after 95 Theses.</p>
<p><strong>What was Martin Luther promoting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An exist for the future of Popes.</li>
<li>An abolishment of Latin services</li>
<li>For the Church to stop selling indulgences.</li>
<li>No more confession, just faith</li>
<li>An elimination of Catholic art that was used to display authority and extravagance.</li>
<li>The use of Protestant art to promote educate and promote hope.</li>
<li>Catholics were focused on laws and dogma, without focusing on a relationship with God.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lucas Cranach, the Elder</strong> (1472-1553) originally named Lucas Müller, was born in Germany. He was a leading painter and one of the most important artists in German art during the 16<sup>th</sup> century. He created numerous paintings, woodcuts, altar pieces, court pieces and portraits. Fascinated by the female form, he created innumerable pictures of women, from elongated female nudes, to fashionably dressed ladies, drawing from both the Bible mythology.</p>
<p>The artist never signed his full name to his works. In fact, the early pieces, before 1504 , did not contain his name at all.  From 1504 to 1506, he entwined his initials “LC”. Then, up until 1509, he signed works with his initials separated. Leading up to 1914, he added three initial and a winged serpent, which was he coat of arms. In 1515, he dropped his initial altogether and just used the coat of arms. This later method was also used by his son, artists Lucas the Younger.</p>

<p>This work by German artist <strong>Albrecht Dürer</strong> is an <strong>engraving</strong> of <strong><em>Adam and Eve, </em></strong>measuring <strong>10 by 8 inches. </strong>The artist shows off his talent in this difficult medium.</p>
<h5><strong>How was this Engraving Made?</strong></h5>
<p>An image is carved or <strong>incised</strong>, into the surface of a metal plate using a <strong>burin</strong>. This object is a tool, with a flat round top that fits into the palm of the hand. It has a short, sharp tip. The width and depth of the engraved line depends upon the angle the tool is used.</p>
<p>Once the surface is cut it is covered with ink. This pools into the incised area. The ink is then wiped away from the surface. The surface is then applied to paper with pressure.</p>
<p>The work uses <strong>hatching</strong> and <strong>cross-hatching</strong> to show value.  <strong>Hatching</strong> is a bunch of <strong>hatches</strong> or lines grouped together that are all going in the same direction. <strong>Cross-hatching </strong>is when groups of hatches cross over other hatches.</p>
<p>The artist’s monogram is included on the bottom corner of the sign in the work.</p>
<h5><strong>Influences</strong></h5>
<p>The nude figures were influenced by Italian art. The bodies are frontal and stand in <strong>contrapposto</strong>. Based on Vitruvian’s canon of proportions, where the face determines the proportions for the rest of the body. The  etching was inspired by two sculptures:  <em>Apollo Belvedere</em> and <em>Medici Venus</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Adam and Eve </em></strong>is an early example of the muscular, and contrapposto human form, in the North. The bodies, both male and female are idealized. Notice too the use of Latin and a reference to the Four Humors, an ancient Greek theory.</p>
<p>The Northern use of extraordinary minute detail and dark woods and cliffs are part of the beauty of this work.  Iconography plays a major role here  too.</p>

<h5><strong>Why was this Created?</strong></h5>
<p>Once an engraving was crafted, prints could be easily copied and disseminated to the religiously devout. The idea was promoted about temptation and sin.</p>
<h5><strong>What is this Engraving About?</strong></h5>
<p>Adam and Eve stand together in a dense, dark forest, right before the Fall of Man. This acts to humanize religion.</p>
<h5><strong>The Four Humors:</strong></h5>
<p>The Four Humors are a classical medical philosophy that maintained humans have four humors. When these are in balance, our personalities are perfectly at ease. When one of these is greater than the others, our personalities change.</p>
<p>Christians believed that in the Garden of Eden, before the Fall of Man, all the humors were balanced. After the Fall, Christians believed that one humor predominated in everyone, throwing our temperaments into imbalance.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconography</strong></h5>
<p>Here are some of the symbols in <em>Adam and Eve</em> along with what they mean.</p>

<p>In true Renaissance fashion <strong>Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528)</strong> was a master painter, printer, goldsmith, art theorist and human scholar. Born in Nürnberg, Germany, he first apprenticed with his father who was a goldsmith. Next painting called and he apprenticed in the studio of Michael Wolgemut for three years. Eventually he returned home to set up his own studio.</p>
<p>He was enthralled by Italy and travelled there often. He was nicknamed the “Leonardo of North” for introducing Northerners to Italian conventions.</p>
<p>Besides <strong><em>Adam and Eve</em></strong>, other famous works the artist created in his lifetime include: <em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Self Portrait with Fur-Trimmed Robe, Young Hair, The Feast of the Rosary, Praying Hands, Melencolia I</em>, and <em>The Rhinocerus</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Kunsthistoriches Museum, Vienna, Austria</p>
<p>This work entitled <strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em></strong><em>,</em> by <strong>Pieter Bruegel the Elder</strong>, is a painting <strong>using oil on wood</strong> and measuring, <strong>3 feet 10 inches by 5 feet 4 inches. </strong></p>
<p>In true <strong>Northern European</strong> tradition, the landscape has a high horizon. This enables the viewer to see more of it. To balance this, the figures also must appear smaller.  A strong diagonal line, leads the viewer into the painting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-768" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/83-Backgroun.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/83-Backgroun.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/83-Backgroun.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The figures in the foreground are not identifiable. Nor are the figures a short distance behind them, to the left. We do not see faces. The figures in the background are without real form.</p>
<h5><strong>Observing the Details</strong></h5>
<p>This<strong> Genre scene</strong> depicts the transformation and importance of the <strong>landscape</strong>. It is given meaning by daily routines and activities of people who inhabit it. Humans, depending on any given day can find both joy and difficulty in the landscape. It is typical of Netherlandish painting to put in <strong>many small narratives</strong> and details.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Hunters in the Snow</em></strong><em>, </em>the main subject, the hunters, are trudging through the snow looking for food. We can imagine they are cold and stressed, yet still trying to make sure the hunt is successful. The women are making a fire.</p>
<p>Down below, deep in the background, people oblivious to what is going on above are enjoying a day on skating on frozen ponds. All these things are happening in the beauty of the landscape.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-769" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/83-Teacher.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/83-Teacher.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/83-Teacher.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was one of a series created for Nicles Jonghelink, an Antwerp banker, merchant, and art collector. He had asked Bruegel for six paintings that captured the labors of the months.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep Winter</li>
<li>Early Spring</li>
<li>Late Spring (missing)</li>
<li>Early Summer</li>
<li>Late Summer</li>
<li>Fall</li>
</ul>
<p>Art historians think the artworks may have been commissioned for the purpose of nostalgia. The paintings could depict that humankind is of little importance. The seasons change and people are at the mercy of God and nature. Or the message could be that life is difficult but still enjoyable.</p>
<h5><strong>A Historical Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Hunters in the Snow </em></strong>was the first artwork in the in history of Western painting that brought  landscape paintings to a larger scale.</p>
<p>Dutch genre scenes showed normalcy and tradition even in times of great change and the spread of Protestantism. This combined with natural forces known as Little Ice Age from 1550-1700. <strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Short Artist Biography: </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pieter Bruegal the Elder (1525-1569)</strong> was the most important member of the Netherlandish family of artists. He was known for bringing a human quality to his works. Many of his works focus on the lives of common Flemish people, with village settings and an eye for detail.</p>

<p>Born in Breda, he eventually settled in Antwerp. There he studied a masters of painting at Guild of St. Luke. He started his career making prints and engravings. Ultimately, his landscaped were widely commissioned.</p>

<h5>This section encompasses <strong>15th Century Renaissance Art</strong> from both the <strong>South and the North.</strong></h5>
<h3><strong>15<sup>th</sup> Century Southern Renaissance</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Theme: “Rebirth”</strong></h4>
<p>The Renaissance was a rebirth of classical ideals that spanned across media and disciplines: fine arts, literature, history, philosophy.  Renaissance artists and patrons were influenced by humanism and a growing interest in the secular over religious concerns.</p>
<h5><strong>ART :</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Space and light</li>
<li>Perspective and proportion</li>
<li>Anatomy</li>
<li>A renewed passion for mythology</li>
<li>A new social status and celebrity of artists</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>In the Beginning</strong></h5>
<p>The Black Death screamed across Europe and Asia with electric speed killing more than 20 million people in Europe  alone. As a result, survivors were left wealthy from inheritances. This resulted in a decline in the feudal system and autonomy for citizens. New men were now in positions. Art helped to give them prestige.</p>
<p>Books were being printed and now widely distributed through J. Gutenberg, in 1440. Reading was no loner for the privileged few. Migration of Greek scholars and texts from Constantinople to Europe after the conquest by the Ottoman Turks (1453).</p>
<p>The Vatican in fear of the Counter-Revolution and Luther sponsor Renaissance art as a way to bolster the church.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Context (1400-1500 CE)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Ruling Families</strong></p>
<p>Italian city-states, including <strong>Florence, Naples, Rome, Siena, and Venice</strong> were wealthy and controlled by powerful families.</p>
<p>The <strong>Medici </strong>family <strong>from Florence</strong> were the most important of all. They were bankers and moneylenders who were lavish patrons of the arts and learning</p>
<figure id="attachment_658" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-658" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-658" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lorenzo-de-Medici-Image.jpg?resize=300%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="408" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-658" class="wp-caption-text">Lorenzo de Medici Image</figcaption></figure>
<h5><strong>Feuding Families of Florence</strong></h5>
<p>The Renaissance started in Italy and Florence was its core. Here the wealthy Florentines could afford to support artistic careers. The most powerful family were the Medici clan, who were bankers and rulers of Florence for more than 60 years.</p>
<p><strong>Cosimo the Elder,</strong> founder of the <strong>Medici dynasty</strong> spent gigantic amounts of money to beautify Florence with stunning architecture and artworks. His grandson Lorenzo the Magnificent continued supporting the arts. The powerful <strong>Pazzi family,</strong> another banking clan, were long time rivals of the Medici family. Both did anything for prestige and to help hide their corruption.</p>
<p>This competition extended to the art world and kept artists and architects both continually and gainfully employed. It also helped to show their piety to the church. This artistically rich feud between the two families ended after <strong>The Pazzi Conspiracy, in 1478</strong>, when the Pazzi family were tossed out of Florence.</p>
<p>Other Italian city-states would follow the Renaissance movement, including Rome, Milan, Venice, Bologna and Ferrara. From Italy, it travelled to France and then onward to western and northern Europe.</p>
<p>The movement first expanded to other Italian city-states, such as Venice, Milan, Bologna, Ferrara, and Rome. Then, during the 15th century, Renaissance ideas spread from Italy to France.  The war between the two countries sparked an interest in Renaissance art! Greater trade between Italy and the rest of Western Europe increased it further.</p>
<h5><strong>The Republic of Florence and David</strong></h5>
<p>In the 14th century, Italy consisted of independent city-states geographically centered on a major city. As a wealthy but small city-state, <strong>the Republic of Florence identified with David</strong>, from the Hebrew Bible. Florence perceived itself as an underdog standing against the larger forces of tyranny, paralleling itself with the account of David and Goliath from the Hebrew texts.</p>
<p>In this story,<strong> Israel was at war with the Philistines</strong>, and it was common practice to send a representative warrior from each side out to battle instead of risking both armies in battle. The <strong>Philistines sent out their champion, Goliath,</strong> who was over nine feet tall. He intimidated the army of Israel and <strong>all warriors refused to fight him, except David, a young boy at the time</strong>. Refusing to use the king’s armor and weapons, David instead used a slingshot, hurling a stone directly into Goliath’s forehead and killing him. David then used Goliath’s own sword to sever the giant’s head.</p>
<p><strong>Donatello’s bronze<em> David</em></strong>, thought to be the first freestanding nude since antiquity<strong>, first occupied the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici, home of the Medici family</strong>. As Florence’s cultural leaders, the Medici gathered around themselves the city’s foremost intellectuals, literati, and artists.</p>
<p>For the Medici, artistic patronage was propaganda, similar to that of Rome and Augustus. It was used to articulate and negotiate political power and to craft a public persona. As patrons, the Medici were unmatched. They sponsored numerous public and private works, cementing their image as benevolent benefactors and guardians of Florence&#8217;s cultural patrimony.</p>
<p>David stands naturally, in relaxed contrapposto, his foot resting on the severed head of Goliath with the enormous sword supporting him like a staff. Donatello departed from current convention and sculpted David nude, like a young Eros instead of a Christian hero. His extreme youth correlates to the biblical story but departs from classical forms of heroism of a more muscled, less sensuous body.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-494" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69-David.jpg?resize=298%2C509&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="298" height="509" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69-David.jpg?w=195&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69-David.jpg?resize=176%2C300&amp;ssl=1 176w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The classically inspired nudity theoretically alludes to David’s refusal to wear armor.</p>
<p>By adopting and displaying such a popular civic symbol, the Medici identified themselves with the city of Florence, which they indirectly sought to rule. By identifying with the young David, they cast themselves as patriots with their fellow citizens to defend the independence of the city. This is echoed in an inscription on the base of the statue:</p>
<p>&#8220;The victor is whoever defends the fatherland. God crushes the wrath of an enormous foe. Behold! A boy overcame a great tyrant. Conquer, o citizens!”</p>
<h5><strong>Humanism</strong></h5>
<p>An interest is humanism developed that included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A world view focused on humans.</li>
<li>To perfect individuals, study of past models of civic and personal virtue were taught.</li>
<li>Values emphasized personal effort and responsibility.</li>
<li>A physically or intellectually active life was directed at a common good, as well as individual nobility.</li>
<li>An exploration of lands beyond Europe resulted in interests in science, trading, and arts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>classical cultures of Greece and Rome</strong> provided Humanists with a human-centered model for living derived from reason.</p>
<p><strong>Humanism is a philosophy and a cultural movement that downplayed religious doctrine</strong> and <strong>emphasized education, expanding knowledge, the exploration of individual potential, moral duty, and commitment to civic responsibility. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Humanists emulated Roman civic virtues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-sacrificing service to the state</li>
<li>participation in government</li>
<li>defense of state institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>The reward for civic virtue was fame, and heroes of the past were edified in a manner previously reserved for saints.</p>
<h5><strong>Renaissance — Realism</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Tribute Money</em></strong> is a <strong>continuous narrative fresco</strong> depicting the Biblical story of the coin in the mouth of the fish. This exemplifies the <strong>changing characteristics of art and architecture between the medieval era and the Renaissance.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2341" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Tribute-Money.jpg?resize=800%2C356&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="356" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Tribute-Money.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Tribute-Money.jpg?resize=300%2C133&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>The Tribute Money</em>. Masaccio. Brancacci Chapel, Church of Santa Maria del Carmine. Florence, Italy. ca. 1425–1427 C.E. Fresco</strong>.</p>
<p>The highlighting of a virtuous act, figural and landscape realism, and use of linear perspective all underscore the impact of Renaissance ideas and departure from medieval characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Left:</strong> Jesus instructs Peter to look in the mouth of a fish for a gold coin. This was one of Christ&#8217;s miracles.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Realistic hills, water, and trees are visible in <strong><em>The Tribute Money</em></strong>, along with classical architecture, such as columns and high arches, instead of the gold or other flat-colored backgrounds common in medieval representation. The distant mountains and trees exemplify Masaccio’s use of linear perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Human Figures</strong></p>
<p>The human figures are fully clothed, but their <strong>realistic musculature is evident beneath their cloaks</strong>. Their facial expressions and repeated gestures, along with the continuous narrative, support the story-telling aspect of the painting. The bright colors of their cloaks dominate the composition against the cool, receding blue and white background.</p>
<h5><strong>San Lorenzo—Use of Math</strong></h5>
<p>Marking the start of the extensive patronage of the Medici family, the <strong>Church of San Lorenzo</strong>, which replaced an 11th century C.E. basilica, <strong>recalls early Christian buildings in Rome</strong> with its coffered flat ceiling, the balanced arrangement of arches, and the uninterrupted wall between the arches and clerestory windows.</p>

<p><strong>Exterior of the <em>Church of San Lorenzo</em>. Filippo Brunelleschi, continued by </strong><br />
<strong>Michelozzo di Bartolomeo. 1421–1470 C.E. Florence.</strong></p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>Classical influence</strong> is reflected in a rational, balanced, and calm geometric simplicity. <strong>Brunelleschi</strong>, the architect, completed plans for the church between 1421 and 1428 C.E. but died before the building was finished. <strong>Michelozzo</strong>, another architect, supervised the completion of the interior. The façade was never built.</p>
<p><strong>Renaissance Italians considered geometric proportions as reflections of God&#8217;s divine order</strong>, seen in the mathematically arranged floor plan.</p>
<p><strong>Brunelleschi</strong> studied and measured the remains of ancient architecture, such as the Roman Pantheon. This, coupled with Brunelleschi&#8217;s broad knowledge of mathematics and engineering, informed his distinct, classicizing style, which emphasizes simple, clean lines, geometric forms, and harmonious proportions. There are square bays in the side aisles leading to rectangular chapels. The nave is two modules wide; the crossing, sanctuary, and each arm of the transept are perfect squares—two modules by two modules. The distance between columns is equal to their height and twice the radius of the arches, giving the idea of perfect proportions and harmony.</p>
<h5><strong>Brunelleschi, He Had a Plan</strong></h5>
<p>The floor plan of the <strong>Church of San Lorenzo</strong> is similar to the <strong>Chartres Cathedral</strong>. However, it has a pendentive cupola, or dome, where the nave and transept intersect. The dome is separated into twelve equal sections surrounding the oculus. Brunelleschi’s cupola design involved an octagonal drum that supported a ribbed, pointed dome, rather than a hemispherical one.</p>

<p>The taller, narrower, and pointed dome would create less outward thrust, like the pointed arches and vaults of Gothic cathedrals. The dome&#8217;s octagonal shape allowed the addition of eight stabilizing ribs, again like Gothic vaults.</p>

<p>Brunelleschi used a similar cupola in the <strong>Pazzi Chapel </strong>in an effort to impart a centralized effect, a reflection of the Classical influence from buildings like the Pantheon.</p>
<p>Brunelleschi used a two-color scheme of pietra serena and white stucco to articulate the building&#8217;s modular structure. Flattened architectural forms, including pilasters and cornices, in pietra serena repeat the arcade on the outer walls of the side aisle, further reinforcing the design&#8217;s basic patterns and structures and evidence of Classical influence.</p>

<h5><strong>Illusion of Naturalism—Italian Style</strong></h5>
<p>In the 14th century, there was an <strong>emerging naturalism and humanism in art and architecture</strong>. The classification of this time is debated. It can be considered the <strong>late Medieval era or the early Renaissance</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Gradual Shift Towards Naturalism and Humanism</strong></h5>
<p>The artists in the Renaissance didn’t have a meeting and decide that they were going to change things and bring back antiquity. The change happened slowly as naturalist and humanist influence spread, <strong>causing an overlap of medieval and Renaissance characteristics</strong>. This resulted in Renaissance-inspired artists emerging at different times in different geographical regions, beginning in Italy. As they are studied, they are classified by their stylistic characteristics and subject matter.</p>
<h5><strong>Giotto</strong></h5>
<p>The humanized narrative and careful spatial construction of Giotto’s <strong><em>Lamentation</em></strong> represent early Italian Renaissance style. The sorrowful scene of the <strong><em>Lamentation</em> </strong>has a realistic, natural background. A tree at the summit of the rocky outcropping is dry and leafless, as if nature is mimicking the sorrow and the lifeless state of Jesus.</p>
<figure id="attachment_442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-442" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-442" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=700%2C550&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="550" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-442" class="wp-caption-text">Lamentation<br />© Scala/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>The diagonal ledge guides the eye downward from the upper right of the panel to the emotional focal point: <strong>Mary holding Jesus in her arms</strong>, just as she did when he was an infant. As Mary cradles Jesus and looks into his face, the viewer can empathize with the very human experience of loss and the love of a mother for her son.</p>
<p>The rocky ledge creates spatial depth, as if the figures are gathered before a theatrical backdrop on a shallow stage. Closer to the foreground, <strong>two anonymous figures are depicted from the back</strong>, suggesting that space extends beyond the fresco to invite and involve the viewer in the artwork, further humanizing the narrative and urging emotional involvement. Similar figural and spatial naturalism is found in Masaccio’s <em>The Tribute Money</em>.</p>
<h5><strong>Lippi</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lippi’s use of perspective, natural backgrounds, and somber colors reflects Masaccio’s influence</strong>. Lippi&#8217;s work is characterized by a delicacy and realism reflective of humanist thought. He painted Mary, who was a popular theme at this time, many times, and his attention to informal details resulted in a decorative and psychologically intriguing style.</p>
<p>Lippi&#8217;s <strong><em>Madonna with Child and Angels</em></strong> is typical of his later work. The engaging composition presents strikingly human presentations of Mary, Jesus, and angels, one of whom engages the viewer with a playful glance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-454" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71-Madonna-and-Child-with-Two-Angels.jpg?resize=484%2C712&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="484" height="712" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71-Madonna-and-Child-with-Two-Angels.jpg?w=223&amp;ssl=1 223w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71-Madonna-and-Child-with-Two-Angels.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The detailed <strong>drapery and halos recall Gothic art</strong>, but a landscape replaces a plain, icon-inspired background. Sky and fragmented hills are framed as though appearing through a window, adding a sense of perspective without the use of geometric columns.</p>
<p>Of the figures in the painting, Mary is the most realistic and lifelike, characterizing her role as intercessor for humanity. Her three-dimensionality is accentuated by the three-quarters view of her face. This realism and attention to naturalistic figures and setting were part of a growing trend to humanize Biblical figures to make them more lifelike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Botticelli</strong></h5>
<p>A favored painter for the Medici family and a student of Lippi, Botticelli painted the <em>Adoration of the Magi </em>for Guaspare del Lama, the Medici family’s lawyer, to be the altarpiece for a funeral chapel in Santa Maria, Novella. The painting includes representations of the Medici family depicted as Magi.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2354" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Adoration-of-Mgi.jpg?resize=706%2C575&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="706" height="575" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Adoration-of-Mgi.jpg?w=706&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Adoration-of-Mgi.jpg?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Adoration of the Magi</em>. Sandro Botticelli. Florence, Italy. 1475 C.E. Paint on canvas</strong>.</p>
<p>The naturalism in the figures and landscape and linear style similar to Lippi and the use of perspective are <strong>evidence of Renaissance influence</strong>. However, in his painting the <strong><em>Birth of Venus</em></strong>, he strays from this representation and focuses on the <strong>symbolic and allegoric aspects of Venus</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-542" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/72-Birth-of-Venus-ENHANCED-1.jpg?resize=700%2C440&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="440" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/72-Birth-of-Venus-ENHANCED-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/72-Birth-of-Venus-ENHANCED-1.jpg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-542" class="wp-caption-text">Birth of Venus<br />© Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the <strong><em>Birth of Venus</em></strong><em>,</em> the subject, a Greek goddess, stands nude in a half-shell. The impression here is chaste and alluring, reminiscent of medieval tales of courtly love, in which there was no sex between the lovers, only admiration from a distance.</p>
<p>Although he studied under Lippi, the <em>Birth of Venus</em> lacks the intense geometry of Botticelli&#8217;s teacher. In contrast with the specific emotional expressions strived for by artists such as Masaccio, Venus&#8217;s ambiguous expression has been characterized as everything from inviting to serene.</p>
<p>Botticelli did not characterize Renaissance ideals of perfection in perspective or proportion. Venus&#8217;s neck is overlong, her shoulders decline steeply, and her left arm is awkwardly arranged. The intent is not physical perfection, but physical emotion.</p>
<h5><strong>Pietro Perugino</strong></h5>
<p>Under Pope Nicholas V, the church emerged as a major patron of the arts and re-established Rome as a center of the arts. Future popes, like Sixtus IV, made use of the many craftsmen flocking to the revived city. Perugino was <strong>invited by Pope Sixtus IV to decorate the Sistine Chapel</strong>. Only three of Perugino&#8217;s frescos in the Sistine Chapel survive.</p>
<p>In the <strong><em>Delivery of the Keys</em></strong>, Christ and Peter stand in the foreground between a frieze-like display of Apostles and figures contemporary to Perugino. A golden key, pointing toward Christ, is the key to heaven, while a lead key, pointing downward, is the key to hell. The figures here are graceful, elegant, and highly idealized in form and posture. Peter is the first pope; by showing Christ giving him the keys, this painting suggests the legitimacy of papal rule.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Delivery of the Keys</em>. Pietro Perugino. Sistine Chapel, Vatican. 1481–1482 C.E. Fresco.</strong></p>
<p>This composition represents the artist&#8217;s attention to symmetry and linear perspective. The frescoes are painted at eye level, meant to make viewers feel as though they are a part of the narrative, similar to Da Vinci’s <em>Last Supper</em>. The calm, carefully rendered figures are almost secondary to the powerful geometry of the paved square and monumental architecture.</p>
<h5><strong>Renaissance </strong><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>Powerful ruling families became innovative patrons. This encouraged competition in the arts and it flourished. In Italian, <strong>quattrocento</strong> means 400 and is the shortened form of 1400 that refers to the 15<sup>th</sup> century. This was a time of new enthusiasm of the work from ancient Greece and Rome that artists brought to their paintings, sculpture, and architecture. Italian artists of this time moved away from illuminated manuscripts to painting on panels or large-scale fresco painting.<strong>Florence </strong>was the main centre for early Renaissance art, so the term <strong>quattrocento</strong> is used as a general term to describe all early Renaissance art.<br />

<h5><strong>Painting</strong></h5>
<p>Attention to the <strong>human form</strong> became a focus with a return of <strong>classical male nudity</strong> and <strong>contrapposto</strong>. All figures were firmly constructed, regal and graceful. Profile pose remains customary in Florence until about 1470.The discovery of <strong>linear perspective</strong> created the illusion of 3D space. Artists had a rational order and logical relation among figures and objects. A balanced, symmetrical compositions, often pyramidal was achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Chiaroscuro, </strong>using the contrast of light and shadows was used to model forms. Additionally, the use of single light source provided greater realism.There was an increasing demand for devotional images for private chapels and shrines. This contributed to increasing secularization of traditional subject matter, as well as many frescos. While the first half of this period was dominated by <strong>religious scenes</strong>, the second half was devoted to <strong>portraits and mythology</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>For sculptural works, there was a return of <strong>large-scale statuary</strong>—the type that had not been seen since Ancient Rome. Great attention was paid to the male form and contrapposto.</p>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>Classical forms were now incorporated into architecture, through <strong>triumphal arches</strong>, <strong>domes, coffers</strong>, and harmonious <strong>geometric</strong> relationships. Building were based on harmony and proportion.  Roman portrait busts were being found and preserved in greater numbers.</p>

<p><strong>David, </strong>a work by artist <strong>Donatello</strong>, is a nude, sculpture-in-the-round, <strong>made of bronze</strong>, in a revival of classical techniques. <strong>Lost-wax casting</strong> was used to create this hollow sculpture.The work depicts an ideal form of a man and it is almost life sized <strong>at  5 feet 3 inched tall.</strong> Smoothness achieved on the skin helps create a sense of suppleness and eroticism.  Contrapposto gives it a sense of movement.</p>

Both were interested in a revival of the classics. Yet, it isn’t apparent which member of the family requested the sculpture.The work was mot for public viewing.  It could however,  be viewed from the street through the opening gate to the Medici courtyard and home. This biblical subject was used to achieve political motives of the Medici.</p>
<h5><strong>The Battle Between Florence and Milan </strong></h5>
<p>In 1428, there was a great battle between Florence, a mercantile republic, and Milan, a military autocracy. The Florentines were not expected to win, but they did. As the underdogs, they claimed God was on their side.While Florence might have been a republic in name, the Medici clan actually ruled Florence. They placed multiple family members and allies in governmental positions. while ruling the city corruptly.Henceforth, the Medici family began to affiliate themselves with the biblical figure David.  In the Bible, David is a king, with a long rule, who is enormously wise. The symbolism was David represented Florence, which equalled the Medici family. In opposition, Goliath was Milan and the Duke.</p>
<h5><strong>Appropriation</strong></h5>
<p>Florence ousts the Medici and uses the same political metaphor against them. Once the Medici clan was exiled, Florence, city officials took the statue of David and moved it to the city hall.The family were absent between 1494-1512. After, when they returned to retake the city, they did not pretend to be a republic anymore. They became an autocracy.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of David</strong></h5>
<p>In the Old Testament David, is a young Hebrew shepherd, who slayed Goliath, with a simple sling shot.  He was the only one brave enough. David knew he could do it, with God’s help.Donatello picked that moment in the story to portray his triumphant David. The emphasis is not on bravery, but rather on success.</p>
<ul>
<li>David’s stance is nonchalant, jaunty, and assured though his head is lowered to suggest humility.</li>
<li><strong>Right hand</strong>: holds Goliath’s own sword&#8211;notches have been nicked out of it from many battles and it is rough bronze.</li>
<li><strong>Left hand</strong>: holds a rock used to slay Goliath</li>
<li>David stands on Goliath’s decapitated head as a sign of total supremacy.</li>
<li>David wears a soft hat, rather than a helmet like we might expect, and boots.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Why is David Nude?</strong></h5>
<p>Many have asked this question. Surely, David was not nude when he defeated Goliath. This is <strong>Heroic nudity</strong> in art. It implies morality, truth, and virtue. David is not considered a “true nude” however. He still wears a hat and boots!Does this nudity also lead to some eroticism? Are there homoerotic overtones? Or is this depiction of an adolescent just typical for the time?David is something of an androgynous figure. David’s body is that of an adolescent – not really a boy but certainly not a man yet. There is a softness, and an emphasis on the curvature of his body. The delicacy of his hat emphasizes an effeminate nature about him. The feather from Goliath’s helmet actually runs up David’s leg to touch his buttocks.</p>
<h5>The Sculpture in Context</h5>
<p>This work was created as a result of the classical revival’s interest in humanism.For 1,000 years, since the fall of Rome, the Christians had looked at the soul, as the focus of what art should be about. The body was seen as a source of sin and it was not to be celebrated. This was the source of original sin. Think Adam and Eve in Garden of Eden.Returning to the ancient Greek and Roman love and respect for the body was now viewed as radical. This was the first life sized, freestanding, bronze, nude sculpture since antiquity.</p>
<h5><strong>About Donatello</strong></h5>
<p>Florentine artist, Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi,(1386-1466) known as Donatello, was a master in sculpture using both marble and bronze. <strong> </strong>Donatello is best known for <strong><em>David</em></strong>, but other famous works include <em>Equestrian Statue of Gattamelate, Penitent Magdalene, </em>and<em> Saint George.</em></p>

<p>The Pazzi Chapel , in <strong>Florence, Italy</strong>, a work of <strong>masonry</strong>, was designed by architect <strong>Filippo Brunelleschi</strong>, and constructed after his death.  This chapel is off the cloister that is attached to the <strong>Basilica of Santa Croce. </strong>This architecture of <strong>Pazzi Chapel</strong> symbolizes a huge departure and contrast from the Gothic style. It utilizes a classical revivalist style based on what the Greeks believed to be the perfect shape&#8211;a circle.Based on the Pantheon, the architecture utilizes a dome as the central architectural principle and exterior that hides the dome.</p>
<h5><strong>The Exterior</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-665" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/67-Another-Exterior-Shot.jpg?resize=786%2C516&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="786" height="516" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/67-Another-Exterior-Shot.jpg?w=786&amp;ssl=1 786w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/67-Another-Exterior-Shot.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/67-Another-Exterior-Shot.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The outside of the structure uses a classical vocabulary with rounded arches, fluted columns with Corinthian capitals, and a semicircular dome. The front is based on Roman triumphed arch.The portico, with a small dome overhead, has six Corinthian columns.  The portico dome is decorated with the coat of arms of the Pazzi Family, which features two dolphins.</p>

<p>Stone benches run along the length of the walls.  Architectural elements are clearly defined with the use of <strong>pietra serena</strong>, a gray stone. Terracotta <strong>roundels, </strong>or decorative plates made by atists Luca della Robbia depict the Four Evangelists<strong>Function</strong>This chapel was provided by the Pazzi family to atone for their sins and do good work, in the eyes of the Church.  It was originally used as a <strong>chapter house, </strong>or meeting room for monks for private discussions and prayer. The Pazzi family also used it as a funerary chapel.</p>
<h5><strong>A Chapel of Perfect Mathematical Harmony</strong></h5>
<p>Although the interior appears plain, the beauty of the chapel is in the mathematical harmony. This was believed to be to be proof of the perfection of God and the Heavens.</p>
<h5><strong>The Notorious Pazzi Family</strong></h5>
<p>This chapel was commissioned by Andrea Pazzi, head of a wealthy banking family, in 1429, as a house for monks. The violence between the Pazzis and Medicis was so disruptive that it halted the project. <strong>The Pazzi Conspiracy of 1478</strong> resulted in the family being exiled from Florence.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Architect</strong></h5>
<p>Florentine <strong>Filippo Brunelleschi</strong> <strong>(1377-1446)</strong> spent time in Rome learning about ancient buildings. The Pantheon epitomized Brunelleschi&#8217;s style. Geometric form, both inside and out was the most distinctive feature of his architecture. A prime example of his work is the Florence Cathedral.A Renaissance man, Brunelleschi combined architecture, with work in sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design.Brunelleschi worked on <strong>Pazzi Chapel</strong> starting in 1429, until his death in 1446.  His workers continued it afterwards,  but the project was never fully finished.</p>

<p>The Colosseum is the inspiration for the <strong>stone and masonry</strong> façade of <strong>Palazzo Rucellai</strong>, in <strong>Florence, Italy,</strong> by architect <strong>Leon Battista Alberti. </strong></p>
<p>Both use tripartite division of exterior and architectural features for decorative purposes,  rather than structural support. The order of columns changes from least decorative to most decorative, or  heaviest to lightest.There is a <strong>tripartite</strong> façade  on three stories.</p>
<p>Each floor decreases in actual height and perceived “weight” as it goes. With a clear progression from floor to floor, there is a classical sense of proportion. <strong>Stringcourses</strong> divide the floor with long horizontal molding.The first floor is heavily <strong>rusticated</strong> to express the fortitude of the family. It uses the <strong>Tuscan </strong>order in its pilasters, with larger stones that are harder edged and square.</p>

<p>The third floor is the shortest, with less articulation. It uses Corinthian order in its <strong>pilasters</strong> and smaller stones used. Heavy <strong>cornice</strong> caps the roof.The palazzo was created by using eight existing houses that were gutted and unified on the façade.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was the Palazzo Created ?</strong></h5>
<p>This was built to be a private home for the wealthy Florentine merchants the Rucellai family. This was a display of status, wealth, and power. It symbolises  a Renaissance desire for rationality, order, and classicism.Frieze carvings contained billowing sails which were the symbol of the Ruccelai.</p>
<p>The family wanted to base the building on ancient Rome architecture and Colosseum, The family felt a connection to Rome and desired to have their family members reach the ranks of cardinals and even Popes.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Florentine Palazzo</strong>The first floor was where business was conducted. On the second floor the family received guests. The third floor was used for private rooms for the family. The fourth floor was hidden from the exterior and housed the servants.</p>
<h5><strong>About Alberti</strong></h5>
<p>Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) was an Italian author, artist, architect, poet, philosopher, and humanist. As was the first Italian architect to study Roman architecture in depth, he travelled to Rome, where the Colosseum had a great influence on his work.</p>
<p>Alberti wrote <strong><em>De Re Aedificatoria</em></strong>, containing his thoughts on ideal architecture. He developed his style, by adding classical elements to contemporary buildings and advocated a system of ideal proportions. A point of argument for Alberti was that the arch and column commonly used in Gothic churches, was incongruous.</p>

<p>This work by <strong>Fra Filippo Lippo</strong> was created using <strong>tempera</strong>, a mix of pigment and egg yolk, <strong>on wood</strong> panel, measuring <strong>3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet and 2 inches</strong>.</p>
<p>The “Fra” part of the artist’s name means “monk”. And indeed, he was one! Renaissance paintings were referred to as “windows into the world”.  Not only is that supposed to refer to the illusionism and representation of the painting, but Lippi used a windowsill and window frame to show us that idea.The Byzantine/Gothic elongations of the hands, face and body have been replaced with a solidarity of form, but with an emphasizes her delicacy and prettiness.</p>
<p>Lippi is known for his delicate swirls of transparent fabric, with an emphasis on lines and curves. He uses <strong>chiaroscuro </strong>the gradual contrast between light and dark to show roundness and a sense of volume.The landscape is realistic using <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>, shows the natural blurring of  blue gray tones that occurs when our eye moves back into space.</p>
<h5><strong>Who Commissioned This Work?</strong></h5>
<p>Lippi’s major patrons were the wealthy Medici banking family, yet no one knows for sure if they commissioned it. Historians know that it was used to guide worship and payer, and as a sign the display the piety of the owner.</p>
<h5><strong>The Human Side of Religion</strong></h5>
<p>The scene was a popular type in the Italian Renaissance, as it helped to humanize religion. It reminds the viewer that Mary was a normal mother and Christ her beloved son.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Mary’s hands are devoutly clasped in prayer. Her youth and beauty are evident, with her hair elegantly embellished with pearls and a veil. There is just a glint of a halo. Yet, she seems a little sombre and Christians believed this was her foreshadowing about what would happen to her son.</p>
<p>Playful, childlike angles stand around. Christ appears like a naturalistic, normal baby. Gone are the Gothic like depiction of him as an old-man baby.The backdrop is a seashore, with rocks and land indicating the safe haven of the church. The city is meant to be Heavenly Jerusalem. Mary was referred to as the “port of salvation.&#8221;</p>
<h5><strong>Renaissance Philosophies</strong></h5>
<p>During the Renaissance, the classics were revived along with the three classical philosophies<strong>: Idealism, Humanism, Rationalism</strong>. All three are depicted in this work.</p>
<p><strong>Idealism:</strong> Mary is depicted in her idealized youth.</p>
<p><strong>Humanism:</strong> Mary and Christ are depicted as in a family portrait.</p>
<p><strong>Rationalism:</strong> Mary and Christ are calm; they do not exhibit emotion; they are restrained</p>
<p><strong>The Story of the Painter</strong><strong><em>Fra Filippo Lippi</em></strong><em>, although a monk, had a seedy side to his nature. Vasari, the first art historian and 16<sup>th</sup> century Renaissance painter, wrote about Lippi in his book Lives of Artists. </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em> </em><em>It is said that Fra Filippo was so lustful that, he would give anything to enjoy a woman he wanted it he thought he could have his way. If he couldn’t buy what he wanted, then he would cool his passion by painting her portrait. </em><em>His lust was so violent that when it took hold of him, he could never concentrate on his work. Because of this, when he was doing something for Cosimo de’ Medici, his main patron, Cosimo had to have Lippi locked in so he wouldn’t wander off. </em></p>
<p><em>One time, after Lippi had been confined for a few days, Fra Filippo’s amorous, or rather animal, instincts, drove him one night to seize a pair of scissors, make a rope from his own bedsheets and escape through a window to pursue his pleasures for days on end!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Vassari continues he story by saying that at a certain point Cosimo just had to give in and learn to treat the painter with respect. The prevailing attitude was that art was created by a skilled worker. Cosimo learned that the artist had to be inspired to create.And Lippi continued to be inspired.</p>
<p>He painted an alter piece for the nuns of St Margherita in Prato.There, he saw a beautiful nun named Lucrezia Buti. He abducted Lucrezia and kept her in his house, despite the nuns’ attempts to get her back.</p>
<p>Lucrezia inspired the images of his female figures, with her pale alabaster soft skin and strawberry blonde hair. The image of Mary in <strong><em>Madonna and Child with Two Angels</em></strong> is based on her.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fra Filippo Lippi</strong> <strong>(1406-1496)</strong> was born in Florence. In 1420, he was registered to the Community of Carmelite friars of the Carmine in Florence. He took his vows at age 16. The prior noting that the teen loved to draw in his notebooks, allowed him to learn to paint.  Soon after, the budding artist tried to quit the order, but the request was denied. He was appointed to work for a convent and then a rectory.</p>
<p>He continued to paint, but it is rumored that the money he received was spent on women. It is also rumored that Lucrezia Buti bore him a son. The son was named Fillippino Lippi. While he too would become a famous painter, who his mother may have been was never certain.</p>
<p>Filippo Lippi died while working on the frescos in the asp of Spoleto Cathedral. Fillippino completed his father’s work.</p>

<p><strong>Sandro Botticelli’s</strong> masterpiece <strong><em>Birth of Venus</em></strong>, is painted with <strong>tempura on canvass </strong>and<strong> measures 5 feet 6 inches by 9 feet.</strong> It is based on the classical sculptures of Venus.</p>
<p>The Medici family owned the sculpture <em>Modest Venus</em>, so the artist was able to study it. Fine modelling or <strong>chiaroscuro</strong> and the white flesh color add to the sculptural appearance of Venus. The <strong>contrapposto</strong> positioning adds to the grace.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the <em>Birth of Venus</em></strong></h5>
<p>The classical subject matter <strong>shows Venus, the goddess of love, being born, as a fully formed woman</strong> and physically perfect.  Hesiod, a classical poet, said Venus was conceived when Chronos castrated his father, Uranus, whose severed organs fertilized the sea foam.</p>
<p>The <strong>goddess is depicted on a shell</strong>, the sign of Venus. Pink roses are scattered before her. The classics say roses were created at same time as Venus, indicating love is beautiful, but can be painful.</p>
<p>Venus is then blown towards the shore of Cyprus, by Zephyrus, the god of the wind. His cheeks are puffed out. Entwined around him is a nymph, either Chloris or Aura. At the shores waits Flora, the goddess of Spring or a handmaiden.</p>

<p>Venus has a faraway look in her eyes, as if not bothered by mortal concerns. She exhibits Renaissance philosophies<strong>: Idealism, Humanism, Rationalism</strong>.<strong>Classical with a twist.</strong></p>
<p>Botticelli’s Venus is based on the <strong>Modest Venus pose</strong> that was particularly popular in the classical Greek era. This pose involves Venus covering up her breasts and hips.</p>
<p>Botticelli would have seen these sculptures through his patrons, the Medici, who owned a number of classical sculptures of Venus. Despite being based on classical sculptures of Venus, Botticelli’s version has unusual dimensions.</p>
<p>She has <strong>elongated portions</strong> in her neck, left arm, and torso. Her <strong>serpentine pose</strong> is gravitationally impossible, The figures around her float, without anchor to the ground. In fact, they do not give of shadows.</p>
<p>The landscape is flat. The waves are v shaped. There is a great emphasis on pattern, from the flowers free floating in the air to the left, to the flowered fabric to the right. The seashell gives a patterned look of light and dark stripes. This reminds the viewer that it is a two-dimensional work.</p>
<p>Botticelli uses the technique of pushing figures forward onto a parallel plane to the picture plane, with a background behind them. This is based on ancient Greek vase painting where figures are isolated from the background. The artist emphasizes a graceful curving linearity, rather than a calm rational sense of space. Notice the delicate, twisting, curling lines.</p>
<p>Botticelli mixed expensive <strong>alabaster powder i</strong>nto the pigment to make the colors brighter. The artist also added exquisite <strong>gold leaf</strong> into Venus’ hair.<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-673" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Venus-Close-UP.png?resize=500%2C415&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="415" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Venus-Close-UP.png?w=317&amp;ssl=1 317w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Venus-Close-UP.png?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Canvas Versus Wood</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong><em>Birth of Venus</em></strong> is one of the first paintings ever to be painted on canvas. Using canvas was cheaper than wood, which allowed for much larger paintings. Canvas also withstands humidity well. Whereas wood can warp. The one drawback was that canvas was considered informal, so it was only used for non-official works. Yet, the mediums used to create this work are of a superior quality.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>No documentation associated with the painting has been found. Vasari does mention this as a Medici painting in his book. It was painted for Lorenzo de’ Medici, the powerful head of the Medici clan, at the time.</p>
<p>Historians think that the inspiration for Venice was Lorenzo’s mistress Simonetta Cattaneo. She was also the mistress of his brother Giulio de’ Medici!</p>
<p>Both Lorenzo and Botticelli were interested in the revival of ancient myths. This work was unusual at the time, because not is the almost life-sized and nude, she is not portrayed in a biblical context. Some scholars think it was placed in a bedroom, due to its sexual nature.</p>
<h5><strong>A Christian Interpretation</strong></h5>
<p>After Savonarola’s death, when a new level of religiosity spread through Florence, a Christian interpretation of this painting emerged. This made the work more acceptable at the time. Some ideas included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nudity of Venus echoes that of Eve in Garden of Eden.</li>
<li>Venus was interpreted as a personification of the Church</li>
<li>One of Mary’s nicknames is “stella maris” – star of the sea</li>
<li>The sea gives birth to Venus just as Mary gives birth to Christ</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Philosophy Based on Platonism</strong></h5>
<p>Platonism was a popular philosophy in Renaissance times. It stated that the contemplation of physical beauty enabled the human mind to comprehend spiritual beauty. It justified the serious study of classical nudity, or any nudity, as a way to understand God’s capacity to create beauty and perfection. Historians consider this an excuse to study nude woman. woman.</p>

<p>Botticelli’s painted women tend to have a certain look to them: light strawberry blonde women with fair alabaster skin. Sound familiar? Lippi was Botticelli’s teacher, so Botticelli learned from his master’s examples.</p>

<h4><strong>Theme for 15<sup>th</sup> Century Northern Renaissance:</strong><strong>“Extreme Realism” </strong></h4>
<p>Artists of this period created works that are renowned for their incredible and extremely high level of realism. Artists could achieve this detail given that they began to work with oil paint, instead of the flaky and dull tempera paint common in the south of Europe.</p>
<h4><strong>Historical Context (1325-1500 CE)</strong></h4>
<p>The regions during the Northern Renaissance period included:</p>
<p><strong>France (Burgundian)</strong><br />
<strong>Flanders (Belgium)</strong><br />
<strong>Holland</strong><br />
<strong>Germany</strong><br />
<strong>England</strong></p>
<p>Much of Northern Europe grew increasingly wealthy and mercantile during this period. This inspired cultural growth. Cities continued to compete regarding churches, altarpieces, and town halls.<strong> </strong></p>

<h5><strong>Illusion of Naturalism–Northern Style</strong></h5>
<p>The governments in northern Europe continued to move toward centralized royal governments in the 15th century, but the paralleled decline of feudalism brought social disorder. A new economic system emerged, and in response to the financial requirements of trade, new credit and exchange systems created an economic network of resourceful European cities.</p>
<p><strong>Art of Northern Europe in the 15th century</strong> is known for its unprecedented attention to detail, and it thrived under royal, ducal, church, and private patronage. <strong>Printmaking emerged</strong> as a major art form, and <strong>oil-based pigment became the leading medium for painting</strong>.</p>
<p>Separate <strong>symbols blended to form a grand narrative in art</strong>, and there was continued <strong>Humanistic movement toward more realistic figures placed in naturalistic settings</strong>. Light, shadow, and reflection were commonly used along with surface realism.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece</em>)</strong>, a triptych commissioned by the Ingelbrechts family, was not meant for public display. Authorship of this retable is unknown. Because the piece is unsigned, scholars attribute the work to Robert Campin, an early master artist from Tournai, Belgium.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-453" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/66-Annunciation-Triptych.jpg?resize=851%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="851" height="436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/66-Annunciation-Triptych.jpg?w=496&amp;ssl=1 496w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/66-Annunciation-Triptych.jpg?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Unique features of the petite sized <strong><em>Merode Altarpiece</em></strong> are in the depiction of interior space and the inclusion of daily life with Christian evangelism.</p>
<p>Each of the three panels portrays an intimate setting surrounded by everyday details. Typical of northern European art, <strong>the details</strong> are created with as much attention as the overall focus. The <strong>lines and wrinkles in the figure’s faces</strong>, along with the extreme <strong>details in the building elements</strong>, like the bricks and wood grain, are evidence of the surface realism. This contrasts with the three-dimensional realism used in Italian Renaissance works like the <strong><em>Delivery of the Keys</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Northern Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>Mystery surrounds the intention of the <strong><em>Arnolfini Portrait</em></strong> by Jan van Eyck—is it the engagement, the actual wedding, a ceremony after the wedding, or a memorial? The man and his wife are bourgeoisie, not royalty. The man, believed to be Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini, was a merchant from Lucca, Italy, who lived in Bruges, Belgium.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-946" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68-The-Arnolfini-Portrait-2.jpg?resize=600%2C839&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="839" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68-The-Arnolfini-Portrait-2.jpg?w=238&amp;ssl=1 238w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68-The-Arnolfini-Portrait-2.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Their <strong>financial means is represented</strong> in their fur-lined clothes and nicely furnished bedroom. Holding her dress high, the wife gives the coy illusion of being pregnant. This is reiterated through the green color of the dress; the color is associated with fertility and symbolizes the couple&#8217;s hope that they will have children. The illusion of surface realism is seen in the folds and textures of the fabric, the wood grain, and the hair on the dog.</p>
<p>The <strong>Arnolfini Portrait</strong> presents a world that is <strong>both realistic and symbolic</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Engravings</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Engraving is the process of cutting a metal surface to produce decoration</strong>, different from the intaglio technique known as etching because acid is not used to remove the metal from the plate. The plates were covered in ink and wiped so that the ink only remained within the carved recesses. The plate was then pressed onto paper using a press, which transferred a mirror image of the engraving. Printmakers did not have to follow the orders of a patron; decisions were determined by which images would sell. Engravings provided lightweight, relatively inexpensive devotional images.</p>
<p>A devout Christian, <strong>Albrecht Dürer</strong> was influenced by his religious beliefs and the philosophy of Humanism. This outlook led him to combine the empirical study of nature with the mathematical relationships that expressed harmony and the ideal proportions expounded by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius and the Renaissance Italian artists who emulated him, such as Leonardo. Dürer ceased production of paintings and woodcuts in 1514 C.E. During this time, he created 13 engravings, including <strong><em>Adam and Eve</em>.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-71" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=527%2C668&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="527" height="668" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?w=258&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The figures are examples of the arithmetic ratio-based Vitruvian theory of human proportions. The figures stand in balanced contrapposto poses like classical statues, which Dürer was exposed to through graphic representations. <strong><em>Adam and Eve</em></strong> represent Dürer’s concept of the “perfect” male and female figures.</p>
<p>The symbolic representations in the engraving are like those in Northern art. The tension between the cat and mouse in the foreground represents the strain between Adam and Eve when Eve persuades him to eat the apple. The animals represent humanity’s temperaments from medieval physiology: choleric, melancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>The<strong> International Gothic Style </strong>remained dominant. There was a humanization of religious subject matter.The art of <strong>painting </strong>was dominated by guilds. Painters used horizontal lines and rich though disguised <strong>symbolism</strong>.</p>
<p>The paint that gained prominence among artists was <strong>oil paint</strong>, that started to be used in the late middle ages. It could imitate textures far better than fresco or tempera. Glazes in thin layers helped create a depth of colour. Every object in the scene was given clarity and light.</p>
<p><strong>Print making </strong>included printing and engraving. Within <strong>sculpture </strong>complete independence of form was not yet achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture </strong>was inspired by flamboyant Gothic church architecture, as secular buildings took on a new look.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-680" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66.-Center-Panel.jpg?resize=870%2C897&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="870" height="897" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66.-Center-Panel.jpg?w=870&amp;ssl=1 870w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66.-Center-Panel.jpg?resize=291%2C300&amp;ssl=1 291w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66.-Center-Panel.jpg?resize=768%2C792&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Center Panel</strong></h5>
<p>The center panel shows <strong>Northern Ren characteristics</strong>.</p>
<p>The angel Gabriel has just entered the Virgin Mary’s home and is about to announce that she will be the mother of Jesus. Mary is still unaware of the angel’s presence. She is seated on the floor, indicated that she is humble. Above her are beamed ceiling. There is a second story to this home showing great wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Disguised Symbolism in the Center Panel</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Towels and water are a symbol of cleanliness. Think baptism, Mary’s cleanliness,  purity and Jewish prayer cloth.</li>
<li>Flowers are white lilies, called the Madonna Lillies, symbolizing Mary’s purity</li>
<li>Three buds are a symbol of Trinity</li>
<li>Unopened bud, opened bud, dying bud.</li>
<li>Mary holds the bible in a cloth, like her body holding the Christ child/piety.</li>
<li>Scroll and book on table symbolize the Old and New Testament with a supremacy of New vs Old.</li>
<li>Lion finials on the benches symbolizes the king of animals like Christ is king of men.</li>
<li>There are 16 sides to the table, reference to 16 main Hebrew prophets.</li>
<li>The table is supposed to be an altar. Angel Gabriel wears the clothing of a deacon.</li>
<li>Mary blocks the entrance of fireplace, commonly thought of as the way the devil enters.</li>
<li> Folds of Mary’s cloth form a star. Mary was queen of Heaven.</li>
<li> A candlestick. The flame is typically symbol of God’s presence. A candle going out is foreshadowing Christ’s crucifixion.</li>
<li>The sun shines through the oculus window bringing a cross. Christ enters with out breaking glass as in the divine conception.</li>
<li>Christ heads straight towards the white lilies symbolized Mary’s purity.</li>
<li>Christ heads toward her ear. This symbolizes the word of God, spoken by Angel Gabriel, that was heard by Mary was the way she became pregnant.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Right Panel</strong></h5>
<p>Joseph in his carpentry workshop. The cult of St. Joseph was becoming increasingly popular, as he was loving father and head of holy family. The mousetrap is a common symbol of capturing the devil.</p>

<h5><strong>The Left Panel</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-682" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66-The-Left-Panel.jpg?resize=371%2C527&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="371" height="527" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66-The-Left-Panel.jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/66-The-Left-Panel.jpg?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The left panel is the donor panel. It shows the patrons kneeling before the holy scene, with a messenger in the background. The messenger is carrying an important letter to the family.</p>
<p>The donor is believed to be Engelbrecht of Mechelen, a burgher, or city councilman. The status and piety of both he and his wife is evident. The wife is wearing a dress with an excess of fabric in the sleeves. This is fashionable, but not necessary, showing a sign of wealth. She holds prayer beads and looks down in humility. He takes his hat off as a sign of respect. The couple are witnessing the Annunciations. The viewer is expected to think these two people are pious even to bear witness to this important religious event.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>What was the Function of the <em>Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece)?</em></strong></h5>
<p>This piece was commissioned as a private piece that could be portable. The altarpiece was meant to encourage piety. Given it is an Annunciation scene, this was likely meant to parallel this couple’s own hopes for a child.The work was also a sign of status. The new middle class wanted to buy art to decorate their homes.</p>
<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>This altarpiece was executed in phases. It is thought that the central panel was probably not commissioned. Artists often created them, know that they would sell.The male donor, Engelbrecht of Mechelen ordered the wings. After getting married Engelbrecht’s wife and the messenger were added in. The windows of the central panel were originally gold  but were then painted with a blue sky and the shields were added.</p>

<p><strong><em>Arnolfini Portrait </em></strong>is an <strong>oil on wood</strong> painting measuring <strong>2 feet by 8 inches and 2 feet</strong> is attributed to Jan Van Eyck.</p>
<p>Oil paint is rich and takes a long time to dry. This allows artists to work to create very small and minute details. Artists can work in wet-in-wet, which means that wet layers of paint are applied to still wet layers of paint. This allowed Van Eyck to make glazes and to blend color.</p>
<p>Each layer is thin and translucent. Classical model for bodies have not been used in this work. Gothic style remained in the North during this time frame. Notice the thin elongation of the woman and in particular her hands.</p>
<h5><strong>The Duke of Burgundy’s Painter</strong></h5>
<p>Van Eyck was the court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. He may have commissioned this as a gift to the couple in the portrait.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-685" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Chandelier.jpg?resize=637%2C515&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="637" height="515" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Chandelier.jpg?w=637&amp;ssl=1 637w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Chandelier.jpg?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is the <strong>home of a wealthy couple.</strong> There are expensive objects everywhere.  The brass chandelier was elaborate by contemporary standards. It has a mechanism with pulleys and chains to lower it for putting new candles in and lighting them.</p>
<p>Rugs were considered a luxury item and there is a small oriental rug on the floor here.  Also, there are oranges on the windowsill, an expensive fruit, as it had to be imported from Spain.</p>
<p>This is the couple’s living room, although there is a bed. These pieces of furniture were often elaborate and expensive, so they were placed here for guests to see.</p>
<p>The couple’s clothing and jewelry also illustrate understated  wealth. The man wears a tabard of what looks like silk velvet, trimmed with fur. Under this is a silk doublet with silver cuffs. His hat is plaited straw.</p>
<p>The woman wears a green, wool overdress, with elaborately wide sleeves and long train, trimmed in fur. Her garment was made with an excess of fabric.</p>
<h5><strong>Traditional Gender Roles</strong></h5>
<p>The placement of figures shows us conventional 15<sup>th</sup> century gender roles. As the caretaker of the home, the woman stands  near the bed – caretaker of the home.  The man stands near window. His role takes place outside of the home.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconography and Symbolism</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>Arnolfini Portrait</em></strong></h5>
<p>uses a tremendous amount of iconography and disguised symbolism. <strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single candle </strong>may allude to the presence of the Holy Spirit as a witness.</li>
<li><strong>Shoes cast off </strong>indicates they are standing on holy ground.</li>
<li><strong>Green of woman’s dress </strong>symbolizes hope.</li>
<li><strong>Covered hair with white cap </strong>symbolizes purity and that she is already married.</li>
<li><strong>Red curtains </strong>show the physical act of lovemaking.</li>
<li><strong>Cherries </strong>outside on the tree are a sign of fertility.</li>
<li><strong>The finial on the bed </strong>is St. Margaret, the patron saint of childbirth<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The spotless mirror </strong>is a symbol of Mary, referring to her miraculous conception and purity, and that of the woman in the portrait.</li>
<li><strong>The dog, </strong>a Brussels griffon is a symbol of fidelity from the Latin word fido.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-686" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Mirror.jpg?resize=771%2C642&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="642" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Mirror.jpg?w=771&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Mirror.jpg?resize=300%2C250&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/68.-Mirror.jpg?resize=768%2C640&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></em></strong></p>
<p>The <strong>mirror on the back</strong> shows more of the room that is painted in the work. It also reflects two figures in the doorway. One is probably the painter, and the other is a witness. Van Eyck wrote an inscription over the mirror “Jan van Eyck was here 1434,” likely because he literally was when he witnessed this ceremony. The small medallions set into the frame shows a tiny scene from the Passion of the Christ.</p>
<p>The couple are receiving guests, but what is about to take place is unknown. Their hands are a central component depicting commitment. They must be already married, as an unmarried woman would have her hair down and loose during this time.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Arnolfini Portrait </em> </strong>is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art because of the iconography. Historians believe we are seeing Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife Giovanna Cenami. Arnolfini was a member of a merchant family from Lucca, Italy living in Bruges in Belgium<strong>. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Flemish artist <strong>Jan van Eyck</strong> or Johannes de Eyck <strong>(1395 &#8211; 1441)</strong> was considered one of the best Northern European painters of the 15th century. He perfected new and remarkable techniques with the medium. This included minute and extremely realistic depictions of surfaces and natural light.In 1422, he worked in The Hague for John of Bavaria, the ruler of Holland. Next, from 1425-1428 he was the painter for the Duke of Burgundy. When the Duke was about to take a wife, van Eyck traveled to her home in Portugal to paint her.The painter had many commissions throughout his life from religious works to portraits of courtiers, nobles, churchmen, and merchants.</p>
<p>His work entitled <strong><em>Portrait of a Man</em></strong> is thought to be a self-portrait.<strong> </strong>Another notable work by Jan van Eyck is the <strong><em>Ghent Altarpiece</em></strong>, painted with oils on 12 wooden panels.</p>
<h5><strong>More 15<sup>th</sup> Century Northern Renaissance Art </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</em></strong>, by Albrecht Dürer, is an example of the <strong>German Renaissance</strong>, more precisely of <strong>Nuremberg</strong> because the artist masters the Renaissance perspective technique, as well as the wood printing one. His approach to printmaking is dynamic with a clearly practical orientation. At the end of the 15th century, Nuremberg was a flourishing merchant city with silversmiths, instrument makers and more. It was linked by trade with the cities of Northern Italy.</p>

<p>Nuremberg was also an important center for the development of illustrated books, which gradually opened the city to the humanist culture. In Nuremberg, humanism of Renaissance was allied with the interest of patricians, scholars and craftsmen for science and technical innovation.The artist is clearly both a painter and a printmaker. Durer, the German Renaissance artist started as an apprentice in book workshops, among wood engravers and printers</p>
<p>.<strong>In Comparison</strong>His artwork, <strong><em>Adam and Eve, </em></strong><em>which he made slightly later in 1504</em><em> (<a href="https://medievalarthistory.org/16th-century-art/">16th Century Art Collective</a>)</em> reflects a taste for technical innovation and engravings, doubled by a profound knowledge of human anatomy and perspective rules,.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-71" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=522%2C662&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="522" height="662" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?w=258&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/74-Adam-and-Eve.png?resize=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1 237w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Both engravings are religious compositions treated with a naturalist and humanist touch. Compared with the gentle motion suggested by the contraposto positions of <strong><em>Adam and Eve</em></strong>, the composition of <strong><em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</em></strong> is highly dramatic.</p>
<p>Both artworks highlight the wood painting skills of the artist in the negative as one must cut away the substance of the design.</p>
<p>The riders, symbolizing the Conquest, the War, the Pestilence (or Famine) and the Death marked the imagination of the Christian world. They were often represented in the Middle Ages and continued to be during Renaissance.</p>
<p>In Durer’s print we identify the riders by their weapons. The conquest has a bow, war a sword, and the pestilence a set of balances fluttering in disarray behind the rider. In the book of Revelation, written around 60 AD., by John, the fourth has no weapon. John only says that death’s horse is pale, but Durer gives him a pitchfork and a skeletal horse. The world trembles under the horses’ hooves and they unleash the cataclysm of the end of the world.</p>
<p>Among the trampled is the figure of a bishop, which illustrates that like many Germans of his epoch , Durer’s has an open hostility to the papacy and the clergy, and at least initially he enthusiastically welcomed the preaching of Luther.What makes Durer’s print memorable is its evident naturalism and a strong diagonal movement. The four riders partially overlap. Perspective rules allow them to emerge realistically and create a black volume that advances towards the more whitish sky covering it. We can see why the reprinting of Durer’s engraved plates and woodblocks continued after his death. His prints served for over a century as models for altarpiece shutters, frescoes, bas-reliefs, or stained glass.</p>

<p>In true Renaissance fashion <strong>Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528)</strong> was a master painter, printer, goldsmith, art theorist and human scholar. Born in Nürnberg, Germany, he first apprenticed with his father who was a goldsmith. Next painting called and he apprenticed in the studio of Michael Wolgemut for three years. Eventually he returned home to set up his own studio.</p>
<p>He was enthralled by Italy and travelled there often. He was nicknamed the “Leonardo of North” for introducing Northerners to Italian conventions.Besides <em><strong>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</strong></em> and <strong><em>Adam and Eve</em></strong>, other famous works the artist created in his lifetime include: <em>Self Portrait with Fur-Trimmed Robe, Young Hair, The Feast of the Rosary, Praying Hands, Melencolia I</em>, and <em>The Rhinocerus</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>14th CENTURY ART</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-645" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=990%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="555" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Art-Title-Page.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Art-Title-Page.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Growing Interest in Reality”</strong></h3>
<p>The Florentines began to pursue art forms that rendered the world around themselves more realistically. Bodies begin to return to mass-like forms, drapery fell naturally, and an elegant and decorative style developed. They rejected the popular trend of the Late Gothic.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1250-1400)</strong></h5>
<p>There are two opposing art movements in the 14<sup>th</sup> century:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late Gothic / International Gothic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Gothic style was very popular throughout Europe. It symbolized craftsmanship and decorative design. Figures were rendered with elongation and delicacy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proto-Renaissance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Regions like Florence, Pisa, and Siena began to investigate art and use it as a medium to display important ideas or messages. During the Middle Ages, Italian city-states became wealthy as banking and trade became dominant interests in the Mediterranean world. Humanism developed. An investigation of the classical past and the study the accomplishments of humans became a central concern.</p>
<h5><strong>Guilds</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-646" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=990%2C317&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=1024%2C328&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?resize=1536%2C492&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14th-Century-Guilds-Picture.jpg?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Artists worked in <strong>guilds</strong> which were similar to unions. This worked organize apprenticeships, help artists, set prices, provide materials, and regulate commissions. This created artistic workshops which were free to join. The members were predominantly male, and it was rare to have females.</p>
<p>This existed until free markets of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h4><strong>(3) 62. </strong><strong>Röttgen Pietà</strong></h4>
<p>Late Medieval Europe (German). 1300–1325 (14<sup>th</sup>). Late Gothic/International Gothic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-536" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-536" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/62-Rottgen-Pieta.jpg?resize=500%2C850&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="850" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/62-Rottgen-Pieta.jpg?w=193&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/62-Rottgen-Pieta.jpg?resize=177%2C300&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-536" class="wp-caption-text">Röttgen Pietà<br />© Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Late Gothic sculpture</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Biblical<br />
Death<br />
Religion<br />
Devotional object<br />
Stylized bodies<br />
Male/female relationships</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Bonn, Germany</p>
<p><strong>Röttgen Pietà </strong>is a small painted wood sculpture measuring <strong>34 inches tall. </strong>It retains its original paint,  with browns, reds, and golds.</p>
<p>The  dark colors emphasize the physicality of the body, which is depicted as both limp, but rigid in pain. This late Gothic style is more able to capture this feeling, while retaining the features of delicate elongation from Early Gothic. The Crown of Thorns, wiry body and crumpled fabric creates.</p>
<h5><strong>Creating an Emotional Response</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The goal of <strong>late Gothic sculpture</strong> was to create an emotional response in the viewer. Churchgoers were confronted with agony, death, and sorrow. This was very different from the  jubilant images of Christ that they normally saw in early Gothic art.</p>
<p><strong>Andachtsbild</strong> (end-ACHT-speeld) is the German word for devotional image. It puts human pain in perspective and reminds us of Christ’s sacrifice and Mary’s great suffering. Religious figures are therefore humanized.</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look at Röttgen Pietà</strong></h5>
<p>The Virgin cradles Christ after he has been removed from the cross. Christ is emaciated, through living an ascetic life of deprivation to achieve greater spirituality. He is drained of blood and stiff in rigor mortis.</p>
<p>The horror of the Crucifixion is evident. <strong>Stigmata </strong>is visible on his hands and feet. The Crown of Thorns has caused his face to bleed. Mary’s face is twisted in anger, confusion,  and anguish, as tears roll down her face.</p>
<h5><strong>A New Christ</strong></h5>
<p>The is an early, medieval representations of Christ that is focused on his divinity. Prior  to this Christ was depicted on the cross but did not suffer. Eventually, by the late middle ages or late Gothic era, this new focus on a suffering Christ emerged.</p>
<h5><strong>Art Reflecting Life</strong></h5>
<p>Suffering was part of the 14<sup>th</sup> century. It was a difficult time with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundred Years War</li>
<li>Plague</li>
<li>Famine</li>
</ul>
<p>Artwork suddenly took on <strong>a tragic tone</strong>.  Fearful churchgoers sought comfort and reassurance in the idea that Christ and Mary understood their suffering and the woes of humankind.  Scenes of the Pieta and Mary’s suffering became very common.</p>
<p>This led to a period of worship called Marian Devotion. Mary was seen as an accessible, warm, motherly intercessor who could advocate for humankind through Christ.</p>
<h5><strong>Gothic Goes International</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Late Gothic Era</strong> was so popular across Europe that it is known as International Gothic. This German work illustrates just that.</p>

<p>This Gothic style of text was popular across Europe. It included the elongation of thin, delicate figures, lack of logical space, and Gothic decorative architectural elements.  Gold-leaf backgrounds were often frequently used.</p>
<p>The word <strong>haggadah means narration in Hebrew.</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong>, this <strong>illuminated manuscript, using pigment on vellum</strong>, the scribe was Jewish and someone who knew how to write in <strong>Hebrew</strong>. It is written from right to left. Some pages have just text. Other pages have miniatures that were<strong> illustrated.</strong> There are 56 of these in total.</p>
<p>The artist was Christian and someone who knew the style of Christian illuminated manuscripts. It contains anachronistic styles of clothing and homes that does not match the historical information of the Biblical era.</p>
<p>This is one of the most luxurious examples of a <strong>Haggadah</strong> ever created. The gold illumination led to the name <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function of the <em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong></h5>
<p>The pages contain the narrative Passover that include a celebration meal called a <strong>Seder</strong>. It was made for a wealthy Jewish family in Barcelona. This was one way of displaying the status and wealth of the owners.</p>
<p>Books were incredibly expensive to make at that time. The <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong> was even more so with its extensive use of extra gold illumination. Therefore, it was more ceremonial in nature, than a book to read. It is still in excellent condition.</p>
<h5><strong>Inside the Book</strong></h5>
<p>Haggadahs include prayers and readings said during the Seder, along with images to help contribute to the storyline.</p>

<p>At the top right, Miriam, the sister of Moses, and her maidens dance and play musical instruments. The instruments have Islamic motifs on them.  At the top left, the master of the house, sitting under a canopy, orders the distribution of matzoh and haroset to the children.</p>
<p>At the bottom right, the house is cleaned for Passover and leavened bread is removed. At the bottom left, sheep are slaughtered.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of Passover</strong></h5>
<p>This is the story of a miraculous salvation from slavery. It is tradition to recount it annually at Passover <strong>Seder</strong>. The evening begins, when a child at the table asks, “Why is this night different from all other nights?” This sets up the ritual narration of the story of Passover, when Moses led the Jews from slavery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moses tries to ask Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go,</li>
<li>Pharaoh says no.</li>
<li> God works through Moses to deliver ten plagues to Pharaoh, each one worse and worse, to force Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go.</li>
<li>Finally, the greatest plague God could send was the death of all first-borns, to protect Hebrew families.</li>
<li>God instructs Hebrews to mark their doors with animal blood so that the Angel of Death will <strong><em>pass over</em></strong> those homes.</li>
<li>Pharaoh’s oldest child, his son and heir to the throne dies.</li>
<li>Pharaoh is devastated and agrees that God must be who he says he is.</li>
<li>Pharoah lets the Hebrews go.</li>
<li>Moses tries to lead the Hebrews to the promised land.</li>
<li>Pharaoh regrets this and sends his army after them.</li>
<li>To allow the Hebrews to escape, Moses parts the Red Sea.</li>
<li>When the soldiers arrive, Moses lets the sea go. It washes away all the soldiers.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story of the</strong> <strong><em>Golden Haggadah</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong>Although the 2<sup>nd</sup> commandment in Judaism forbids the making of graven images, the haggadah were exempt from this rule. This was because they were seen as educational and not just decorative.</p>
<p>This is an example of <strong>cross-cultural</strong> borrowing in medieval Spain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian illuminated manuscript format appropriated by Jews.</li>
<li>Jewish text</li>
<li>Spanish artist</li>
<li>Spanish Jewish family</li>
<li>Islamic musical instruments</li>
</ul>
<p>Wealthy Jewish families often worked as advisers, physicians, and financiers so they were exposed to Christian court styles.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations of the Proto-Renaissance</strong></h5>
<p>Artists became important social figures. These artists still worked in guilds. They made contracts with patrons, but now they began to sign their works. This indicated the growing importance and risning status of the artist.</p>
<p>In <strong>architecture</strong>, height and width were stressed. In churches, there wide naves, rib vaults and clerestories.</p>
<p><strong>Painting</strong> included different styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Florentine: </strong>large-scale panels; fresco and tempera; achieve 3D reality; Cimabue + <em>maniera greca</em>; Giotto moves towards substantiated reality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sienese: </strong>decorative with rich colors; thin, elegant, courtly figures; figures are well proportioned; deep recessions into space.</li>
<li><strong>International Gothic style</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Sculpture</strong> was influenced by classical models, realistic masses and draperies,  horror vacuii and cluttered compositions.</p>

<p>The architect of the Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel in Padua, Italy is unknown. <strong>Artist Giotto di Bondone,</strong> designed the interior space so complementary to the exterior, that many believe he may have also been the architect of the <strong>42 feet tall structure.</strong></p>
<p>Unadorned, and <strong>made of brick</strong> on the exterior, and vastly decorative on the inside, it utilizes the old Christian symbolism of beautiful interior (soul) and austere exterior (body).</p>
<p>The simple basilica planned as an AKA rectangular barrel-vaulted hall.</p>
<h5><strong>Painting Frescoes</strong></h5>
<p>A<strong> buon fresco</strong>, or a wet or true fresco, starts with an application of wet plaster onto a wall. The wet plaster is then painted with <strong>tempera</strong> paint, made with egg yolk and pigment. This method  enables the paint to soak into the plaster, rather than just painting it and letting it dry on top of the wall. This makes the work durable, but speed is important.</p>
<p><strong>Giornata</strong>, in Italian is an art term meaning “a day’s work”. When creating a buon fresco, an artist must complete it in a day. When it dries the paint changes color, and it is impossible to remix the paint to match exactly.</p>

<p>The figures in Giotto’s frescoes are painted in <strong>sculpturesque style</strong>. They are weighty, full-bodied figures, with a convincing spatial depth. The bodies are rounded and naturally make shadows through modeling.</p>
<p>The figures also exhibit a foreshortening, by turning parallel to the picture plane and receding back.  The composition is simple using a shallow stage.</p>
<p>Blue paint is used on the ceiling and in every panel to create visual unity. It is doted with gold stars, as if the viewer is looking into Heaven.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was the Chapel Built?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel</strong> was built for Enrico Scrovegni, from a prominent banking family. He wanted to atone for his sins of charging interest on a loan or the act of usury. Dante, in his novel, <em>Divine Comedy</em> even singles out the Scrovegni family for this sin.</p>
<p>It was named Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel, because it was right by an old Roman area, which was part of the Scrovegni estate.  This kind of art was known as good work to help the patron earn his way into  heaven.  Enrico Scrovegni himself appears in the Last Judgement fresco on the side of the blessed.</p>
<p>The chapel was intended for the private use of the Scrovegni family. It was a sign of great wealth to be able to build such a place.</p>
<h5><strong>Frescos Inside the Church </strong></h5>
<p>There are three registers of paintings, in reference to the Trinity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top level: life of Mary starts with her parents Joachim and Anna.</li>
<li>Middle level: Life of Jesus (Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Flight to Egypt)</li>
<li>Lower level (closest to churchgoers): Passion of Christ (return to Jerusalem à Resurrection)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The altar wall: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annunciation at the entrance</li>
<li>Last Judgment at the exit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Lamentation</em></strong> is the scene when Christ has been taken down from the cross, with followers around him mourning him. It is a group scene of the event, unlike the Pieta, which was just Mary and Christ. A range of emotions are displayed: sadness, resignation, outbursts, and despair.</p>
<p>Here, Mary holds Christ in a manner similar to other Mary and Christ Child scenes or Nativity scenes. She raises her right knee to prop Christ up. She puts her arm around him and leans towards him.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-651 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Jesus.jpg?resize=300%2C245&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="245" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Jesus.jpg?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Jesus.jpg?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The diagonal cliff formation points the eye to the main action placed in the lower-left hand corner. Christ is no longer center, no longer heraldic, no longer hierarchical. This is a departure from Medieval tradition.</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene sits at Christ’s feet, and her long, red curly hair, references how she had earlier cleaned Christ’s feet, with oil and her hair. John the Evangelist stands behind her. He is the youngest disciple and always depicted beardless.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-652 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?resize=300%2C237&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="237" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?resize=300%2C237&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?resize=768%2C606&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/63-Angel.jpg?w=907&amp;ssl=1 907w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The angels are in grief, pulling on their hair. While the figures at the back encircle the action. They do not provide information to the narrative but are a visual to the entrance of the painting.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Typology?</strong></h5>
<p>Typology is the study and interpretation of stories and symbols in the Bible, especially the relationship between  the Old and New Testaments. Here is how this is used in <em>Lamentation</em>.</p>
<p>The land is baren except for a single dead tree. This is the Tree of Life, which withered at the fall of Adam.  Christ is often thought of as the second Adam. This also gives reference to Winter and Christ’s death, before Spring and the eventual resolution.</p>
<p>In the quatrefoil to the left, Jonah is being swallowed by a whale, from the Old Testament story.  Jonah is often seen as a typological precursor to Christ.  He suffered a “death” in the belly of the whale for three days. Then he was spit out. This was seen as a resurrection.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Giotto di Bondone (1276- 1377)</strong> is considered the first artist of the Renaissance because he departs from the Gothic style and begins to place three-dimensional solid figures in a real and logical space. Art historians speculate that he was trained by Florentine painter, Cimabue, because their styles were so similar.</p>
<p>Born just outside of Florence, he would paint chapels in not only Florence, but Assisi, Rome, Padua, and Naples. He is regarded as the most important Italian painter in the 14<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
