<h2><strong>1100–1980 CE</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1403 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1.png?resize=990%2C552&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="552" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1.png?w=1290&amp;ssl=1 1290w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1.png?resize=1024%2C571&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1.png?resize=768%2C428&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Spirits and Ancestors”</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the traditional <strong>African art</strong> focused upon spirits imbedded in nature and ancestor worship.  These beliefs were powerful and motivated artistic production through the desire to positively affect the Africans’ relationship to those spirits or ancestors.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context </strong></h5>
<p>The African continent is vast, complex, and difficult to summarize. The <strong>people worship their ancestors</strong>. The people do not die but can be communicated with. There is also <strong>a great deal of respect for elders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spirit worship</strong> is key. It is thought that spirits can control fertility of both humans and of land.</p>
<p>There is an interpretation of African art, culture, and history as primitive.  This often stemmed from European interpretations that privileged realism and science over stylization and ancestral/shamanistic religions.</p>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Art was not only intended to be decorative but was supposed to serve a ceremonial purpose.</li>
<li>Artists generally used <strong>wood, ivory, and metal</strong>, as these were common natural resources surrounding these African tribes.</li>
<li>Artists worked with workshops and were trained in this manner.</li>
<li>There are often no written histories. African work is not typically signed or dated</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Sculpture</strong></h5>
<p>Sculpture was <strong>made to be portable</strong>. There are no large sculptures. Sometimes these works were multimedia such as jewelry.</p>
<p>The work is often made from wood. Prestigious works were sometimes made of ivory or metal.</p>
<p>Carvings of ancestors and kings are frontal and stiff. Heads are too large for the bodies. Also note the geometrization of forms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1404" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Edo-Bracelet.jpg?resize=808%2C684&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="808" height="684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Edo-Bracelet.jpg?resize=1024%2C867&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Edo-Bracelet.jpg?resize=300%2C254&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Edo-Bracelet.jpg?resize=768%2C650&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Edo-Bracelet.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This work is a <strong>bracelet that is part of the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</strong> It was made between 1550-1680, by the Edo people and part the Nigeria Court of Benin. The jewelry is made with ivory and possibly some copper. Below is the backgrounder the museum gives on the work:</p>
<blockquote><p>At palace festivals, the king and chiefs of Benin wear pairs of long, cylindrical bracelets made of ivory or brass decorated with images that symbolize royal power. On this example, images of mudfish and Portuguese heads&#8211;both referring to the king&#8217;s divine nature and his association with Olokun&#8211;alternate checkerboard style around the bracelet. Bracelets were among the few ivory objects available to chiefs and not strictly monopolized by the king.</p></blockquote>
<h5>Architecture</h5>
<p>Architecture is generally made of <strong>mudbrick, and sometimes stone</strong>. Rain presents challenges and buildings need constant maintenance.</p>
<p>A requirement in African are buildings that remain cool inside. They also must be easy to make and inexpensive.</p>

<p>This is a huge site and complex that includes, <strong>Hill Ruin</strong> (on a rocky hilltop that includes a sacred cave), <strong>Great Enclosure and Valley Ruins</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1406" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/167-layout.png?resize=680%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/167-layout.png?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/167-layout.png?resize=283%2C300&amp;ssl=1 283w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town lay at the bottom of the hill with a royal complex. A total of 18,000 people lived here.</p>
<p>Granite blocks, quarried from surrounding hills, were cut into the same size, and stacked up from the ground. There were no straight lines or right angles. It was entirely built using curves. No mortar was used. Stones were just carefully placed upon other stones.</p>
<p>The walls slope inward at the top, standing 36 feet high and stretching 800 plus feet. A smaller wall parallels the exterior wall creating a tight passageway leading to large towers.</p>

<p>The <strong>conical tower</strong> is shaped like a granary. It represented the power of the king somehow. What was it? A temple?</p>
<p>The circular wall was a <strong>sign of defense</strong>. It also helped to preserve the <strong>privacy</strong> of the royal family and show their <strong>status</strong> by setting them apart from the commoners.</p>
<p>The <strong>walls</strong> don’t seem to be for protection. There are gaps and interrupted patterns. This makes the spaces weak.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Bantu migrations</strong> moved Africans from Western African into the interior. The people brought agriculture with them.</p>
<p>The <strong>Shona peoples</strong> found Great Zimbabwe. They are the largest ethnic group in Zimbabwe. The community was based on farming, livestock, mining, and trade. The ruling elite appear to have controlled wealth through the management of cattle which was the cornerstone of the Zimbabwean economy. By 1500, their influence waned though historians are not sure why.</p>
<blockquote><p>Archaeological evidence has revealed glass beads and porcelain from China and Persia, as well as gold and Arab coins. This illustrates the extent of the long-distance trade that Zimbabwe participated in with the outside world.</p></blockquote>
<p>In  the 1800s, English colonizers found Great Zimbabwe and were stunned by the grandeur and workmanship. It was concluded that Muslims must have constructed this (even though there is no evidence of Muslims in this area). This is a symbol of longstanding prejudices against African culture.</p>

<p><strong>Great Mosque of Djenné </strong>located in <strong>Djenné, Mali, </strong>is one of the largest mud-brick mosques in the world. The African influenced structure uses local material such as mud/ straw bricks (adobe) which is common in West Africa, as well as palm wood. The walls cool down at night and slowly warm up during the day. They help to retain some of the coolness from the evenings</p>
<p><strong>Torons</strong> or timber beams throughout the exterior are both decorative and structural and act as permanent scaffolding for the building.</p>
<h5><strong>An Islamic Influenced Floor plan</strong></h5>
<p>There are huge exterior walls that are between 18 and  24 inches thick. An earthen roof covers the building and is supported with pillars. The roof has several holes covered by terracotta lids  that provide the interior with fresh air.</p>
<p>The vertical buttresses on the exterior helps to funnel rain run-off.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hypostyle hall plan</strong> has a courtyard with hypostyle hall interior.</p>
<p>There are three large towers in the qibla wall (<strong>minarets</strong>). Remember qibla wall overlooks the city marketplace.</p>
<h5><strong>A Maintenance Festival</strong></h5>
<p>This is the site of an annual festival called the Plastering of the Great Mosque (maintenance). The adobe and mud buildings require periodic (and really, annual) re-plastering. If re-plastering does not occur, the structure will slowly melt in the rainy seasons. During the annual festival, the whole town contributes by re-plastering the mosque with a mud plaster made from melted butter and fine clay.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a place of Muslim <strong>worship, prayer, contemplation</strong>, and <strong>community gatherings</strong>. It is the <strong>center of Islamic leaning and pilgrimage in West Africa</strong>. It was constructed by Mansa Musa, the king of the Mali empire who converted to Islam. His point was to show that African Muslims are just as devout as Arab Muslims.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The mosque overlooks the city marketplace which is held on Mondays. This shows us the intersection of commerce and religion. At the top of the three minarets are conical extensions with ostrich eggs placed at the top. This is a symbol of fertility and purity in Mali.</p>

<h5><strong>The Building of the Mosques</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Djenné </strong>l was founded between 800 – 1250 CE. It flourished as a great center of commerce, learning, and Islam.</p>
<p>In 1200 CE the original mosque was constructed by Mansa Musa. He is evidence of the royal cult of the phenomenon of ruling classes in Africa converting to Islam to gain political benefits.</p>
<p>Later the rulers added surrounding towers and a wall around the complex.</p>
<p>In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, the original building fell into disrepair.</p>
<p>Between 1834 – 1836 a second mosque was constructed. The original was demolished because it was in disrepair, but it was also deemed too lavish in its original design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1413" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/168-The-ruiyns-of-the-original-mosque-as-seen-in-a-French-postcard.jpg?resize=689%2C443&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="689" height="443" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/168-The-ruiyns-of-the-original-mosque-as-seen-in-a-French-postcard.jpg?w=689&amp;ssl=1 689w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/168-The-ruiyns-of-the-original-mosque-as-seen-in-a-French-postcard.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In 1907 after the second mosque fell into disrepair again, a third version was made. During the period of French colonialism in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the mosque became a political symbol for residents.</p>
<p>The French postcard above from 1900 illustrates the ruins of the original mosque.</p>

<p>The <strong>heraldic composition</strong> has a central figure and is flanked evenly on both sides. The <strong>hierarchical scale</strong> uses the size of figures to delineates importance.</p>
<p>In this work communicating the of power of the king is more important than achieving an exact likeness. Therefore, it is not a portrait.  The idea of a large, stylized head  comes from a common African cultural belief stating that the head is the seat of intelligence.</p>
<p>The European influence is evident with the <strong>lost-wax casting technique</strong> used to produce this. It is likely a result of trade between the Portuguese and Benin.</p>
<h5><strong>How it was Made</strong></h5>
<p>The first step was to make a malleable version in wax and then cover it in clay. Then, it was fired to harden. As the heat intensified the wax melted out of the clay. Then, hot molten liquid brass was poured into the clay mold.</p>
<p>It is not sculpture- in- the round, so there is no need for a clay interior to hold its shape.</p>
<h5><strong>Why it was Created</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Created to adorn the exterior of the royal palace in Benin City</li>
<li>Ennoble/honor the ruler</li>
<li>Political propaganda to display the power, royalty, and prestige of the ruler</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>The Story in the Art</strong></h5>
<p>This is a generic image of the oba. The king (<strong>oba</strong>) has mounted a horse and is flanked by attendants. He is a warrior chief depicted with distinctive coral-beaded regalia which rulers still wear today. And rulers still use the shield the attendants are holding to protect the ruler’s head from both danger and sun. Only the oba gets this privilege and they always travel with a large cohort of attendants.</p>
<p>Rosette shapes that adorn the background of the plaque were possibly derived from Christian crosses brought by European traders.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Obas were <strong>spiritual leaders</strong> in addition to being <strong>kings/rulers.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is a gold covered stool with gold attachments. The gold symbolizes royalty and prestige.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Story of the Golden Stool</strong></h5>
<p>In the early 1700s, this area in Ghana was politically divided and involved in many wars.</p>
<p>An important king named Osei Tutu received the <strong>Golden Stool</strong> from the gods. It fell from the sky and landed in his lap! This was considered a miracle and interpreted as the gods choosing Osei Tutu to unite all the other kings in the area. He not only replaced all existing chieftains but also eliminated all other objects related to political authority. This stool was the only one.</p>
<p>This created the <strong>Ashanti</strong> nation.</p>
<h5><strong>The Land of Gold</strong></h5>
<p>The Ashanti kingdom in Ghana is an area rich in gold. The textile color gold and gold itself is reserved for royal use. This kingdom headed up the gold trade with Europeans in North Africa.</p>
<h5><strong>The British Invasion</strong></h5>
<p>In 1874, the British destroyed the Ashanti capital in an attempt to colonize the Gold Coast. The British  also wanted possession of the <strong>Golden Stool</strong>. This war was aptly named <strong>the War of the Golden Stool</strong> (1900).</p>
<p>The King was exiled. The king’s mother (Queen Mother) encouraged people to fight against the British. Of course, the stool was hidden, and the British were unable to find it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was a British victory. Ashanti became a colony but was allowed to retain a ceremonial king and the stool came out of hiding.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1417" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Flag_of_Ashanti.svg_-1.png?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="333" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Stools are iconic now in the Ashanti kingdom and even appear on their flag.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ndop</em></strong><em>. </em><strong>(portrait figure) of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul</strong> is made of wood and stands 19 inches tall.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Ndop?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ndops </strong>are stylized and idealized portrait sculptures but not a portrait that captures an exact likeness.  These figures are stylized in the same way. They are made of rounded contours to create a plump body.</p>
<p>The head makes up 1/3 of the body or a proportion of 1:3. They represent the generic body of an ideal ruler. All have the same basic components, but each have an individual motif/emblem. Ndops are <strong>individualized by the object in that appears in front</strong> of the seated king, as <strong>a symbol</strong>. They are all rubbed with oil to polish them and darken the wood color.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Ndop</em></strong><em>. </em><strong>(portrait figure) of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul </strong>represents and honors the spirit of a now-deceased ruler. It recorded the kings’ reign for posterity and serves as a <strong>totem</strong> or contact point with his spirit.</p>
<h5><strong>Content                                              </strong></h5>
<p>The word<strong> Ndop</strong> means “statue”. These are idealized and stylized wooden images of individual Kuba rulers. The ruler sits cross-legged on a raised platform. His face is calm with eyes closed. He is above mortal affairs.</p>
<p>The short sword in <strong>his left hand</strong> has the handle out. This illustrates nonaggression, but he is still strong.</p>
<p>He is <strong>dressed in ornamental regalia</strong> with long plank of a stylized crown. Remember the <strong>head is the seat of intelligence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>King Mishe’s object is a drum</strong> <strong>with a severed hand</strong>. He expanded his empire during his reign through conquest.</p>
<h5><strong>About the King</strong></h5>
<p>Kuba King Mishe miShyaang maMbul was celebrated for his generosity and his popularity. At the height of his reign in 1710, he commissioned a Ndop statue to be used after he died. This is now <strong>the oldest surviving ndop.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>About the People</strong></h5>
<p>Kuba are renowned for a dynamic wooden artistic legacy. Ndops are the most revered of all Kuba art forms.</p>

<p><strong>Power figure <em>(Nkisi n’kondi) </em></strong>is an art object made of <strong>wood and metal</strong> that measures <strong>14 inches tall</strong>. Sculpted from wood, <strong>treated with red clay </strong>or<strong> plant extract, and dressed in knotted fibers and beads, </strong>the works are embellished with a variety of materials, the most important of which is metal protrusions.</p>
<p>The artist was not important. This was viewed more as a practical object when it was created rather than a work of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Totem</strong> is a spiritual object that creates a point of contact. It is a container of power. A specialist would use this work, with one per community. The specialist was also the artist (<strong>ngonga</strong>, pronounced ung-gan-ga)</p>
<p>The specialist used the power figure to help mediate in a social dispute, or aide those concerned with their health.</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure was punctured with<strong> metal pieces</strong></li>
<li>One could also place materials in its stomach.</li>
<li>Before use, people would lick the blades or bleed onto it.</li>
<li>To ensure the power figure understood its task, materials related could be tied to the nails that were driven into the figure.</li>
<li>Spiritual forces were summoned to work on behalf of the person who supplied the nails.</li>
<li>The more deeply inserted, the more serious the offense or problem.</li>
<li>This served as a visual reminder of pacts and appeals as figure’s history is literally on the figure.</li>
<li>The more a power figure was used, the more powerful it became.</li>
<li>The density of nails validated its potency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parties in a dispute could each drive a nail into the work, sealing their agreement
<ul>
<li>If you broke your oath, bad luck would befall you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The power figure could get rid of witches or bad spirits</li>
<li>It could heal the sick</li>
<li>It could increase fertility</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong></h5>
<p>Typically, the power figure was a man, although it could also be a woman or animal. The <strong>figure’s belly</strong> was filled with <strong>bilongo </strong>(medicinal materials), such as herbs, plant matter, bits of animal bone, egg, fur, and seeds.</p>
<p>The <strong>figure’s posture</strong> is leaning-forward and aggressive, with a partially opened mouth. It has a readiness to act or speak on behalf of individuals who call on his assistance. <strong>Hands on the hips</strong> show a sense of immediacy and physical power. The <strong>figure’s feet</strong> are on blocks as an intermediary between heaven and earth.</p>

<h5><strong>The Offerings</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Items were always connected to the desired outcome. </strong>Often substances were related to the dead like dirt from the cemetery for example. This would serve to bring powers of the dead under the control of the specialist.</p>
<p>A person who might wish to be <strong>faster</strong> would take <strong>mouse fur</strong>, revered for speed, and put it inside. <strong>Seeds </strong>were inserted for a <strong>good harvest. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Claws</strong> could incite spirits <strong>to grasp</strong> something. <strong>Stones </strong>could activate spirits to attack. <strong>Stones from an</strong> <strong>ancestor’s grave</strong> could help the relative to <strong>take on attributes</strong> of that ancestor.</p>
<p>A <strong>cowrie shell</strong> would seal the hole and make sure the substances stayed inside.</p>
<h5><strong>The Context</strong></h5>
<p>The Kongo culture believed the <strong>mooya, </strong>or belly was the focal point to the soul. Thus, the belly button is the access point to the soul and to other worlds/realms. This is after all where we are connected to our mothers.</p>
<p>Community believed spirits could collectively help them and had special abilities to see potential enemies or wrongdoers.</p>
<p><strong>Nkisi </strong>comes from the verb “konda” (to hunt). Hunters were the most powerful. Their job was to hunt down wrongdoers. Hunters administer justice appropriate to the transgression. The power figure was an active enforcer just like hunters.</p>
<p>Europeans probably first encountered these during expeditions to the Congo as early as the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Several were confiscated in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by missionaries. Many were destroyed as examples of sorcery. Some were confiscated as objects of fascination and as evidence of Kongo culture.</p>
<p>Many of the Kongo traditions migrated to the Americas and Caribbean, as the Kongo were one of the groups who most often traded in the African slave trade. This largely led to the development of voodoo practices.</p>

<p><strong>Female <em>(Pwo</em>) mask </strong>is constructed from<strong> wood, fiber, pigment, and metal. </strong>This artwork measures<strong>  15 inches tall. </strong>The carver of mask was a man</p>
<p>The mask face is symmetrical with a wide forehead and made from wood. Fiber is used for the hair. Pigment for coloration and metal for earrings. The reddish-brown skin is mix of red clay and oil, while white clay was used for eyes.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>honors mothers</strong> and more broadly, it honors female ancestors and any living women who are young, fertile, or have given birth. The strength women exhibited in childbirth was particularly worthy of honor</p>
<p>These <strong>masks were used in dances</strong>. Interestingly, they mark <strong>initiations for men into adulthood</strong> as a process of maturation. The male dancers wore tight-fitted costume and wooden breasts, not to be transgressive or cross-dressing but to honor the mother.</p>
<p>The outcome of the performance was to <strong>bring to fertility</strong> to a community to honors mothers.</p>
<p>The messages were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Men could not be here without mothers.</li>
<li>This marks the dissolution of the bonds of intimacy between mothers and sons.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the dancer to whom the mask belonged died, the mask was buried with the male dancer. These masks were not gifts to the women! It stayed with the man to honor the mothers in his life</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pwo</strong> meant a woman who had given birth or a mother. It was the image of an ideal beautiful mother and NOT a portrait.</p>
<p>The <strong>pounded dots around the eyes</strong> suggests a typical scarification or tattooing pattern.  Sadness over growing children is represented often by <strong>a single teardrop</strong> on the cheek. <strong>Her hair</strong> and thick, long braid are a sign of fertility.</p>
<p>The eyes are closed. She doesn’t need to talk or impress us. She deserves our respect.</p>
<p>The white clay around her eyes connects her to the spiritual realm. A mother’s sixth sense is received  through giving birth.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Represents a classic Chokwe mask genre</li>
<li>Culture was matrilineal (means lineage/status traces to mother)</li>

<p><strong>Portrait mask <em>(Mblo</em>) </strong>is a<strong> wooden </strong>mask that has been<strong> painted with pigment </strong>and measures<strong> 14 inches tall. </strong>The artist for this mask was  Owie Kimou. Every mask is unique despite following some basic guidelines as is similar to Ndops.</p>
<h5><strong>Characteristics of Portrait Masks</strong></h5>
<p>Portrait masks have oval faces with elongated noses, small open mouths, and downcast eyes with slits. Broad forehead, pronounced eye sockets, column-shaped nose, quiet and peaceful face is also part of the features.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mblo</strong> masks are symbolic portraits to honor a community’s “MVP”. This one was created for Moya Yanso  who was a prestigious dancer. The “portraits” are not supposed to be realistic, rather, they are an artistic double.</p>
<p>These masks appear in a public dance known as the Mblo. The choreography features a succession of dances that increase in complexity. This culminates in a tribute to the community’s MVP. Individual is honored by having a ritual dance performed in their honor.</p>
<p>The person who performs this dance wears the mask. These performers are trained in this type of dance, just as a ballerina would be.</p>
<p>The masks were then given as a gift to that MVP after the ceremony.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>These masks are the artistic double of the honoree. They are an idealized representation and not a portrait.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half slit eyes</strong> suggest modesty</li>
<li><strong>High forehead</strong> suggests wisdom</li>
<li>Heavy incised <strong>lines</strong> around the cheeks and nose suggest age</li>
<li>Triangular patches of <strong>pigment </strong>suggest life</li>
<li>Color in <strong>cheeks</strong> suggests health</li>
<li><strong>Animal horns</strong> on the top of the head indicate characteristics from the animal that they want to associate with</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>There is a rich mask carving tradition in this region. When not in use, these masks were kept out of sight as a sign of humility. Today, indigenous practices are dying out. Since the 1980s the Mblo masquerade performance is no longer practiced.</p>

<p>The older woman on left is the great dancer Moya Yanso, the woman who was being honored. The man holding the mask is her stepson who danced this mask for her.</p>
<p>Her mblo mask was commissioned by her husband Kouame Ziarey. It was common for mask to be commissioned by family.</p>

<p><strong>Bundu mask </strong>is constructed from wood, cloth, and fiber. The mask is worn over the top of the head and the raffia is meant to fall over the face. Men were responsible for making these masks. When a girl became initiated, the village’s master woodcarver created a special mask just for her. The carving was dependent on a dream the carver would have about the occasion.</p>
<p>When the mask was not in use, it remained hidden.</p>
<h5><strong>How the Mask was Used</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>mask was worn by a woman</strong> and the <strong>ceremony was for a woman</strong>.  Each mask was unique to the girl, and this is the only masquerade performance known where women wore the masks. This illustrates the important role of women in the Mende community.</p>
<p>Used to celebrate initiation of young girls into adulthood, the mask was used when girls arrive back in town after seclusion. Mask is worn by both an older woman and the initiates.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Dance</strong></h5>
<p>Women <strong>dance with the mask on</strong>. The dance was taught when girls were in seclusion They practice for hours, and sometimes are even forced to stay awake for 48 dancing. By the end, they have transformed into young women, who are tough in even the harshest of conditions</p>
<p>The dance teaches girls about certain spiritual and cultural beliefs and is performed with raffia costume and music.</p>

<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>The raffia costume represents Sowei, the water spirit. It must disguise the entire body so that a vengeful spirit does not take her. The mask sits on top of the head.  It represents ideal female spirits and qualities. Shaped like the chrysalis of a butterfly, the mask symbolized a young woman entering puberty.  When young girls are in seclusion, they are referred to as chrysalis.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mask in Detail </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>eyes</strong> are downcast and suggests reserve and humility. There are small eye slits to look out of. The <strong>mouth</strong> is small indicating she does not gossip. The <strong>ears</strong> are small too indicating she does not listen to idle gossip. The <strong>forehead </strong>is high to illustrate a sharp mind. <strong>Hair</strong> indicates health and purity, while the <strong>intricate hairstyle</strong> represents a close tie with the women in the community.</p>
<p>The <strong>rings around the neck</strong> have some significance. The prominent rolls at the back of the neck shows that the figure has enough body fat to give birth to healthy children. These rings could also symbolize concentric waves from which the Sowei breaks through the surface.</p>
<p>The <strong>color</strong> black symbolized water, coolness, humanity, mystery.</p>
<h5><strong>In Context</strong></h5>
<p>The Mende People are an ethnic group of mostly agriculturalists. They are divided into two groups of those who have been initiated and those who haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>Initiation rites</strong> for girls in the Sande Society involved being removed from their everyday lives and taken to a secluded place in the forest. The act of going to the jungle symbolized secrecy and fertility. Seclusion could last several weeks to several months</p>
<p>While in the forest, girls were anointed with white clay and animal fat to make themselves dry, pasty, unattractive. Girls were taught how to be good wives and good mothers. They were instructed in domestic skills, sex, farming, dancing, medicine by the women of the Sande Society.</p>
<p>While secluded, <strong>the main ritual girls</strong> underwent is <strong>female genital mutilation </strong>were the labia and clitoris were removed. This was supposed to increase fertility. It was also thought to instill proper sexual behavior which was considered that sex should not be pleasurable for the woman, rather it was a duty. It was thought to make a young woman clean, test her strength and foreshadow the pain of childbirth. It was also considered a bondage experience between the girls, who had all gone through the same pain and healing process.</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony, their white clay is ritually washed off their body. The young women emerge with a new name and new clothing.</p>
<p>The community has been reluctant to share details of ceremony with scholars, particularly Western scholars.</p>

<p><strong>(<em>Lukasa</em> (memory board) </strong>is an additive sculpture with a<strong> wood </strong>backing that is carved, with<strong> beads, </strong>and<strong> metal </strong>attachments. It is designed to be a unique marker.</p>
<h5><strong>How the Memory Board is Used</strong></h5>
<p>It is held in the left hand and used to “read” history with by touching the surface with right finger. Only members of highest scholarly group (Mbudye Society) have the skills and knowledge to read it. Like aNavigation Chart, it is individual to the reader. Each reader makes their own</p>
<p>Used as a mnemonic device (PEMDAS – Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. This in and of itself doesn’t mean anything but it reminds people of the order of operations)</p>
<p>The <strong>three yellow dots</strong> don’t “symbolize” anything, but the combination might trigger something in the reader’s mind to recall a historical fact. Think of it as a “cheat sheet” or a “hard drive” that backs everything up.</p>
<h5><strong>On Closer Reflection</strong></h5>
<p>The back of<strong><em> Lukasa</em> (memory board)</strong> was designed to look like <strong>a crocodile’s back</strong>. This was animal who the people considered was able to live in multiple worlds. It reveals the Luba people’s ability to be adaptable and timeless.</p>
<p>The overall shape is designed to look like <strong>a tortoise</strong> and the head would be screwed on to peg. This create was a symbol of Luba royalty through strength and perseverance.</p>
<p>This presents a concept mnemonic map of Luba history. It’s a cultural story of Luba, chronicling their history, diagram of territories and chiefdoms.</p>
<p>Each memory  board is unique. The beads combine in various ways to make a code.</p>
<p>In general, it is set up like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>One colored bead is an individual</li>
<li>Large beads surrounded by small beads – king and court</li>
<li>Line of beads – journey or migration or expansion</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Mbudye (Mm BOO dee ay) was established in the 1700s to preserve and disseminate Luba knowledge. The council of men and women were charged with sustaining and interpreting the political and historical history of the Luba. The Mbudye is the highest level. To reach this one must pass through many stages of test as they master successive levels of knowledge.</p>
<p>The community is preliterate. As a result, all histories and traditions are oral. To prevent their loss, lukasa boards are used.</p>

<p>The <strong>glass beads and cowrie shells</strong> used to create the designs were acquired through trade and contact with Europeans, generally <strong>in exchange for slaves</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the Bandolier Bag, Europeans believed they were trading cheap glass for slaves and presumed to have the better end of the deal.</p>
<p>The beads were made from Venetian glass.</p>

<p><strong>Reliquary figure <em>(byeri</em>) </strong>is made of<strong> wood </strong>and stands just under 2 feet tall at<strong> 23 inches. </strong>The artists who made these traveled widely all over Cameroon.</p>
<p>The artwork is comprised of very basic shapes including cylinders and circles. The figure has and elongated torso, large, rounded head, closed mouth, and musculature. The face is highly stylized. The figure is not naturalistic, but this is intentionally so. The purpose was to present certain spiritual and abstract ideas.</p>
<p>The oiled wooden surface is rubbed with palm oil to clean it , as well as darken the wood. This creates a rich surface, which was interpreted as evoking a spiritual power.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Reliquary figure <em>(byeri</em>)</strong> sat atop a skull basket (<strong>nsek-bieri</strong>) that contained ancestral bones. As a guardian of ancestral remains it helps to promote ancestor worship in this community. It also protects women and uninitiated men from the relics as they have tremendous power.</p>
<p>Works of this type were brought out to educate young men about their ancestors and explain their lineages. They were displayed only during certain ritual circumstances, unless they are guarding the bones.</p>
<h5><strong>Terminology</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Totem: </strong>able to access ancestral power and protective forces and be an intermediary between the living and the dead</li>
<li><strong>Talisman: </strong>intended to ward off evil with supernatural properties

<p>Communities practiced ancestor worship widely. Contents of the <strong>nsek-bieri</strong> were sacred and incredibly powerful. These were bones of ancestors, along with other potent substances like beads or medicine. Each family maintained their own box.</p>
<p><strong>Nsek-bieris</strong> remain aboveground. As this community was migratory, moving bones was a necessity and it helped communities maintain worship and cohesiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Nsek-bieris</strong> were maintained by elder men in the community</p>
<p>Byeri tradition dates to pre-colonial times, but the French colonial officials banned it in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p><strong>Veranda post of enthroned king and senior wife (Opo Ogoga) </strong>is an object made of wood and pigment standing 5 feet tall.</p>
<p>The work was made by a renowned sculpture from Olowe of Ise.</p>
<p><strong>Veranda post</strong> is vertical sculpture that acts as a column in a palace courtyard or porch.</p>
<p><strong>Caryatid</strong> is a column that is carved in the shape of a female figure</p>
<p><strong>Pride of place</strong> refers to the most significant placement of a figure. In this work it is difficult to determine. Is it the Queen? She is the largest, most prominent, and blue. Or is it the King because he is the furthest forward and central and seated?</p>
<p>The figures are highly stylized, and this is not a portrait of specific rulers.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>one of four sculpted veranda posts</strong> for the palace at Ikere. It was made for <strong>structural support </strong>as well as a <strong>display of power and prestige</strong> of the king and his wife.</p>
<p>Comment on the <strong>strength of the couple’s relationship. </strong>The difficulty in determining pride of place is intentional. They are both important and each one needs the other figure to secure that importance. The queen literally holds up the roof and stands behind her husband, supporting the throne.</p>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content </strong></h5>
<p>In the word Opo Ogoga <strong>ogoga means king.</strong></p>
<p>The Images of generic rulers and <strong>are not portraits</strong>. The Queen’s scale, color and pose underscore her importance as she stands behind his throne. The King is enthroned, wearing a crown with a bird on it, symbolizes female ancestors. The mmall figures at king’s feet represent a junior wife, a flute-playing trickster-god Esu, and a fan bearer.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Yoruba queens had the critical role of placing the crown on the king’s head during coronation</li>
<li>Senior wives were allowed to use their political acumen and spiritual knowledge to assist the king in making decisions regarding the state (remember Yaxchilan and Menkaure)</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>AFRICAN ART</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1100–1980 CE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1192" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/174.-Portrait-Mask.jpg?resize=800%2C1013&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="1013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>TOPIC 6.3 Theories and Interpretations of African Art</strong></h5>
<p>As they have been traditionally collected by outsiders, African art objects that are similar in form are often grouped with works that come from the same place and are produced by a designated ethnic group. The name of the artist and the date of creation may not be known or acknowledged, but such gaps in the record do not necessarily reflect a lack of interest on the part of those who commission, use, and protect art objects. The Africa we know often comes from ideas promulgated by nonAfricans since the 9th century—as though Africa’s history were brought to, rather than originating from Africa.</p>

<p><strong>Conical tower and circular wall of Great Zimbabwe </strong>is made of<strong> coursed granite blocks </strong>and stands in<strong> Southeastern Zimbabwe, in Africa. </strong>The ruins that survive are a four-hour drive south of Harare, the country’s capital.</p>
<p>This is a huge site and complex that includes, <strong>Hill Ruin</strong> (on a rocky hilltop that includes a sacred cave), <strong>Great Enclosure and Valley Ruins</strong>.</p>
<p>The town lay at the bottom of the hill with a royal complex. A total of 18,000 people lived here.</p>
<p>Granite blocks, quarried from surrounding hills, were cut into the same size, and stacked up from the ground. There were no straight lines or right angles. It was entirely built using curves. No mortar was used. Stones were just carefully placed upon other stones.</p>
<p>The walls slope inward at the top, standing 36 feet high and stretching 800 plus feet. A smaller wall parallels the exterior wall creating a tight passageway leading to large towers.</p>
<p>This is the largest ancient structure south of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>City state</li>
<li>Built as a royal residence for the king</li>
<li>It may have also been a space for religious rituals</li>
<li>Display of power and status, as the size and immensity make clear it a great ruler lived here.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This was a <strong>prosperous trading center and royal complex. </strong>The site had temples, places for rituals, cemeteries, homes, fields, and a marketplace.</p>
<p>The <strong>conical tower</strong> is shaped like a granary. It represented the power of the king somehow. What was it? A temple?</p>
<p>The circular wall was a <strong>sign of defense</strong>. It also helped to preserve the <strong>privacy</strong> of the royal family and show their <strong>status</strong> by setting them apart from the commoners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>walls</strong> don’t seem to be for protection. There are gaps and interrupted patterns. This makes the spaces weak.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Bantu migrations</strong> moved Africans from Western African into the interior. The people brought agriculture with them.</p>
<p>The <strong>Shona peoples</strong> found Great Zimbabwe. They are the largest ethnic group in Zimbabwe. The community was based on farming, livestock, mining, and trade. The ruling elite appear to have controlled wealth through the management of cattle which was the cornerstone of the Zimbabwean economy. By 1500, their influence waned though historians are not sure why.</p>
<p><strong>Archaeological evidence</strong> has revealed glass beads and porcelain from China and Persia, as well as gold and Arab coins. This illustrates the extent of the long-distance trade that Zimbabwe participated in with the outside world.</p>
<p>In  the 1800s, English colonizers found Great Zimbabwe and were stunned by the grandeur and workmanship. It was concluded that Muslims must have constructed this (even though there is no evidence of Muslims in this area). This is a symbol of longstanding prejudices against African cultures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>African Art </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>1100–1980 CE</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1192" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/174.-Portrait-Mask.jpg?resize=800%2C1013&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="1013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>TOPIC 6.2 Purpose and Audience in African Art</strong></h4>
<p>Human beliefs and interactions in Africa are instigated by the arts. African arts are active. They motivate behavior, contain and express belief, and validate social organization and human relations.</p>
<p>Use and efficacy are central to the art of Africa. African arts, though often characterized, collected, and exhibited as figural sculptures and masks, are by nature meant to be performed rather than simply viewed.</p>
<p>African arts are often described in terms of the contexts and functions with which they appear to be associated.</p>
<h5><strong>Daily Use and Ritual Art</strong></h5>
<p>Art is created for both <strong>daily use</strong> and <strong>ritual purposes</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Religious beliefs</li>
<li>Diagnosis and divination</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Personal adornment</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Creative Purpose</strong></h5>
<p>Art forms may be prescribed by a diviner, commissioned by a supplicant, and produced by a specific artist. The art object comes under the custodianship of the person who commissioned it or a member of his or her family.</p>
<p><strong>Performances of objects</strong> are accompanied by costumes and music. None of these practices is simple or random. Cultural protocols acknowledge and ensure the efficacy and appropriateness of artistic experience in Africa.</p>
<p>The arts of <strong>authority</strong>, both achieved, and inherited status and roles legitimate <strong>traditional leadership</strong>. Leaders’ histories and accomplishments are often entrusted to and lauded by historians, bards, and elders.</p>
<p><strong>Personal identity</strong>, <strong>social status</strong>, and <strong>relationships</strong> are delineated by aesthetic choices and artistic expression. Common ancestors link leaders, sanction social behavior and choices, and define the order of social life.</p>
<p>Education, incorporation into adulthood, and civic responsibility are processes marked by the creation, manipulation, and interpretation of art objects.</p>
<p><strong>African histories</strong>, often sung or recited, are traditionally the responsibility of specialists. African art is sung, danced, and presented in holistic experiences for designated audiences; it is created for specific reasons and to produce expected results.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> African “MVP” mask</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Portrait<br />

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Private collection</p>
<p><strong>Portrait mask <em>(Mblo</em>) </strong>is a <strong>wooden </strong>mask that has been<strong> painted with pigment </strong>and measures<strong> 14 inches tall. </strong>The artist for this mask was  Owie Kimou. Every mask is unique despite following some basic guidelines as is similar to Ndops.</p>
<h5><strong>Characteristics of Portrait Masks</strong></h5>
<p>Portrait masks have oval faces with elongated noses, small open mouths, and downcast eyes with slits. Broad forehead, pronounced eye sockets, column-shaped nose, quiet and peaceful face is also part of the features.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mblo</strong> masks are symbolic portraits to honor a community’s “MVP”. This one was created for Moya Yanso  who was a prestigious dancer. The “portraits” are not supposed to be realistic, rather, they are an artistic double.</p>
<p>These masks appear in a public dance known as the Mblo. The choreography features a succession of dances that increase in complexity. This culminates in a tribute to the community’s MVP. Individual is honored by having a ritual dance performed in their honor.</p>
<p>The person who performs this dance wears the mask. These performers are trained in this type of dance, just as a ballerina would be.</p>
<p>The masks were then given as a gift to that MVP after the ceremony.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>These masks are the artistic double of the honoree. They are an idealized representation and not a portrait.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half slit eyes</strong> suggest modesty</li>
<li><strong>High forehead</strong> suggests wisdom</li>
<li>Heavy incised <strong>lines</strong> around the cheeks and nose suggest age</li>
<li>Triangular patches of <strong>pigment </strong>suggest life</li>
<li>Color in <strong>cheeks</strong> suggests health</li>
<li><strong>Animal horns</strong> on the top of the head indicate characteristics from the animal that they want to associate with</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>There is a rich mask carving tradition in this region. When not in use, these masks were kept out of sight as a sign of humility. Today, indigenous practices are dying out. Since the 1980s the Mblo masquerade performance is no longer practiced.</p>

<p>The older woman on left is the great dancer Moya Yanso, the woman who was being honored. The man holding the mask is her stepson who danced this mask for her.</p>
<p>Her mblo mask was commissioned by her husband Kouame Ziarey. It was common for mask to be commissioned by family.</p>

Sexuality<br />
Fertility</p>
<p><strong>Bundu mask </strong>is constructed from wood, cloth, and fiber. The mask is worn over the top of the head and the raffia is meant to fall over the face. Men were responsible for making these masks. When a girl became initiated, the village’s master woodcarver created a special mask just for her. The carving was dependent on a dream the carver would have about the occasion.</p>
<p>When the mask was not in use, it remained hidden.</p>
<h5><strong>How the Mask was Used</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>mask was worn by a woman</strong> and the <strong>ceremony was for a woman</strong>.  Each mask was unique to the girl, and this is the only masquerade performance known where women wore the masks. This illustrates the important role of women in the Mende community.</p>
<p>Used to celebrate initiation of young girls into adulthood, the mask was used when girls arrive back in town after seclusion. Mask is worn by both an older woman and the initiates.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Dance</strong></h5>
<p>Women <strong>dance with the mask on</strong>. The dance was taught when girls were in seclusion They practice for hours, and sometimes are even forced to stay awake for 48 dancing. By the end, they have transformed into young women, who are tough in even the harshest of conditions</p>
<p>The dance teaches girls about certain spiritual and cultural beliefs and is performed with raffia costume and music.</p>

<h5><strong>The Background Story</strong></h5>
<p>The raffia costume represents Sowei, the water spirit. It must disguise the entire body so that a vengeful spirit does not take her. The mask sits on top of the head.  It represents ideal female spirits and qualities. Shaped like the chrysalis of a butterfly, the mask symbolized a young woman entering puberty.  When young girls are in seclusion, they are referred to as chrysalis.</p>
<h5><strong>The Mask in Detail </strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>eyes</strong> are downcast and suggests reserve and humility. There are small eye slits to look out of. The <strong>mouth</strong> is small indicating she does not gossip. The <strong>ears</strong> are small too indicating she does not listen to idle gossip. The <strong>forehead </strong>is high to illustrate a sharp mind. <strong>Hair</strong> indicates health and purity, while the <strong>intricate hairstyle</strong> represents a close tie with the women in the community.</p>
<p>The <strong>rings around the neck</strong> have some significance. The prominent rolls at the back of the neck shows that the figure has enough body fat to give birth to healthy children. These rings could also symbolize concentric waves from which the Sowei breaks through the surface.</p>
<p>The <strong>color</strong> black symbolized water, coolness, humanity, mystery.</p>
<h5><strong>In Context</strong></h5>
<p>The Mende People are an ethnic group of mostly agriculturalists. They are divided into two groups of those who have been initiated and those who haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>Initiation rites</strong> for girls in the Sande Society involved being removed from their everyday lives and taken to a secluded place in the forest. The act of going to the jungle symbolized secrecy and fertility. Seclusion could last several weeks to several months</p>
<p>While in the forest, girls were anointed with white clay and animal fat to make themselves dry, pasty, unattractive. Girls were taught how to be good wives and good mothers. They were instructed in domestic skills, sex, farming, dancing, medicine by the women of the Sande Society.</p>
<p>While secluded, <strong>the main ritual girls</strong> underwent is <strong>female genital mutilation </strong>were the labia and clitoris were removed. This was supposed to increase fertility. It was also thought to instill proper sexual behavior which was considered that sex should not be pleasurable for the woman, rather it was a duty. It was thought to make a young woman clean, test her strength and foreshadow the pain of childbirth. It was also considered a bondage experience between the girls, who had all gone through the same pain and healing process.</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony, their white clay is ritually washed off their body. The young women emerge with a new name and new clothing.</p>
<p>The community has been reluctant to share details of ceremony with scholars, particularly Western scholars.</p>

<p><strong>(<em>Lukasa</em> (memory board) </strong>is an additive sculpture with a<strong> wood </strong>backing that is carved, with<strong> beads, </strong>and<strong> metal </strong>attachments. It is designed to be a unique marker.</p>
<h5><strong>How the Memory Board is Used</strong></h5>
<p>It is held in the left hand and used to “read” history with by touching the surface with right finger. Only members of highest scholarly group (Mbudye Society) have the skills and knowledge to read it. Like aNavigation Chart, it is individual to the reader. Each reader makes their own</p>
<p>Used as a mnemonic device (PEMDAS – Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. This in and of itself doesn’t mean anything but it reminds people of the order of operations)</p>
<p>The <strong>three yellow dots</strong> don’t “symbolize” anything, but the combination might trigger something in the reader’s mind to recall a historical fact. Think of it as a “cheat sheet” or a “hard drive” that backs everything up.</p>

<h5><strong>On Closer Reflection</strong></h5>
<p>The back of<strong><em> Lukasa</em> (memory board)</strong> was designed to look like <strong>a crocodile’s back</strong>. This was animal who the people considered was able to live in multiple worlds. It reveals the Luba people’s ability to be adaptable and timeless.</p>
<p>The overall shape is designed to look like <strong>a tortoise</strong> and the head would be screwed on to peg. This create was a symbol of Luba royalty through strength and perseverance.</p>
<p>This presents a concept mnemonic map of Luba history. It’s a cultural story of Luba, chronicling their history, diagram of territories and chiefdoms.</p>
<p>Each memory  board is unique. The beads combine in various ways to make a code.</p>
<p>In general, it is set up like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>One colored bead is an individual</li>
<li>Large beads surrounded by small beads – king and court</li>
<li>Line of beads – journey or migration or expansion</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Mbudye (Mm BOO dee ay) was established in the 1700s to preserve and disseminate Luba knowledge. The council of men and women were charged with sustaining and interpreting the political and historical history of the Luba. The Mbudye is the highest level. To reach this one must pass through many stages of test as they master successive levels of knowledge.</p>
<p>The community is preliterate. As a result, all histories and traditions are oral. To prevent their loss, lukasa boards are used.</p>

<p><strong>Reliquary figure <em>(byeri</em>) </strong>is made of<strong> wood </strong>and stands just under 2 feet tall at<strong> 23 inches. </strong>The artists who made these traveled widely all over Cameroon.</p>
<p>The artwork is comprised of very basic shapes including cylinders and circles. The figure has and elongated torso, large, rounded head, closed mouth, and musculature. The face is highly stylized. The figure is not naturalistic, but this is intentionally so. The purpose was to present certain spiritual and abstract ideas.</p>
<p>The oiled wooden surface is rubbed with palm oil to clean it , as well as darken the wood. This creates a rich surface, which was interpreted as evoking a spiritual power.</p>
<h5><strong>The Purpose</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Reliquary figure <em>(byeri</em>)</strong> sat atop a skull basket (<strong>nsek-bieri</strong>) that contained ancestral bones. As a guardian of ancestral remains it helps to promote ancestor worship in this community. It also protects women and uninitiated men from the relics as they have tremendous power.</p>
<p>Works of this type were brought out to educate young men about their ancestors and explain their lineages. They were displayed only during certain ritual circumstances, unless they are guarding the bones.</p>
<h5><strong>Terminology</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Totem: </strong>able to access ancestral power and protective forces and be an intermediary between the living and the dead</li>
<li><strong>Talisman: </strong>intended to ward off evil with supernatural properties
<ul>
<li>Therefore, his pose is seated and protective</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The figurine is a male ancestral guardian figure</li>
<li>He could balance opposites / encapsulates dualities
<ul>
<li>Bring together the living and the dead</li>
<li>Sense of calm (expressionless) vs. sense of power (coiled up energy and vitality)</li>
<li>Image of child (oversized head, short arms, and legs) vs. image of adult (muscular)</li>
<li>Belly button: able to move from one realm to the next (just as an umbilical cord connects a fetus to its mother’s womb through the belly button)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p>Communities practiced ancestor worship widely. Contents of the <strong>nsek-bieri</strong> were sacred and incredibly powerful. These were bones of ancestors, along with other potent substances like beads or medicine. Each family maintained their own box.</p>
<p><strong>Nsek-bieris</strong> remain aboveground. As this community was migratory, moving bones was a necessity and it helped communities maintain worship and cohesiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Nsek-bieris</strong> were maintained by elder men in the community</p>
<p>Byeri tradition dates to pre-colonial times, but the French colonial officials banned it in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>AFRICAN ART</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1100–1980 CE</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1192" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/174.-Portrait-Mask.jpg?resize=800%2C1013&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="1013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>6.1 Cultural Contexts of African Art </strong></h5>
<p>Art in Africa is a combination of objects, acts, and events, created in a wide variety of media, including vocal, aural, and visual. Materials include <strong>wood, ivory, metals, ceramic, fiber</strong>, and <strong>elements of nature</strong>. These are carved, cast, forged, modeled, woven, and combined by recognized specialists, often for knowledgeable patrons.</p>
<h5><strong>In the Beginning</strong></h5>
<p>Human life, which is understood to have begun in Africa, developed over millions of years, and radiated beyond the continent of Africa. The earliest African art dates to 77,000 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Early artistic expression</strong> on the African continent is found in the <strong>rock art</strong> of the Sahara and in southern Africa. Those works <strong>depict animals</strong> that lived in each region, as well as <strong>human pursuits</strong> such as herding, combat, dance, and contact among different groups of people. It also illustrates the use of <strong>technologies</strong> of the time such as <strong>horses and chariots</strong>.</p>
<p>The now-deserts of the Sahara were once grasslands and an original source of agriculture and animal husbandry. As the desert grew, it stretched toward the still well-watered valley of the Nile and the culture of pharaonic Egypt.</p>
<h5><strong>Art and Belief Systems</strong></h5>
<p>Art reveals belief systems. It presents a world that is known but not necessarily seen, predictable, or even available to everyone. These arts are expressive rather than representational and often require specialized or supernaturally ordained capabilities for their creation, use, and interpretation.</p>
<p>African art is concentrated on <strong>ideas regarding beliefs and relationships that exist in the social and intellectual world.</strong> It is not concerned with objects of the natural or physical world.</p>
<p>As in all arts, <strong>aspects of human experience</strong> such as origins, destinies, beliefs, physicality, power, and gender are expressed through objects and performances.</p>
<h5><strong>An Expression of Social Life</strong></h5>
<p>Artistic expression in Africa is an <strong>integral part of social life</strong>. It connects daily practices to beliefs, systems of power and authority, and social networks that link people to their families, communities, and shared ancestors. African arts mark <strong>status, identity</strong>, and <strong>cycles of human experience</strong> like <strong>maturational,</strong> <strong>seasonal, astronomical,</strong> and <strong>liturgical</strong>.</p>
<p>Urbanization and its monumental trappings, both bureaucratic and architectural are often associated with “civilization”. This takes many forms in Africa. <strong>Administrative and liturgical centers exist apart from settlement</strong> that is often determined by the spaces required for agriculture or herding<strong>. Seasonal climatic shifts</strong> and demands of political relations affect the scale and distribution of built environments and arts that mark them. The sites of Meroë, Timbuktu, Zimbabwe, Igbo Ukwu, and Kilwa Kisiwani demonstrate that range of monumentalities.</p>
<h5><strong>Migration</strong></h5>
<p>Human migrations carried populations southward into central Africa and eventually across the Congo River Basin. The arts, major world religions, and international trade routes followed those paths and flourished in patterns of distribution seen in Africa today.</p>
<p>Outsiders have often characterized, collected, and exhibited African arts as primitive, ethnographic, anonymous, and static. In reality Africa’s interaction with the rest of the world led to dynamic intellectual and artistic traditions that sustain hundreds of cultures and almost as many languages. This has contributed dramatically to the corpus of human expression. African life and arts have been deeply affected by ongoing, cosmopolitan patterns of interaction with populations around the world and through time.</p>
<h5><strong>Creative Contribution</strong></h5>
<p>Creative contributions of African life and arts are found in populations around the world. Artistic practices were conveyed by and continue to be serviced by African people and beliefs, from Macao to Manaus to Mauritania. These creative contributions are reflected in diverse art forms, from the practices of Santeria to Japanese screens and the paintings of Renaissance Venice. The literatures of Negritude and the Harlem.</p>
<p>Renaissance expanded the notions of place and race to new levels that are again changing in the contemporary diaspora. Although traditional African art forms are usually described and exhibited, contemporary African arts have increased awareness and understanding of the arts of the continent across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Great Mosque of Djenné </strong>located in <strong>Djenné, Mali, </strong>is one of the largest mud-brick mosques in the world. The African influenced structure uses local material such as mud/ straw bricks (adobe) which is common in West Africa, as well as palm wood. The walls cool down at night and slowly warm up during the day. They help to retain some of the coolness from the evenings</p>
<p><strong>Torons</strong> or timber beams throughout the exterior are both decorative and structural and act as permanent scaffolding for the building.</p>
<h5><strong>An Islamic Influenced Floor Plan</strong></h5>
<p>There are huge exterior walls that are between 18 and  24 inches thick. An earthen roof covers the building and is supported with pillars. The roof has several holes covered by terracotta lids  that provide the interior with fresh air.</p>
<p>The vertical buttresses on the exterior helps to funnel rain run-off.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hypostyle hall plan</strong> has a courtyard with hypostyle hall interior.</p>
<p>There are three large towers in the qibla wall (<strong>minarets</strong>). Remember qibla wall overlooks the city marketplace.</p>

<h5><strong>A Maintenance Festival</strong></h5>
<p>This is the site of an annual festival called the Plastering of the Great Mosque (maintenance). The adobe and mud buildings require periodic (and really, annual) re-plastering. If re-plastering does not occur, the structure will slowly melt in the rainy seasons. During the annual festival, the whole town contributes by re-plastering the mosque with a mud plaster made from melted butter and fine clay.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a place of Muslim <strong>worship, prayer, contemplation</strong>, and <strong>community gatherings</strong>. It is the <strong>center of Islamic leaning and pilgrimage in West Africa</strong>. It was constructed by Mansa Musa, the king of the Mali empire who converted to Islam. His point was to show that African Muslims are just as devout as Arab Muslims.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The mosque overlooks the city marketplace which is held on Mondays. This shows us the intersection of commerce and religion. At the top of the three minarets are conical extensions with ostrich eggs placed at the top. This is a symbol of fertility and purity in Mali.</p>
<h5><strong>The Building of the Mosques</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Djenné </strong>l was founded between 800 – 1250 CE. It flourished as a great center of commerce, learning, and Islam.</p>
<p>In 1200 CE the original mosque was constructed by Mansa Musa. He is evidence of the royal cult of the phenomenon of ruling classes in Africa converting to Islam to gain political benefits.</p>
<p>Later the rulers added surrounding towers and a wall around the complex.</p>
<p>In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, the original building fell into disrepair.</p>
<p>Between 1834 – 1836 a second mosque was constructed. The original was demolished because it was in disrepair, but it was also deemed too lavish in its original design.</p>
<p>In 1907 after the second mosque fell into disrepair again, a third version was made. During the period of French colonialism in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the mosque became a political symbol for residents.</p>

<p><strong>Wall plaque from Oba’s Palace </strong>is made from<strong> cast brass </strong>and measures<strong> 20 by 16 inches. </strong>The work crafted in <strong>high relief</strong> was one of 900 brass panels in total, which were nailed to wooden pillars.</p>
<p>The <strong>heraldic composition</strong> has a central figure and is flanked evenly on both sides. The <strong>hierarchical scale</strong> uses the size of figures to delineates importance.</p>
<p>In this work communicating the of power of the king is more important than achieving an exact likeness. Therefore, it is not a portrait.  The idea of a large, stylized head  comes from a common African cultural belief stating that the head is the seat of intelligence.</p>
<p>The European influence is evident with the <strong>lost-wax casting technique</strong> used to produce this. It is likely a result of trade between the Portuguese and Benin.</p>
<h5><strong>How it was Made</strong></h5>
<p>The first step was to make a malleable version in wax and then cover it in clay. Then, it was fired to harden. As the heat intensified the wax melted out of the clay. Then, hot molten liquid brass was poured into the clay mold.</p>
<p>It is not sculpture- in- the round, so there is no need for a clay interior to hold its shape.</p>
<h5><strong>Why it was Created</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Created to adorn the exterior of the royal palace in Benin City</li>
<li>Ennoble/honor the ruler</li>
<li>Political propaganda to display the power, royalty, and prestige of the ruler</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story in the Art</strong></h5>
<p>This is a generic image of the oba. The king (<strong>oba</strong>) has mounted a horse and is flanked by attendants. He is a warrior chief depicted with distinctive coral-beaded regalia which rulers still wear today. And rulers still use the shield the attendants are holding to protect the ruler’s head from both danger and sun. Only the oba gets this privilege and they always travel with a large cohort of attendants.</p>
<p>Rosette shapes that adorn the background of the plaque were possibly derived from Christian crosses brought by European traders.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Obas were <strong>spiritual leaders</strong> in addition to being <strong>kings/rulers.</strong></p>
<p>The Benin Empire was known for its brass works. Trade was high between the Benin and Portuguese from the 16<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup> centuries. This led to cultural diffusion through the <strong>lost-wax technique</strong> and <strong>Christianity.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is a gold covered stool with gold attachments. The gold symbolizes royalty and prestige <strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>The Story of the Golden Stool</strong></h5>
<p>In the early 1700s, this area in Ghana was politically divided and involved in many wars.</p>
<p>An important king named Osei Tutu received the <strong>Golden Stool</strong> from the gods. It fell from the sky and landed in his lap! This was considered a miracle and interpreted as the gods choosing Osei Tutu to unite all the other kings in the area. He not only replaced all existing chieftains but also eliminated all other objects related to political authority. This stool was the only one.</p>
<p>This created the <strong>Ashanti</strong> nation.</p>
<h5><strong>The Land of Gold</strong></h5>
<p>The Ashanti kingdom in Ghana is an area rich in gold. The textile color gold and gold itself is reserved for royal use. This kingdom headed up the gold trade with Europeans in North Africa.</p>
<h5><strong>The British Invasion</strong></h5>
<p>In 1874, the British destroyed the Ashanti capital in an attempt to colonize the Gold Coast. The British  also wanted possession of the <strong>Golden Stool</strong>. This war was aptly named <strong>the War of the Golden Stool</strong> (1900).</p>
<p>The King was exiled. The king’s mother (Queen Mother) encouraged people to fight against the British. Of course, the stool was hidden, and the British were unable to find it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was a British victory. Ashanti became a colony but was allowed to retain a ceremonial king and the stool came out of hiding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ndop</em></strong><em>. </em><strong>(portrait figure) of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul</strong> is made of wood and stands 19 inches tall.</p>
<h5><strong>What is a Ndop?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Ndops </strong>are stylized and idealized portrait sculptures but not a portrait that captures an exact likeness.  These figures are stylized in the same way. They are made of rounded contours to create a plump body.</p>
<p>The head makes up 1/3 of the body or a proportion of 1:3. They represent the generic body of an ideal ruler. All have the same basic components, but each have an individual motif/emblem. Ndops are <strong>individualized by the object in that appears in front</strong> of the seated king, as <strong>a symbol</strong>. They are all rubbed with oil to polish them and darken the wood color.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Ndop</em></strong><em>. </em><strong>(portrait figure) of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul </strong>represents and honors the spirit of a now-deceased ruler. It recorded the kings’ reign for posterity and serves as a <strong>totem</strong> or contact point with his spirit.</p>
<h5><strong>Content                                              </strong></h5>
<p>The word<strong> Ndop</strong> means “statue”; these are idealized and stylized wooden images of individual Kuba rulers. The ruler sits cross-legged on a raised platform. His face is calm with eyes closed. He is above mortal affairs.</p>
<p>The short sword in <strong>his left hand</strong> has the handle out. This illustrates nonaggression, but he is still strong.</p>
<p>He is <strong>dressed in ornamental regalia</strong> with long plank of a stylized crown. Remember the <strong>head is the seat of intelligence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>King Mishe’s object is a drum</strong> <strong>with a severed hand</strong>. He expanded his empire during his reign through conquest.</p>
<h5><strong>The King and the People</strong></h5>
<p>Kuba King Mishe miShyaang maMbul was celebrated for his generosity and his popularity. At the height of his reign in 1710, he commissioned a Ndop statue to be used after he died. This is now <strong>the oldest surviving ndop.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Power figure <em>(Nkisi n’kondi) </em></strong>is an art object made of <strong>wood and metal</strong> that measures <strong>14 inches tall</strong>. Sculpted from <strong>wood,</strong> <strong>treated with red clay </strong>or<strong> plant extract, and dressed in knotted fibers and beads, </strong>the work is embellished with a variety of materials, the most important of which is <strong>metal protrusions.</strong></p>
<p>The artist was not important. This was viewed more as a practical object when it was created rather than a work of art.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Totem</strong> is a spiritual object that creates a point of contact. It is a container of power. A specialist, who was one chosen member of the community would use this work. The specialist was also the artist (<strong>ngonga</strong>, pronounced ung-gan-ga)</p>
<p>The specialist used the power figure to help mediate in a social dispute, or aide those concerned with their health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure was punctured with<strong> metal pieces</strong></li>
<li>One could also place materials in its stomach.</li>
<li>Before use, people would lick the blades or bleed onto it.</li>
<li>To ensure the power figure understood its task, materials related could be tied to the nails that were driven into the figure.</li>
<li>Spiritual forces were summoned to work on behalf of the person who supplied the nails.</li>
<li>The more deeply inserted, the more serious the offense or problem.</li>
<li>This served as a visual reminder of pacts and appeals as the figure’s history is literally on the figure.</li>
<li>The more a power figure was used, the more powerful it became.</li>
<li>The density of nails validated its potency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parties in a dispute could each drive a nail into the work, sealing their agreement
<ul>
<li>If you broke your oath, bad luck would befall you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The power figure could get rid of witches or bad spirits</li>
<li>It could heal the sick</li>
<li>It could increase fertility</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong></h5>
<p>Typically, the power figure was a man, although it could also be a woman or animal. The <strong>figure’s belly</strong> was filled with <strong>bilongo </strong>(medicinal materials), such as herbs, plant matter, bits of animal bone, egg, fur, and seeds.</p>
<p>The <strong>figure’s posture</strong> is leaning-forward and aggressive, with a partially opened mouth. It has a readiness to act or speak on behalf of individuals who call on his assistance. <strong>Hands on the hips</strong> show a sense of immediacy and physical power. The <strong>figure’s feet</strong> are on blocks as an intermediary between heaven and earth.</p>
<h5><strong>The Offerings</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Items were always connected to the desired outcome. </strong>Often substances were related to the dead like dirt from the cemetery for example. This would serve to bring powers of the dead under the control of the specialist.</p>
<p>A person who might wish to be <strong>faster</strong> would take <strong>mouse fur</strong>, revered for speed, and put it inside. <strong>Seeds </strong>were inserted for a <strong>good harvest. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Claws</strong> could incite spirits <strong>to grasp</strong> something. <strong>Stones </strong>could activate spirits to attack. <strong>Stones from an</strong> <strong>ancestor’s grave</strong> could help the relative to <strong>take on attributes</strong> of that ancestor.</p>
<p>A <strong>cowrie shell</strong> would seal the hole and make sure the substances stayed inside.</p>
<h5><strong>The Context</strong></h5>
<p>The Kongo culture believed the <strong>mooya, </strong>or belly was the focal point to the soul. Thus, the belly button is the access point to the soul and to other worlds/realms. This is after all where we are connected to our mothers.</p>
<p>Community believed spirits could collectively help them and had special abilities to see potential enemies or wrongdoers.</p>
<p><strong>Nkisi </strong>comes from the verb “konda” (to hunt). Hunters were the most powerful. Their job was to hunt down wrongdoers. Hunters administer justice appropriate to the transgression. The power figure was an active enforcer just like hunters.</p>
<p>Europeans probably first encountered these during expeditions to the Congo as early as the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Several were confiscated in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by missionaries. Many were destroyed as examples of sorcery. Some were confiscated as objects of fascination and as evidence of the Kongo culture.</p>
<p><strong>Many of the Kongo traditions migrated to the Americas and Caribbean</strong>, as the Kongo were one of the groups who most often traded in the African slave trade. <strong>This largely led to the development of voodoo practices.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Female <em>(Pwo</em>) mask </strong>is constructed from<strong> wood, fiber, pigment, and metal. </strong>This artwork measures<strong>  15 inches tall. </strong>The carver of the mask was a man</p>
<p><strong>The mask face is symmetrical</strong> with a wide forehead. Made from wood, fiber is used for the hair. Pigment is used for coloration and metal for earrings. The reddish-brown skin is mix of red clay and oil, while white clay was used for eyes.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>honors mothers. </strong>More broadly, it honors female ancestors and any living women who are young, fertile, or have given birth. The strength women exhibited in childbirth was particularly worthy of honor.</p>
<p>These <strong>masks were used in dances</strong>. Interestingly, they mark <strong>initiations for men into adulthood</strong> as a process of maturation. The male dancers wore tight-fitted costume and wooden breasts, not to be transgressive or cross-dressing, but to honor the mother.</p>
<p>The outcome of the performance was to <strong>bring to fertility</strong> to a community to honors mothers.</p>
<p>The messages were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Men could not be here without mothers.</li>
<li>This marks the dissolution of the bonds of intimacy between mothers and sons.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the dancer to whom the mask belonged died, the mask was buried with the male dancer. These masks were not gifts to the women! It stayed with the man to honor the mothers in his life.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pwo</strong> meant a woman who had given birth or a mother. It was the image of an ideal beautiful mother and NOT a portrait.</p>
<p>The <strong>pounded dots around the eyes</strong> suggests a typical scarification or tattooing pattern.  Sadness over growing children is represented often by <strong>a single teardrop</strong> on the cheek. <strong>Her hair</strong> is a thick, long braid. This is a sign of fertility.</p>
<p>The<strong> eyes</strong> are closed. She doesn’t need to talk or impress us. She deserves our respect.</p>
<p>The white clay around her eyes connects her to the spiritual realm. A mother’s sixth sense is received  through giving birth.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Represents a classic Chokwe mask genre</li>
<li>Culture was matrilineal (means lineage/status traces to mother)</li>

<p><strong>Veranda post of enthroned king and senior wife (Opo Ogoga) </strong>is an object made of wood <strong>and pigment standing 5 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p>The work was made by a renowned sculpture from Olowe of Ise.</p>
<p><strong>Veranda post</strong> is vertical sculpture that acts as a column in a palace courtyard or porch.</p>
<p><strong>Caryatid</strong> is a column that is carved in the shape of a female figure.</p>
<p><strong>Pride of place</strong> refers to the most significant placement of a figure. In this work it is difficult to determine. Is it the Queen? She is the largest, most prominent, and blue. Or is it the King because he is the furthest forward and central and seated?</p>
<p>The figures are highly stylized, and this is not a portrait of specific rulers</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>one of four sculpted veranda posts</strong> for the palace at Ikere. It was made for <strong>structural support </strong>as well as a <strong>display of power and prestige</strong> of the king and his wife.</p>
<p>This is a comment on the <strong>strength of the couple’s relationship. </strong>The difficulty in determining pride of place is intentional. They are both important and each one needs the other figure to secure that importance. The queen literally holds up the roof and stands behind her husband, supporting the throne</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content </strong></h5>
<p>In the word Opo Ogoga <strong>ogoga means king.</strong></p>
<p>The Images of generic rulers and <strong>are not portraits</strong>. The Queen’s scale, color and pose underscore her importance as she stands behind his throne. The King is enthroned, wearing a crown with a bird on it, symbolizeing female ancestors. The small figures at king’s feet represent a junior wife, a flute-playing trickster-god Esu, and a fan bearer.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Yoruba queens had the critical role of placing the crown on the king’s head during coronation</li>
<li>Senior wives were allowed to use their political acumen and spiritual knowledge to assist the king in making decisions regarding the state (remember Yaxchilan and Menkaure)</li>
