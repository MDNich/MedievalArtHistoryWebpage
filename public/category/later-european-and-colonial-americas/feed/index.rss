<h5><strong>Theme: “Pluralism”</strong></h5>
<p>Multiple styles existed at once, and many artists participated in more than one style.  Most artists do not fit neatly into any given “category” or “style.” Experimentation and social statements are key.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Historical Context (1940-1990)</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">WWII and its devastation were powerful catalysts that drove artists to pursue abstraction.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Later, TV, computer, and digital media changed people’s social interactions, and information about the world around them.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>The center of the art world moved from Paris to New York after WWII. New York was the financial and cultural capital of the world.</li>
<li>Many artists moved to New York to embark upon their careers.</li>
<li>Artists pursued abstraction in both painting and sculpture.</li>
<li>Modern architecture was radically altered by the introduction of the computer and 3D imaging.</li>
<li>Modern sculpture had abandoned marble as artists used more industrial materials.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Woman I</em> </strong>by artist<strong> Willem De Kooning </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 6 feet and 4 inches by 6 feet and 4 inches.  </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Took a year and a half to complete (numerous preliminary studies)</li>
<li>Large canvas in reference to history paintings. This is clearly not in content, but he argues this is significant.</li>
<li>He often applied paint to the canvas and scraped it away.</li>
<li>He even discarded this canvas in the trash for a few weeks, then dug it back out.</li>
<li>Handling of paint is thick, rough, and opaque.</li>
<li>Prepared massive quantities of paint in kitchen bowls and constantly tweaked them by adding water or eggs or pigment.</li>
<li><strong>Action painting</strong>: physical, vigorous application of paint, involves the body.</li>
<li>Body is outlined in thick black lines.</li>
<li>Abrupt, angular strokes or <strong>orange, blue, green, yellow, and pink.</strong></li>
<li>Rejects idealization of female body</li>
<li>She is hefty but also flattened</li>
<li>Highly abstracted figure, aggressive brushwork, and intense color palette</li>
<li>Wanted huge canvases to speak to universal truth; take the history painting à make it full abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Critics had declared the figure obsolete in painting.  Instead of abandoning the subject, <strong>de Kooning</strong> readdressed this subject in a series of six paintings. This is the first.</p>
<ul>
<li> “Female painted through the ages” – timelessness</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Repeats tradition in showing us a female nude!</li>
<li>Aggressive, hulking, menacing, vengeful, wild-eyed figure of a sexualized woman
<ul>
<li>Reverses traditional female representations: gigantic eyes, massive breasts, toothy grin</li>
<li>Some accused him of misogyny, but a friend said “I don’t know if he hates women or if he likes them too much…”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An amalgam of female archetypes, from Paleolithic fertility goddesses to 1950s pinup girls (smile influenced by ad of women selling Camel cigarettes)</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>About Abstract Expressionism </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Abstract Expressionism </strong>started in NYC in late 40s and early 50s. It focused on total <strong>abstraction with no reference to representation</strong>, but applied paint to the canvas in a rough, physical manner a la Expressionism.</p>
<p>The theory was this nonrepresentational manner of painting would allow the artist to draw out greater truths and inner ideas. The image was <strong>not preconceived</strong>. It was the result of the creative process and the artist’s impulse.</p>
<p>This was the reaction to WWII and American regionalism. There was a feeling of despair.</p>
<h5><strong>Willem De Kooning</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Willem de Kooning (1904-1997) </strong>was born in the Netherlands. In 1926, he arrived in America, penniless and unable to speak English. He joined AbEx painters but differed in that he applies the Expressionist technique to figures.</p>
<p>The female figure was the subject he was most interested in and has caused much debate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I never was interested in how to make a good painting…,” he once said. “I didn’t work on it with the idea of perfection, but to see how far one could go…” Willem de Kooning</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>The Bay</em></strong> a work of <strong>acrylic on canvas</strong> by <strong>Helen Frankenthaler</strong> measures <strong>six feet eight inches by six feet and nine inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Color Field</strong> is a classification of painting which is achieved through “fields” of color.  The only subject is the color and it is in a non-representational form.</p>
<p><strong>Acrylic</strong> is a fast-drying paint. It is water-soluble, so it can be kept rich and thick, or loosened to have a watercolor look.</p>
<p>To <strong>soak stain</strong> the artist uses diluted acrylic paint, thinned with turpentine so it will run. Here, <strong>Frankenthaler </strong>poured paint onto the canvas. Then, the canvass was lifted and tilted at various angles so the paint would flow across the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Action painting</strong> is the physical manner of applying paint, then picking up the canvas and letting the paint drip across the surface. It is a combination of the unpredictability of gravity and the artist’s control.</p>

<h5><strong>What is our physical response to color?</strong></h5>
<p>We respond to colour in this painting in the same way we might respond to a sunset stained-glass window. These examples illustrate that colors do not have to represent something in particular, but they can instead have an ambiguous quality.</p>
<p>The goal is for the viewer to focus purely on the colors and shapes in the work.</p>
<h5><strong>Colours Chosen by the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>The painting includes different shades of blue, grey, green, and brown.</p>
<h5><strong>In Frankenthaler’s Own Words</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>In a 1965 interview for <em>Artforum Magazine</em> <strong>Helen Frankenthaler</strong> said, “<em>When you first saw an Impressionist painting, there was a whole way of instructing the eye. Dabs of color were understood to stand in for real things. It was a guitar or a hillside. The opposite is going on now. If you have bands of blue, green, and pink, the mind doesn’t first think sky, grass, and flesh. These are colors and now the question is what are they doing with themselves and with others.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Historical Notes </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frankenthaler</strong> was one of the handful of women among the traditional all boys’ club of the <strong>Abstract Expressionists</strong></li>
<li>Clement Greenberg (art critic) believed that if art made after WWII was going to have any real impact on the world, it would have to radically change and truly move towards the abstract.</li>
<li>Post WWII despair led to an interest in abstraction (remember this same thing happens after WWI).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pop Art </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> began in Britain in the mid-1950s. The term was coined by British critic, Lawrence Alloway, in referred to popular mass culture and imagery of the contemporary urban environment.</p>

<p><em><strong>Balloon Dog (Magenta)</strong></em> created between 1994 and 2000 C.E. <strong>by Jeff Koons, </strong>emphasizes the influence of pop culture.</p>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> illustrates everyday objects and transforms them into art objects in a disarming way. This raises the question of what defines an “acceptable art object”. Abstract art was accused of losing touch with reality. A dog made of stainless steel and resembling a child&#8217;s party toy crafted from balloons has maybe too much “reality” in it.</p>

After the abstract art was accused of losing touch with reality a dog made out of stainless steel and re- sembling the children party toys crafted from balloons has maybe too much “reality” in it. The Balloon Dog(Magenta) of Koon is not just any “reality” it is an American one. In no other culture the children parties are not celebrated in such an elaborate manner and with such a multitude of glamorous, yet cheap mass-produced objects. Just like pop-art, children parties use mass produced objects and are designed to appeal to the largest possible audience. The glossy texture of the dog and its strange bright magenta color both suggest the mass-production and are reminiscent of the kitsch souvenirs. Balloon-animals and party favors in general are part of any American childhood. Thus, the sculpture combines two other characteristics of the pop-art the immense capital of something that it is recogniz- able has on selling art and the questionable taste of such a kitsch object." data-userid="928984894598709248" data-orgid="928984895668256768"><em><strong>Balloon Dog (Magenta)</strong></em> by <strong>Koons</strong> is <strong>not just any “reality” it is an American one.</strong>  Only in American culture are parties for children celebrated in such an elaborate manner.

<p><strong><em>Marilyn Diptych </em></strong>by <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> is an artwork created with <strong>oil, acrylic, and silk-screen enamel on canvas</strong>. It measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches by 8 feet 8 inches. </strong></p>
<p>A<strong> diptych</strong>: two panels meant to be viewed together.</p>
<p><strong>Enamel</strong> is an opaque shiny colored glass powder that begins as a liquid and hardens.</p>
<p><strong>Warhol </strong>developed the technique of projecting photographic images to <strong>silk screen. </strong>It enabled him to produce repetitive patterns using a stencil.</p>

<p>To create art like this, mesh cloth is stretched over a heavy wooden frame. The design is printed using a <strong>squeegee </strong>to force color through the pores of the material. The canvas sits underneath and the ink squeezes through to make the image. Any mistakes are a result of the process, rather than with the artist. Ultimately, the artist becomes a machine, removed from the process of intimate artmaking.</p>
<p>It was inspired by Abstract Expressionists in terms of scale only and announces that the subject is grandiose. The all over composition, allows the viewer’s eye to wander.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was this Work Made?</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Commemoration of movie star Marilyn Monroe after her death.</li>

<h5><strong>Profitability</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Warhol</strong> showed he could profit off a celebrity’s image. The silkscreen medium allowed for multiple works and therefore multiple profits. Additionally, he had assistants make the silkscreens for him!</p>
<h5><strong>Ruminate on the Notion of Duality</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Satisfaction vs. Desensitization/Boredom</li>
<li>We want images of celebrities but after we get them, we are indifferent</li>
<li>Our lives really don’t change in any meaningful way</li>
<li>He captures our indifference to her image. Does it really matter that there are 50 instead of 1?</li>
<li>American life is depersonalized and repetitive</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Obsession and Religion</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Obsession with celebrity vs. obsession with religion. Warhol struggled with his Catholic faith.</li>
<li>Our obsession with celebrity borders on the religious. That is why he uses a diptych, commonly reserved for religious imagery.</li>
<li>Use of <strong>gold is deliberately reminiscent of Byzantine icons</strong></li>
<li>Invites us to <strong>worship</strong> Marilyn as we would Mary</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Celebrity Persona vs Death</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Contrast of vivid color with black and white and the fading in the right panel are suggestive of her mortality (Marilyn had in fact just died of suicide)</li>
<li>She is right in front of us (celebrities live on in images) but disappearing (her body does not exist anymore)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Details </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>50 images</strong> (25 color, 25 black and white) of Marilyn’s publicity photograph from the 1953 film <em>Niagara.</em></li>
<li><strong>Her image: </strong>seductive, heavy-lidded eyes, parted plump lips</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Rest of the Story</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> argued that <strong>our obsessions and culture</strong> are exalted enough that they can be ennobled into art. This way, Pop Art shows us what matters to us.</p>
<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> died in August, 1962 of apparent suicide. Warhol’s artwork was made just a few months later.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Before becoming a leading artist in the Pop Art movement of the 1960s, American-born <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> <strong>(1928-1987)</strong> was an illustrator for both print magazines, as well as advertising.</p>

<p><strong>Warhol</strong> was noted for using everyday objects in his work. Examples includes the pieces like <em>Campbell’s Soup Cans</em>. As noted above, his works often include celebrities such as movie star Elizabeth Taylor, Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones, and rock legend Elvis Presley.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks </em></strong>by <strong>Claes Oldenburg</strong> is made from<strong> Cor-Ten steel, steel, aluminium, and cast resin. </strong>It is<strong> painted with polyurethane enamel </strong>and stands<strong> 24 feet tall. </strong></p>
<p>The original version was made of inexpensive materials including plywood tracks. It was not initially intended to be permanent and was damaged buy both deterioration and vandalism.</p>
<p>The new construction began with stronger materials. <strong>Cor-Ten steel</strong> rusts and eliminates the need for paint as the rust becomes the color.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this Art was Made </strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks </em></strong>was originally commissioned by students from the Yale School of Architecture to disrupt a public space, create a political statement, and to be used as a platform for public speakers, while making anti-war speeches.</p>
<p>It was placed in <strong>Beinecke Plaza on the Yale Campus</strong> and overlooked the office of Yale’s president and a WWI memorial on campus. The red lipstick was originally meant to be deflated when the platform was not in use and inflated to get students’ attention.</p>

<p>The work was a satirical comment on the Vietnam War with hawkish, hyper-masculine rhetoric of the military verses a feminine tube of lipstick. It was <strong>a comment on masculinity and femininity</strong> with the traditional masculinity of war (hard, gritty, violent) verses traditional femininity of lipstick (sensual, soft, alluring).</p>
<p>The inclusion of lipstick in this work also took on an additional meaning in <strong>commemoration of Yale becoming a coeducational university</strong>. It allowed female students into the undergrad programs for the first time <strong>in 1969</strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>Historical Backgrounder </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> was a growing trend in <strong>American artwork</strong> in the 1950s and 1960s. It <strong>elevated the everyday</strong> and made these subjects appropriate for fine art.</p>
<p><strong>The Vietnam War</strong> was escalating at the time the work was created. There were many protests on college campuses against the war. Yale was one of those places.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>Swedish-born conceptual/pop artist <strong>Claes Oldenburg </strong>was born in 1929. He began proposing large-scale sculptures of everyday objects as a tribute to American consumer culture.  He is known for his ingenious, oversized renditions of ordinary objects elevated to a grand size (art historical tradition tells us if the artwork is large, it must be significant).</p>

<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> by artist <strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was made entirely of reflective <strong>mirror balls</strong> of highly polished stainless steel. Each mirror ball measured eight inches across. There was a total of 1500 balls in the original <strong>installation</strong>. Later, she would recreate the installation around the globe in a multitude of versions and settings.</p>

<p>This work is considered <strong>performance art</strong>. This means artwork that is a performance, time sensitive, and only preserved in photographs. In this case, viewers could see themselves and their surroundings in the work. It expressed the idea of illusion and infinity.</p>
<h5>Based on Mythology</h5>
<p>The title of this work has a reference to the classics. <strong>Narcissus</strong> the mythological hunter, fell in love with his reflection in a pool. <strong>Narcissism</strong> is the egotistical admiration of one’s own self.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1914" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/148-Original-Story.jpg?resize=750%2C457&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="457" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/148-Original-Story.jpg?w=463&amp;ssl=1 463w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/148-Original-Story.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Message</strong></h5>
<p>The work was a critique of the narcissism of art world and commercialization. Monetary exchange between Kusama and her customers underscored the economic system in art production and exhibition.</p>
<p>It also spoke of the pressure on artists to sell artwork, an experience, their brand, and the need for self-promotion. They must market and promote themselves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> became more and more popular. The balls became collector’s items.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> was first installed in the <strong>Venice Biennale</strong>, a major contemporary art show in 1966. Yet, the artists had not officially been invited to exhibit!</p>
<p>This work of<strong> performance art </strong>was originally on a grass lawn on which <strong>Kusama</strong> set 1,500 mirror balls on. She was dressed in a gold kimono. Each ball was sold for 1,200 lira ($2). There was a sign that said, “Your narcissism for sale!”</p>

<p>Venetian authorities reprimanded her and fined her.</p>
<p>A<strong> happening is a term</strong> coined in late 1950s to describe performance art that is initially planned but <strong>involves spontaneity, improvisation, and audience participation</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was born in 1929. She is a self-taught artist who has now chosen to live in a Tokyo mental facility.</p>
<p>She had difficulty finding acceptance in the art world as both a woman and foreigner. She also lived in a society recovering from WWII prejudice against Japan.</p>
<p>Mirrors and repetition are a theme in her artwork, as she says it helps her to process her insanity. She reminds the viewer that <strong>Pop Art didn’t just focus on consumer culture (celebrities, soup cans) but also on our own vanity and ego</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Spiral Jetty</em></strong> by artist<strong> Robert Smithson </strong>is an<strong> Earthwork </strong>made from <strong>mud, precipitated salt crystals, rocks, and water coil, </strong>located in<strong> Great Salt Lake, Utah, US. </strong>It measures<strong> 1,500 feet long.</strong></p>
<p>An<strong> Earthwork</strong> is a site-specific piece, set outdoors in the West made of natural materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiral Jetty </em></strong><strong>is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Located at Rozel Point peninsula on the Northeast shore of the Great Salt Lake</li>
<li>All materials are from this site</li>
<li>Over 6,000 tons of black basalt rock</li>
<li>Coil is 1,500 feet long and 15 feet wide that winds counterclockwise off the shore into the water</li>
<li>Dump trucks and tractors took six days</li>
<li>The <strong>artist was insistent</strong> about switching rocks around to create the look he wanted</li>
<li><strong>Water level varies</strong> with precipitation in the mountains
<ul>
<li><strong>Jetty is revealed in times of drought and submerged in times of normal precipitation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lake is naturally pink or red</strong> due to bacteria and algae that thrive in the saline water</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Who was this Work Made For?</strong></h5>
<p>This is a question that many people ask. The <strong>location is remote</strong> (100 miles NW of Salt Lake City) and <strong>difficult to get to</strong> (a 15-mile dirt road from highway with potholes so big VW beetles get stuck in them).</p>
<p>This work <strong>challenges traditional notions about art in a gallery space</strong>. It also expands the definition of the art object.</p>
<p><strong>Spiral Jetty </strong>requires the viewer’s engagement to walk out along it and experience it.</p>
<h5><strong>A Disappearing Medium</strong></h5>
<p>Also, this work does not have the power of longevity. <strong>Entropy</strong> is the decline into disorder, inevitability of time and the disintegration of all objects in nature. It is the power of natural forces over man-made forces. The jetty will naturally disappear over time.</p>
<p>Originally the work was almost all black basalt, but salt encrustation has turned it a pinkish white.</p>
<p>Not only will nature erode its own work, but human experience (viewers walking) will erode it too.</p>
<p>This draws attention to <strong>environmental issues</strong>. What is our human effect on the environment? How can we preserve it?</p>
<h5><strong> C</strong><strong>ontent</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Spiral Jetty </strong>is a three-part artwork:</p>
<ol>
<li>sculpture</li>
<li>essay by Smithson</li>
<li>film documenting the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>coil shape</strong>, Smithson believed, was a shape that was natural and organic. Unlike Modernist squares and circles and more geometric forms, <strong>coils suggest growth and decay</strong>, a perpetual cycle</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p>Smithson <strong>leased the site</strong> for a small annual fee and <strong>contracted the construction</strong> with money given to him by a New York gallery. He was interested in this site because it was where an abandoned industrial site had left machinery on the coast to decay. This made him think about decay and man versus nature. Also, the American Southwest had vast open spaces, seen as quintessential in unspoiled nature.</p>
<p>The sculpture is now owned by the state of Utah.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Artist Robert Smithson started out creating paintings and collages before moving to sculpture, which he assembled using scattered materials. Soon, he moved his works out of galleries and into landscapes.</p>
<p>He was best known for his <strong>Earthwork</strong> or <strong>Land art.</strong></p>
<p>Smithson died in a plane crash in 1973. He was 35.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> by<strong> Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>was a<strong> mixed-media installation </strong>that was placed in<strong> New York City, US and spanned 23 miles long </strong>as a work of<strong> site-specific art. </strong></p>
<p>The installation was comprised of<strong> 7,503 gates across footpaths in Central Park</strong>. Each <strong>16-foot-tall gate</strong> had a piece of <strong>saffron colored fabric</strong> hanging to 7 feet above ground level. The widths of the gates matched the widths of the walkways. Gates were set down to avoid drilling.  The structures formed an oval path that intersected. There was no start or ending points.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> introduced eye-catching color into the landscape and infused light into a winter scene. Orange contrasted with brown and gave off the “spring is coming” vibe.</p>
<p>The work was temporary with all materials intended for recycling or sale.</p>

<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The installation was free to the public. The artists wanted to alter the experience of walking in the park to be an original, temporary experience. A golden ceiling creating warm shadows for visitors, as well as a refuge from city life. It encouraged people to go outdoors. It made people look and drew attention to the landscape.</p>
<p>In aerial view. <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> looked like a golden river that appeared and disappeared among the trees in the park.</p>
<p>How does art respond to and impact our relationship with the built environment? What is natural? What is “constructed”?</p>
<p>This work helped to move visitors from being unaware of their surroundings to aware and engaged.</p>

<p><strong>The Gates</strong> was only exhibited from February 12<sup>th</sup> – February 27<sup>th</sup>, 2005, in Central Park.</p>

<p>The fabric moved organically with the wind. Light moved through it mirroring the visitors’ movement underneath it.</p>
<p>The installation was inspired by Japanese Shinto tradition of torii (gates) that mark the transition at shrines from the secular to the sacred.</p>

<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>The husband-and-wife artist team of  <strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude </strong>developed the concept for the art installation in 1979. It was not produced until 2005. For this reason, we can consider it as linked to environmental/site-specific art of the 1970s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1941" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1941" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1941" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=635%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="635" height="424" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/224-Artists.jpg?w=1787&amp;ssl=1 1787w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1941" class="wp-caption-text">Christo and Jeanne-Claude</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> cost $21 million. The artist financed the project themselves. There were no sponsors, instead they self-fund every project and sold merchandise related to the exhibition. Part of the costs of the work were wages for 600 workers to install it. The team also paid for security guards at night.</p>
<p>The artists had to submit proposals, attend meetings, and make presentations to  both the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy administration. In 1982, they received a 251-page rejection.</p>
<p>The election of Michael Bloomberg, in 2001, who was a fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, was the turning point.</p>
<p>Central Park was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was meant as a city refuge. It recalled ideas of the Victorian pastoral and picturesque.</p>
<p>People criticized <strong><em>The Gates</em></strong> for interfering with man’s relationship with nature. But the irony is that Central Park itself was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as a city refuge.</p>

Portrait</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> The Broad in LA</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players </em></strong>by artist <strong>Jean-Michel </strong>Basquiat is an <strong>acrylic and oil paintstick on three canvas panels</strong> measuring <strong>18 feet by 6 feet 3 inches.  Paintstick</strong> is a “crayon” with various oils/pigments mixed in. This allows the artist to draw oil paint.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> is a<strong> triptych</strong> with a flat, dark background color uniting all three panels. Each canvas has flat patches of color and dense thick lines.</p>
<p>This <strong>Neo-Expressionism</strong> work retains rough handling, jagged forms and jarring color, but now has a focus on the body. Pride of place has made an exit as the important figures are off to the sides. Large sections of white paint seem to obscure what was underneath.</p>
<p>There is no sense of scale or balance. The artist relies heavily on juxtaposition and contrast to make the painting dynamic and expressive. The traditional approach to 3D space is gone.</p>
<h5><strong>What is the Function of <em>Horn Players</em>?</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This work connects <strong>graffiti with jazz and fine art. </strong>Through this it elevates the practice of graffiti itself to a fine art. It also connects <strong>jazz to African American culture</strong> thereby honoring African American history and contributions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn Player</em></strong>s was inspired by the scatting and improvisational work performed in jazz. <strong><em>Horn Players</em></strong> replicates that technique here.</p>

<h5><strong>Up Close </strong></h5>
<p>On the <strong>left panel</strong> Charlie Parker (saxophonist) plays his instrument and emits hot pink notes and sounds. On the <strong>central panel</strong> an abstracted head floats in space.</p>
<p>On the <strong>right panel</strong> Dizzy Gillespie (trumpeter) holds his trumpet along his side. The words DOH SHOO DE OBEE floats to the left. This reminds the viewer of Gillespie’s scat as a wordless improvisation.</p>
<h5><strong>Wordplay </strong></h5>
<p>A number of words appear on the canvases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dizzy</li>
<li>Ornithology (study of birds, as well as the title of a famous composition by Charlie Parker in reference to his own nickname Bird)</li>
<li>Pree (Parker’s daughter)</li>
<li>Teeth</li>
<li>Alchemy</li>
<li>Feet</li>
<li>Soap</li>
<li>Larynx misspelled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wordplay</strong> is a characteristic of <strong>Basquiat’s </strong>work, yet not all fully understood.</p>
<h5><strong>Common Subject Matter</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Musicians </strong>were a common subject for <strong>Basquiat</strong>. He had briefly played in a band. <strong>Anatomical terms</strong> were also common. His mother bought him a <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> textbook as a child for fun.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity to Picasso’s <em>Horn Players</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on <strong>Basquiat</strong> being called the black Picasso</li>
<li>We must draw upon our knowledge of traditional painting to understand this work</li>
<li>Triptych format echoes the trio of figures</li>
<li>Parker is in the same position as the standing figure with the clarinet in Picasso’s work</li>
<li>Central figure in Basquiat’s work is likened to the distorted face of the middle figure in Picasso’s</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Emergence of Urban Graffiti</strong></h5>
<p>Urban graffiti was an emerging artform in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Basquiat was one of the leaders.</p>
<h5><strong>About Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong></h5>
<p>Basquiat was a homeless NYC queer man of color. He was a <strong>graffiti artist, sex worker and poet</strong>. Discovered in 1981 at age 20, he became dazzlingly successful at a quick speed.</p>
<p>He was known for his tag SAMO (Same Old Shit) written in marker and spray paint on subway trains, sidewalks, and gallery walls. This attracted the attention of gallery owners and the art world.</p>
<p>Based on his success, critics referred to him as the “black Picasso”. While this likened him to Picasso, Basquiat felt conflicted about this term, because the word black was added.</p>
<p>He once said, “If you wanna talk about influence, man, then you’ve got to realize that influence is not influence. It’s simply someone’s idea going through my new mind.”</p>
<p>Some of his paintings have sold for $20 million. The artist died at the age of 27 from a heroin overdose.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Art News Update!</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Andy Warhol’s portrait of Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong> was up for auction at Christie’s in November 2021.  The pre-estimate was US$20 million.</p>
<p>“From Brooklyn to China, Basquiat symbolizes a new generation, and Warhol recognized this earlier than anyone. His unmatched ability to capture celebrity, fame, glory, and tragedy culminates in this portrait,” Alex Rotter, Christie’s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art, said in a statement. “Just as much about Basquiat as it is about Warhol, it is one of the most exciting paintings to come to the auction market.”</p>
<p>How much did it sell for? <strong>$40,091,500!</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Androgyne III</em></strong> by artist<strong> Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>is a work comprised of<strong> burlap, resin, wood, nails, and string </strong>measuring<strong> 4 feet tall.</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> burlap</strong> is manipulated into a figurative composition. It is meant to appear rough and course. This is  an abstracted, simplified, dramatically reduced figure that is hollow with no head, forearms, or shins. A mold process was used to make the form out of burlap, with resin to stiffen it.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round</strong> and should also be viewed from the back.</p>

<h5><strong>Why is this Neo-Expressionism? </strong></h5>
<p>This work is a return to the body and the expressive capabilities of the bodies. This was believed to have had been lost in Pop Art and Site-Specific Art. It is a rejection of the modernist attitude that the body is dead. Additionally, the style is a revival of Expressionism, with rough, jagged handling, and sharp forms.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This work examines the <strong>relationship between individual and community</strong> (isolation and loss). It notes <strong>dehumanization and lack of identity</strong> are the result of strife, war, anguish, derision.</p>
<p>It <strong>depicts isolation and loss</strong> in a universal way. We cannot identify this figure specifically. So much of this figure has been lost, destroyed, and hurt. Our own identities become lost and are vulnerable in our modern, violent worlds.</p>
<p><strong>We identify and recognize this figure</strong> even though we see SO little of it. Destruction leaves us as shells of who we once were.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This <strong>androgynous figure</strong> focuses on humanity, rather than gender. Notice the body language. The shoulders are pulled forward, with a slumping back.</p>
<p>The figure in deep despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>wrinkled skin</li>
<li>backbone</li>
<li>musculature</li>
<li>veins</li>
<li>missing limbs and head</li>
</ul>
<p>It is elevated from the floor by a wood structure as base. Does this fill in for the legs?  Is this a wheelchair? Gurney?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Androgyne III</em> Comparison</strong></p>
<p>Human condition is a constant preoccupation of post-modern art. Once the artists started questioning the constraints the society imposes on humans, they never stopped attacking its pre-constructed judgements.</p></blockquote>
<p>To the Polish artist <strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz</strong> it is important to reflect on dehumanization and the loss of individuality in the modern society. The artwork <strong><em>Androgyne II</em></strong> was created in 1985, during widespread food shortages. Numerous hunger demonstrations were sweeping Poland and people could not even buy even rationed foods. The demonstrations were silent and comprised of men, women, and children.</p>
<p>As a reaction to the Communist propaganda which depicted happy smiling workers, she created a series of <strong>neo-expressionist sculptures</strong> based on fibers. <strong><em>Androgyne II</em></strong> was molded in burlap, simplified, hollowed and rendered headless and armless. The figure is carried on symbolic stretchers.</p>
<p>We are still able to identify and recognize the destructed body as a human, but we cannot identify the figure specifically. The focus is on the humanity of the figure, on the suffering to which the androgyne is subjected and makes his/her shoulders be pulled forward.</p>
<p>The wrinkled skin and backbone lead us to see the person as the result of a destruction process. We are invited to think of the living process that tore apart our identities to the point of being lost and extremely vulnerable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, El Anatsui the artist behind the post-modernist artwork <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth (2003)</em></strong> provokes a discussion on the continued impact of European slave trade, exploitation of the people of Ghana and Africa in general. <strong><em>Old Man’s Cloth</em></strong> is not a fiber work, even though it preserves a lot of the qualities of Kente traditional textiles that inspired it. It is made from bottle caps found in the Ghana bush to emphasize the alcohol consumption problem created by the introduction of European alcohol as part of the slave trade.</p>
<p>It is gold like, just like the gold that the British extracted from Ghana until its post WWII independence. It is not precious. It is only an illusion. This illusory and precarious aspect is also suggested by the fact the “cloth” comes with no hanging indications and thus each exhibit curator can find her/his own patterns. Nevertheless, the carefulness of the assembly suggests that the spirit of the nation is not broken and it can be rekindled.</p>
<p>The revival of the tradition is the artist’s deep hopes. He joined the Sankofa movement that re- claimed Africa’s rich traditional culture.</p>
<p>By trying to find meaning and hope in ugliness or discarded debris the artists expand the materials that can be used to create art and repudiate the categories of beautiful and ugly. By avoiding a clear finished state of their artworks, these artists fit into what is called “brut art”. They try to provoke raw emotions and challenge the definition of acceptable human life in the viewer.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz </strong>was considered <strong>a pioneer of fiber-based sculpture. </strong>Her art was affected by her experiences in Poland, under Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II.</p>
<p>Born in 1930, she lived on a large estate in Poland. Here she often played in the woods. She said this later inspired her to use natural materials in her works.</p>
<p>In WWII, German tanks entered her family’s estate. Later a drunk German soldier burst into the house and shot off her mother’s arm in front of her. In 1944, the family fled, as the Soviet army arrived and moved into Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>Abakanowicz</strong> worked as a nurse in a hospital, caring for the wounded. This would later affect her art.</p>
<p>When the war was over, she attended art school at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Warsaw. Poland was a part of the Soviet Bloc. Social Realism was the style taught in art schools with smiling workers and images of a perfect society. She tried to avoid learning this style by choosing to work with textiles. Yet,  she had to adopt it to obtain a degree and enter the Polish Artist Union.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Smithsonian American Art Museum</p>
<p><strong><em>Electronic Superhighway</em></strong> by artist <strong>Nam June Paik</strong> is a <strong>mixed-media installation (49-channel closed-circuit video installation, neon, steel, and electric components)</strong> measuring 15 by 40 feet.</p>
<p>This huge, towering stack of TVs simultaneously shows multiple clips from a variety of sources. His studio was small, so he had to squish Texas and Florida. In total there are 336 TVs: 3,750 feet of cable and 575 feet of colored tubing.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist used video to show the speed of our increasingly <strong>electronic modern lives</strong>. It also celebrates an <strong>America influenced by film and television</strong>.</p>
<p>How have these things shaped who we think we are? How are we connected to each other via media? Is the effect of technology always a good thing? Can we have information overload?</p>
<p>This is <strong>a contrast between</strong> actual road trips, with a trip across the US in the gallery, with virtual travel on the Internet.</p>
<p>Notice the size and energy. All this plays into the American identity Paik was captivated by.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An <strong>enormous scale</strong> suggests the huge size of the nation. There is a map of the US with <strong>neon</strong> outlining the states. Neon reminded him of the signs for motels and restaurants that dot the highways. Different colors remind us that states have different identities.</p>
<p><strong>Images</strong> are flashing and rapidly changing. This is reminiscent of billboards being seen from passing cars.</p>
<p>Within each state, the screen displays video clips that resonate with each state’s own identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kansas: <em>Wizard of Oz </em>(film)</li>
<li>Oklahoma: <em>Oklahoma </em>(film)</li>
<li>Iowa: footage of presidential candidates</li>
<li>Idaho: potatoes</li>
<li>Missouri: <em>Meet Me in St. Louis </em>(film)</li>
<li>Texas: cowgirls, cactus</li>
<li>New York: Empire State Building</li>
<li>Maine: clips of a friend</li>
<li>California: hallucinogens, Golden Gate Bridge, OJ Simpson</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art</strong></h5>
<p>Nam June Paik was born in Seoul, in 1932. He was considered <strong>the father of video art</strong>, with his first video art exhibit in 1963.</p>
<p>When Paik came to the US In 1964, the interstate highway system was only 9 years old. Highways offered everyone the freedom to see the USA. Highways were new and heavily advertised, as a way for Americans to see the country on a limited budget.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Crossing</em></strong> by<strong> Bill Viola </strong>is a<strong> video/sound </strong>installation that uses a double-sided screen on a freestanding piece of clear acrylic. It was shot using high-speed film that achieved 300 frames per second in great detail. Viola reduced the speed of the playback to extremely slow motion. This enhances the drama. Sound amplifies the experience.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The artist wanted to create an immersive sound and video environment to dwell on transformation and change as well as growth and decay. These are inevitable processes.</p>
<p>Slow-motion is not just a technological choice. It is meant to invite a meditative and contemplative response. One that requires the viewer to concentrate for longer and slows us down. This increases our awareness of movement, detail, and change. This creates a connection between the artistic and spiritual experience. We could interpret it in a religious way, even though the work makes no direct iconographic or religious overtones.</p>

<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are two different video sequences that are simultaneously shown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Water + fire = duality</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>water video </strong>the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A trickle of water overhead appears until he disappears in a deluge. As the water ceases, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>In the <strong>fire video</strong> the male figure walks slowly towards the camera. After several minutes, he pauses, staring directly into the lens. A flame starts at his feet and spreads over his legs and torso until he disappears in flames. As the fire dies down, the figure has vanished.</p>
<p>This draws on universal truths about life and death from Eastern/Western traditions. Fire/water is a barrier between this world and the next. Humans struggle to survive both of these in disasters.</p>

<h5><strong>Flames</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Water</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Biblical flood by Michelangelo</li>
<li>Great Wave</li>
<li>Basin</li>
<li>Slave Ship (destruction, cleansing)</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements  often symbolize change, redemption, transformation, and renewal.</p>
<p>The act of self-annihilation in the figure’s disappearance serves as a metaphor for destruction of the ego.</p>
<p>The title <em>The Crossing </em>is in references to the crossing of an individual to a different state of being.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Describes a childhood experience of almost drowning as “beautiful” and “without fear”.</li>
<li>Viola is a devoted Zen Buddhist.</li>
<li>In college, he majored in religious studies, psychology, and electrical engineering&#8211; all clearly visible here.</li>
<li>Inspired by Nam June Paik, an early innovator in the field of video art.</li>
<li>Even though the art object has greatly changed, the themes of life, death, religion, redemption continue.</li>

<p><strong><em>Seagram Building </em></strong>in <strong>New York City </strong>was designed by <strong>architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, with interior furnishings by Philip Johnson</strong>. Constructed from <strong>steel with a glass curtain wall and bronze </strong>the building measures 515 feet tall with 38 stories. When it was constructed, the cost was astronomical an $36 million dollars.</p>
<p><em> </em><strong>Mies</strong> believed that “<strong>Less is More</strong>”</p>
<ul>
<li>Evokes the simplicity of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye and International Style</li>
<li>Symmetrical, sense of balanced proportion</li>
<li>Clean, simple, geometry</li>
<li>Vertical mullions rise without interruption (these are only decorative and part of the curtain-wall architecture)</li>
<li>Elegance of construction</li>
<li>Bronze mullions were rubbed with oil at least once a year, so they do not oxidize and become patina in color.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though we might think this was not classical because of its different color and lack of ornamentation, it invokes the classical precedent. These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bronze: common in Greek sculpture</li>
<li>Pillars in front of building are fluted</li>
<li>Building is set atop a base similar to a stylobate</li>
<li>There is a sense of symmetry and proportion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technological innovations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used glass and metal, not stone and brick</li>
<li><strong>Curtain-wall architecture</strong>: outermost walls are non-structural</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Office building for Seagram Liquor company (this was their headquarters)</li>
<li>Ushered in a new era of skyscrapers (minimalist geometries without ornament/detail)</li>
<li>Testament to just how influential the Seagram Building was that it now seems commonplace</li>
<li>Created standard for modern skyscraper</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This office building with an empty space in front was innovative and radical at the time. The open, urban plaza set the building back from Park Avenue and created a <strong>pedestrian space.  Inside</strong>, the building is luxurious in its use of <strong>bronze, travertine</strong>, and <strong>marble</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Office spaces were furnished by Philip Johnson</strong> who was the director of architecture at MOMA.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Notes</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Seagram,</strong> a large Canadian liquor company was the largest at that time. It flourished during prohibition because they were based in Canada, and not the United States.</p>
<p>The initial building pan was rejected by Phyllis Lambert, daughter of a Seagram owner. She was a Harvard architecture student and said the original design was the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She gave her father three choices of architects to employ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frank Lloyd Wright was rejected because at the age of 90 he was considered too old.</li>
<li>Le Corbusier was discovered to be too difficult to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</strong> was given the gig!</p>

<h5><strong>About the Architect</strong></h5>
<p>German-born architect<strong> Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</strong> was a director of a German architecture school called the Bauhaus. Nazis eventually shut down for being too modernist!</p>
<p>He came to the US in the late 1930s. His love of classical architecture and sculpture were his inspiration</p>

<p><strong><em>House in New Castle County</em></strong> by architects <strong>Robert Venturi, John Rauch, and Denise Scott Brown</strong> is a <strong>wood frame and stucco</strong> building in <strong>Delaware, US</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>“front” façade</strong> incorporates a floating arched screen in front of the home. This was done because the owners liked bird watching, and it camouflaged them. The <strong>“rear” façade</strong> was dominated by a <strong>pointed arch porch</strong> similar to a pediment and supported by four stubby flat “columns” that evoke the Doric order</p>
<p>The is no internal or external symmetry. It is unique and eclectic. Venturi said “<strong>Less is a Bore</strong>” in reaction to modernism and its simplicity.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>House in New Castle County</em></strong> was built as a private residence for a family of three who loved bird watching and music.</p>
<p>For Venturi, this is his summary of his Less is a Bore mentality. Rather than copy a specific style, he borrowed freely, juxtaposing, and reinterpreting different forms from other periods and styles</p>

<li>1966: published a book, <em>Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture</em> (very successful!)
<ul>
<li>Wanted to reject what Le Corbusier (house is a machine for living in) and van der Rohe (less is more) had done</li>
<li>Believed structures should have:

Materials with significance</p>
<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</em></strong><em> by </em><strong>Maya Lin</strong> is comprised of <strong>granite</strong> and stands in <strong>Washington D.C., US</strong>. <strong>Each arm is 246 feet by 9 inches long. </strong></p>
<p>This work is a highly reflective <strong>black granite</strong> formed into a <strong>V-shaped wall</strong>.  It is <strong>sunk into the land</strong> rather than set on top of it. The two walls point towards either the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument. Where the walls meet, they are 10.1 feet high. Each wall slopes at the ends to less than a foot and is covered with <strong>text only</strong>. There are <strong>no images</strong>.</p>
<p>The work was inspired by <strong>Minimalism</strong>. This art movement that begins in the 1960s in the US, aims to eliminate all non-essentials in an artwork by reducing it to its most simple geometric elements. It goes further than Cubism.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Lin had to create a way to <strong>commemorate loss</strong> without designing a memorial that would tell people what to think about Vietnam. It needed to be approachable and apolitical, with a focus on work being a place of mourning and healing.</p>
<p>The design does not aim to resolve conflicting emotions about the validity of the war. Instead, it is meant to be a space for catharsis, mourning and contemplation.</p>
<p>The viewer must engage with the work close up to interact with it. The reflection of the loved one’s name is a powerful reminder of their sacrifice for the country.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1954" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/223-A.jpg?resize=700%2C393&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/223-A.jpg?w=552&amp;ssl=1 552w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/223-A.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1955" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/225-B.png?resize=700%2C625&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="625" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/225-B.png?w=402&amp;ssl=1 402w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/225-B.png?resize=300%2C268&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The <strong>sunken placement</strong> was meant to evoke <strong>a spiritual journey</strong> for the viewer. They enter and sink deeper to reflect on the death of the soldiers. The living are carrying on the memory.  It also signifies a deep cut in the earth that will heal over time, but <strong>there will always be a scar.</strong></p>
<p>The wall was intentionally made reflective and shiny. The names of the dead literally comprise our bodies’ reflection. The message is we are here because of their sacrifice.  While we see reflections, they are not as clear as a mirror.  It is as if we are gazing into a ghostly realm.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The single memorial device used is <strong>text not imagery.</strong> Visitors read the names of those lost, engraved in chronological order.</p>
<p><em>Thus, the war’s beginning and end meet; the war is ‘complete,’ coming full circle yet broken by the earth that bounds the angle’s open side and continued with the earth itself.</em></p>
<p>The work was intentionally shaped like a book. Visitors read names from left to right. <strong>There are 72 panels containing 58,286 names.</strong> These names are listed in order of when the men and women died or were declared missing. There have been periodic additions.</p>
<p>The growth of the structure <strong>perfectly parallels the number of deaths</strong>, almost like a timeline. The lowest number of deaths are shown at the beginning and end, with the greatest number in the middle.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial </em></strong><em>was </em>designed by a 21-year-old Yale University junior named <strong>Maya Lin</strong>, in 1981. She was still a student at Yale’s School of Architecture. The work was made for a public design competition. Her professor had assigned this as a project for his students. (Meanwhile, she only received a B+ grade on it from the professor!)</p>
<p>Her design was one of over 2,573 submissions, in response to a call for entries by the US government.</p>
<p>The idea came from the Yale Memorial Rotunda. Alumni who had been killed in war have their names inscribed on the walls. She used to touch the names and feel contemplative.</p>
<p>She did not do any specific research on the war because she felt politics had eclipsed the veterans. She wanted the focus to remain on the deceased.</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was a disaster on all counts. Most Americans believed the war was a moral tragedy. All of America knew it had been lost. Most opposed to the war did not blame the soldiers but the government, although some did attack soldiers or disrespect them upon their return. The vets were angry with the lack of respect and distraught about the great loss.</p>
<p>The average age of names on the wall is 19.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for a US soldier upon putting their boots on the ground in Vietnam was 1 month.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Vast Criticism</strong></h5>
<p>Lin was resoundingly criticized for this work.</p>
<p>The <strong>black color </strong>was said to not match with the rest of the US Mall. It was called “black gash on Mall”.</p>
<p>People interpreted the color black as a symbol of shame and dishonor over the war. Lin meant it as a sign of mourning. Additionally, black was seen as a color in Asian art, and was not typical in American, Western, or classical art&#8211;that color would have been white.</p>
<p>The work was considered <strong>nonrepresentational and not traditional</strong>.  It lacked ornamentation and did not follow traditional funerary sculpture. Many thought the design was too simple and did not depict honor and sacrifice in a traditional way.</p>
<p><strong>War veterans wanted a traditional and realistic sculpture</strong>. One is added off to the side to assuage concerns.</p>

<p>People wondered why a young Asian American woman from an Ivy League college who did not know the realities of war was the artist. Why would she be picked to design a monument about deaths in an Asian war?</p>
<p>Building permits were refused. It took a 4 Star Brigadier General to testify before subcommittee hearings and defend the color before the project moved forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maya Lin</strong><em> said, “It took me 9 months to ask the VVMF, in charge of building the memorial, if my race was an issue. It had never occurred to me that it would be, and I think they had taken all the measures they could to shield me from comments about a “gook” designing the memorial. I remember reading the article that appeared in The Washington Post referring to “An Asian Memorial for an Asian War” and I knew we were in trouble.”</em></p>
<p>She continued by saying<em>, “The controversy exploded in Washington after that. Ironically, one side attacked the design for being “too Asian,” while others saw its simplicity and understatement, not as an intention to create a more Eastern, meditative space, but as a minimalist statement which they interpreted as being non-referential and disconnected from human experience. This left the opinion in many that the piece emanated from a series of intellectualized aesthetic decisions, which automatically pitted artist against veterans. The fact that I was from an Ivy League college and had hair down to my knees further fueled this distrust of the design and suspicions of a hippie college liberal or aesthetic elitist forcing her art and commentary upon them.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> by American architect <strong>Frank Gehry</strong> was constructed using <strong>titanium, glass, and limestone</strong>. This example of Post-Modern architecture stands in <strong>Bilbao, Spain.</strong></p>
<p>Post-Modernism used organic, rounded forms with asymmetrical designs rather than Modernist crisp, clean, long, straight lines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1756" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1756" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1756" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-C.jpg?resize=750%2C582&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="582" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-C.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-C.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1756" class="wp-caption-text">Guggenheim Museum Bilbao site plan<br />© FMGB Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa</figcaption></figure>
<p>This style is called <strong>deconstructivism</strong>. There is a bending and twisting of traditional styles to create a new aesthetic. This creates an unstable environment with unusual spatial arrangements. It looks bulging, warped, curling, tumbling. This is surprising to us because the look of the building disrupts our assumption that architecture is inherently stable.</p>
<p><strong>Gehry</strong> described this work as “form follows fantasy”. It is a non-traditional building in both design and materials. He used a computer program called Catia, originally invented for aerospace engineering to design buildings.</p>
<p>The shiny titanium tiles that sheathe the building give it strength and shine. The look was inspired by the scales of fish. The fishing industry/shipbuilding industry was once a major part of Bilbao’s economy.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This building was constructed to serve as <strong>a museum of modern and contemporary art.</strong> The Guggenheim collection in NYC was too large for their space. This housed the overflow.</p>
<p>This building challenged the traditions of museum design and the thinking that it should be classical in form.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1754" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/240-B.jpg?resize=489%2C734&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="489" height="734" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> is based on the curvature of the Guggenheim Museum in NYC. It also takes design cues from the Italian Baroque style of drapery and fabric, with bending, rippling, and unfurling.</p>
<p>Notice how the building looks like a ship. It is set by the water. The reflective quality of the building was intended to show the glittering water and sun’s reflection.</p>
<p>The<em> Spider </em>sculpture in front is entitled “Maman” by Louise Bourgeois. It means mother in French and was designed to show vulnerability, lightness, negative space.</p>
<p>The architect wanted to remove historical references. Most museums were done in variants of Neoclassicism – stone structures with pedimented fronts, colonnades, lofty and rational spaces.</p>
<p>The layout was an arrangement to focus on a central atrium with the 165-foot entrance.  This serves as a circulation hub and orientation gallery, providing access to the other 20 galleries on three levels.</p>
<p>The exhibition spaces have surprising shapes and does not follow the white cube method. Instead, it uses angled or curving walls and balconies. It is a complex and somewhat chaotic interior, with twisting glass-and-steel walls. It does not follow traditional Neoclassical design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The building was very well received and the benefit to local economy was immediate and substantial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</em></strong> was part of an ambitious urban renewal program to help the aging port and industrial city that had experienced significant decline in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Geographically, the location provided cheap land for a major museum, as opposed to a thriving European or American city. <strong>Deconstructivism’s fragmented forms</strong> represented uncertainty of contemporary life, like the downfall of Soviet Union the Berlin Wall and the 1987 stock market.</p>

<h4><strong>Theme: “Abstraction”</strong></h4>
<p>Cutting-edge artists made figures abstracted and made them the center of the canvas and composition. This new way of visualizing art and objects radically changed artistic production.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1900-1945)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>WWI</li>
<li>Great Depression</li>
<li>WWII</li>
<li>Communism</li>
<li>Lost Generation displacement (fundamental ideas shaken)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p>Three main tendencies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abstraction, even nonrepresentational</li>
<li>Emphasis on physical processes, materials</li>
<li>Questioning how art has been done, new techniques and materials, including ordinary, “non-artistic” materials</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1903: Salon d’Autumne (reaction against conservative artistic values of French Royal Academy)</li>
<li>1913: Armory Show introduced modern art to America</li>
<li>Gallery 291: exhibited photographs by paintings</li>
<li>Avant-garde: new and cutting edge</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> moved cities into utopias. This new age demanded new styles of architecture. Industrialism triumphed. Classicism was rejected.</p>

<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Prairie Style</strong> gets its name from its long horizontal lines, inspired by the prairies and plains. <strong>Fallingwater </strong>is integrated into the landscape, horizontal lines, horizontal windows, restraint in decoration and a stacked quality.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> called this his “organic architecture,” inspired by Transcendentalism. Most materials came from the site or broader area.  It is central and natural with an <strong>in situ </strong>stone core for the fireplace.</p>
<p>The color palette is limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>light ochre (yellowy tan)</li>
<li>“Cherokee red” based on natural rock color</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <strong>liberal use of glass</strong>. The house has no walls facing the waterfall. <strong>Corner-turning windows</strong> do not use mullions and create unbroken views of nature. <strong>Elongated horizontal windows</strong> encourage the viewer to look outside.</p>
<p>The architecture creates the Illusion that the stream flows through the house. The powerful falls is heard from every room.</p>
<p>The <strong>ceilings are low</strong> reaching only up to 6 feet and 4 inches.  This encourages you to move towards the windows for the feeling of openness.</p>
<p>The <strong>floor is polished with wax</strong> to give it the appearance of wetness.</p>
<p>The house is darkest at the entrance and gets lighter as you move towards the back by the windows.</p>
<p>The use of <strong>cantilever</strong> construction allowed <strong>Wright</strong> to hang the house over the falls. Cantilever is a long projecting beam that has reinforcing wire-mesh and steel bars embedded inside of it to increase tensile strength. He used reinforced concrete or <strong>ferroconcrete.</strong></p>
<p>Edgar Kaufmann Sr, the Pittsburgh department store tycoon, commissioned <strong>Wright</strong> to build <strong>Fallingwater.</strong> Kaufmann sent a copy of <strong>Wright’s</strong> blueprints to his personal engineer who found the ground of <strong>Fallingwater</strong> unstable and dimensions of the cantilever untenable. He did not recommend that <strong>Wright </strong>proceed with the house. The architect was upset but permitted an increase in the number and diameter of the structure’s steel reinforcements.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This was created as a <strong>private home</strong> and weekend retreat for the Kaufmann family.</p>
<p>The clients were very interested in modern art and <strong>Wright’s</strong> work. It was <strong>a sign of status</strong> to have a weekend home.</p>

<p>The house was <strong>designed to be in harmony with nature</strong>. It is not just plunked down on top of the waterfall. It looks like it has grown out organically. It tumbles downward and outward like the waterfall itself.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The mid 1930s were bad years for American architecture. It was the time of the <strong>Great Depression</strong>. Almost no private homes were built.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> and his wife were struggling to keep Taliesin, his studio/home, out of foreclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> was also being viewed by his contemporaries as “out of style”. In a review of architecture in 1932, he was criticized for his “unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries”.</p>
<p>Philip Johnson, the designer of the Seagram Building, would call <strong>Wright</strong> the “greatest architect of the 19<sup>th</sup> century” to jab at how old and outdated he was.</p>
<p><strong>Wright </strong>developed an apprenticeship program called “the fellowship” to create business. Edgar Kaufmann Jr. was one of his first apprentices.</p>
<p>Kaufmann Sr. asked Wright about making a summer home for his family. They owned a large chunk of property in this area but the spot with the waterfall was their favorite.  <strong>Wright </strong>visited the site in December 1934. He rejected a conventional view of the waterfall and wanted to make the house a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Wright </strong>procrastinated for 9 months until Kaufmann Sr. called and said he was driving 140 miles to Taliesin to see what Wright had done.</p>
<blockquote><p>Apprentice Edgar Taffel said: <em>Wright briskly emerged from his office, sat down at the table with the plot plan and started to draw. The design just poured out of him. ‘Lilian and Edgar will have tea on the balcony…they’ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods…’ Pencils were being used up as fast as we could sharpen them. Erasures, overdrawing, modifying, flipping sheets back and forth. Then, the title across the bottom was scribbled: ‘Fallingwater.’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The whole process took two hours.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> was influenced by <strong>Transcendentalism</strong> meaning all nature and humanity are connected. He was also <strong>influenced by Japanese architecture</strong> and wanted to create harmony between man and nature.</p>

<p><strong>International Style</strong> was named that because its rational approach to design could be used universally. It was devised through the <strong>Five Points of Architecture,</strong> a universal system of architecture.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pilotis</strong>: slender columns (derived from classicism) to raise the building off the ground.</li>
<li>Two Roof terraces: bring nature into an urban setting.</li>
<li>Free and open floor plan.</li>
<li>Façade that is simple, smooth, unadorned, lacking ornamentation, white</li>

<p>The patrons were Pierre and Emilie Savoye. They believed in the benefits of fresh air and sunshine and considered outdoor time to be the mark of modern leisure. They wanted a home that <strong>integrated outdoor and indoor spaces. </strong></p>
<p>The home was designed to maximize pleasure and efficiency, while stripping away excess. This required minimal distractions and an integration of exterior and interior.</p>
<p>The home is in the Paris suburb to escape from crowded Paris.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Le Corbusier</strong> wanted to capture the essence of modern architecture. Therefore, he needed to use modern technologies. The architect looked to cars, ocean liners, factories, even grain silos to do so.</p>
<p>In 1929, he a wrote book entitled <strong><em>Toward an Architecture</em>. </strong>In it he argued that classical architecture when combined with ideas pulled from <strong>cars, airplanes and trains</strong> could be used to make modern homes. He said science, technology, rationalism, efficiency, leisure, cleanliness, and order helped to maximize leisure. Therefore, this should be the most important thing.</p>

<p>The Greeks created ideal and streamlined forms, beautiful in their simplicity. Think the Parthenon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Modern cars, airplanes and trains are also simple, beautiful, and efficient. They are streamlined, orderly, clean, and harmonious in their design. Therefore, a modern home, based on the objects of modernity should have all these same influences and qualities.</p>
<p>Le Corbusier wrote, “A house is a machine for living in.” This was a radical new idea of the domestic home.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>The Kiss</em></strong> by Austrian artist <strong>Gustav Klimt</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>5 feet 11 inches by 5 feet 11 inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art Nouveau</strong> means “New Art” with organic lines, simulating forms in nature and an emphasized on decorative patterns. <strong>Austrian Secession</strong> is highly ornate, decorative, fanciful, and feels dream-like or other worldly.  Here we see the beginnings of abstractions.</p>
<p><strong>Gold leaf</strong> was used on a highly decorative surface that creates both texture and reflection.</p>
<p>The larger male figure is characterized by square and rectangular forms.  The female form has soft lines and floral patterns with a rounded form.  The formal qualities such as patterning and repetition, make the space seem flat and as if there is no recession. The work ignores perspective, scale, space, modeling, and proportion.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a new avant-garde treatment of traditional subject matter. Lovers are quite common in art history, but these lovers don’t look anything like other lovers we have seen.  Think: <em>The Swing</em>. The artists rejected the Vienna art establishment.</p>

<p>The theme of lovers preoccupied <strong>Klimt</strong>. This shows love as an icon and something to be worshipped and adored. This illustrates a transcendent universal experience even in times of great change and modernization. The work is an ideal of what love can be.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is the <strong>theme of lovers</strong>, united through a kiss. They are embracing in a field of flowers which is reminiscent of fertility, and vibrancy. The man is bent over the woman, and she clings tightly to him as he kisses her. They are dangerously close to the edge of the precipice. This is likely due to the fin de siècle anxiety expressed through the danger and beauty of their passion.</p>
<p>The <strong>golden halo</strong> surrounds the couple, and unites them, as they are lost in the kiss</p>
<p>The <strong>man</strong> is physically powerful. We see the intensity of his desire. He is larger and dominates her. This is detailed, with <strong>rectangular and square forms</strong>. The <strong>woman</strong> is passively falling into his embrace. This is detailed with <strong>ovals and circles</strong>.</p>
<p>Love transports them out of our world.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Klimt &amp; Byzantine Influence</strong></h5>
<p>Klimt loved Byzantine art and had recently traveled to Ravenna to see San Vitale.</p>
<p>The background of <strong><em>The Kiss</em></strong> is flat and gold, unlike our world. This is like the Byzantine use of gold. They are transported to a sacred infinite world.</p>
<p><strong>Klimt</strong> follows tradition in the gender representations of the two figures&#8212;also Byzantine conventions, in this theme of lovers.</p>

<h5><strong>Fin de siècle</strong></h5>
<p>Fin de siècle or end of an era was at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century to 1914. Society changed rapidly during the late 19<sup>th</sup>early to the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The middle class was growing and so too was their wealth. This was characterized by decadence, excitement, extravagance. On the reverse this was also a time of anxiety and worry about increasing agitations across Europe.</p>
<p>Art became a form of escapism.</p>
<h5><strong>1897: Austrian Secession</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Austrian artists objected to the conservatism of the Vienna art establishment.</li>
<li>Klimt was the president of the Austrian Secessionists.</li>
<li>Created their own exhibition space to explore what art could be without the strictures of the academy.</li>
<li>Time of incredible innovation</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Austrian born artist, <strong>Gustav Klimt (1862-1918)</strong> is best known for his iconic painting, <strong><em>The Kiss</em></strong>.  He is famous for his “Golden Phase”, which culminated with this work.  It was Inspired by a visit to Ravenna during his travels through Italy in 1903 which introduced him to the world of Byzantine mosaics. Other inspirations were the medieval book covers with flat Gothic ornamentation and illuminated manuscripts.</p>
<p>Klimt was a sought-after portrait painter, who specialized in Viennese ladies. One such painting is <em>Portrait of Adele Bloche-Bauer</em> (1907), a painting, now with its own layered history, which sold at auction for more than $135 million, U.S., in 2006, exemplifies his stunning style, in fin-de-siecle Vienna.</p>
<blockquote><p>Art consumed Klimt and he was noted to have said, “Whoever wants to know something about me must observe my paintings carefully and try to see in them what I am.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Goldfish</em></strong> by French artist <strong>Henri Matisse</strong> is an oil on canvas work measuring <strong>4 feet 7 inches by 3 feet 2 inches.</strong>  Here, the artist shows interest in abstraction and simplifying all forms.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Fauvism?</strong></h5>
<p>Fauvism uses <strong>expressive, vibrant color in a non-realistic way</strong>. Placement of complementary colors in proximity makes them more active. On a color wheel, green, yellow, orange, red and purple are all in a row. This breaks with the traditional approach to color. Also note the bold brushwork.</p>
<p>There is an incorrect rendering of space. A study of ovals and circles, becomes flattened as they do not recede all at the same angle. This enables us to see the fish simultaneously from two different angles. It is not necessary to perfectly imitate reality.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>By depicting the goldfish and the water, Matisse captures <strong>a stereotypical Western view of an Arab paradise.</strong> He invites the viewer to indulge in the pleasure of watching the goldfish. He wanted art that would be <strong>soothing and calming</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the use of color in a new and vibrant way &#8211;like Gauguin.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>We see Matisse’s own garden furniture, plants, and fish tank.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Goldfish</strong> were introduced to Europe from East Asia in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Goldfish were a reoccurring subject in the work of <strong>Henri Matisse</strong>. He visited Morocco, in 1912, and noted how the local population would daydream for hours, gazing into fishbowls. People found them tranquil, entrancing and calming.</p>

<p><strong>Matisse</strong> admired Moroccans’ lifestyle which appeared to him to be relaxed and contemplative. This is a dangerous – but common – Western fantasy of Arab/Oriental life. We saw Ingres and Gauguin do this same thing.</p>

<p>The theme of paradise is prevalent. Even the name <strong><em>Goldfish</em></strong> defines these creatures as a shorthand for paradise and a golden age, with beautiful shimmering scales. Water is a common theme in Islamic art for cleansing, purifying, and tranquillity.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>French-born artist <strong>Henri Matisse</strong><strong> (1869 -1954) </strong>was known for his use of colour and his originality. Primarily known as a painter, he was also a sculptor, printmakers, and draftsman.</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait as a Soldier </em></strong>by German artist<strong> Ernst Ludwig Kirchner </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work <strong>measuring 2 feet 3 inches by 2 feet.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressionism</strong> is defined by the use of <strong>distorted, jagged forms</strong> and <strong>jarring colors</strong> <strong>for emotional impact</strong>.</p>
<p>The composition of this oil painting is tilted up and compressed. The perspective is strange with harsh colors. <strong>Greens, oranges, and yellows clash together</strong> in our mind. It causes a sense of instability, discord, and anxiety.</p>
<p>There are intense, harshly contorted forms, roughly sketched and stylized long. Angular forms are inspired by “primitive” African masks. Even the female nude is jarring and sharp…very different from Venus of Urbino.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>a self-portrait of Kirchner</strong> and an exploration of the artist’s personal fears. It focuses on his artistic failures and sexual impotency. It is his reckoning with his own weakness. His frustrations with his artistic, masculine, militaristic, and sexual inadequacy are captured.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kirchner is</strong> <strong>dressed in a military uniform</strong>. It is not in a military context however, as he is in his studio. There is a number 75 epaulets on his shoulders. This indicates his membership in the 75<sup>th</sup> Field Artillery Regiment. Symbols on his cap represent the German Reich.</p>
<p><strong>Kirchner</strong> appears sallow, harsh, edgy, angular, yellow, and sickly. He holds a limp cigarette in his mouth in reference to his physical and sexual inadequacies.</p>
<p><strong>Kirchner </strong>has an amputated arm that is bloody. This is a symbol of his inadequacies. The amputation is a metaphor for his “artist’s block”. He felt like he couldn’t create, and when he did, it was not well-received.</p>
<p>What about the nude that stands behind him almost like a statue? The figure is very different from the fleshy, attractive, inviting bodies we have seen in <strong>Venus of Urbino</strong> and <strong>La Grande Odalisque</strong>.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>Kirchner</strong> stands in his studio with everything he would need to make love and make art, and instead he can do neither.</p>
<h5><strong>A Timeline</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong>1905 </strong>Kirchner helped found the German Expressionist group <strong>Die Brücke</strong> (The Bridge). They believed they would be a bridge to the future. They promoted an entirely new way of being an artist. The focus was on distorted, jagged forms and color to display emotion.</p>
<p>Die Brücke artists were interested in “primitive” art, particularly from Africa. They believed “primitive” art was honest, direct, and purer than art from Western industrialized nations. Obviously, this is not a politically correct notion, but it had a huge impact on Expressionism. Die Brücke artists wanted to adopt the “natural” state they saw in “primitive” art.</p>
<p>In <strong>1913</strong> Die Brücke disbanded. It was two years before this painting was created.</p>
<p>In <strong>1914</strong> Kirchner volunteered to be a driver in WWI. He did this to avoid being drafted in a more dangerous combat role. He suffered a mental break down and was diagnosed as an alcoholic and barbiturate addict. He was discharged.</p>
<p>The artist returned to Berlin to paint but suffered a nervous breakdown again. Then, he lived in two mental institutions. He became severely addicted to alcohol and morphine. For a time, his hands and feet were paralyzed, and his limbs did not function as they should have.</p>
<p>Despite being well-received internationally (some argue he is as important, if not more so, than Picasso), <strong>his art was rejected by Hitler in the 1930s. </strong>Hitler persecuted artists who painted in a style that was outside of his “Aryan ideal”.</p>
<p><strong>The Degenerate Art Show in 1937</strong> was held by Hitler. He exhibited all modernist art he hated and 32 of the works were Kirchner’s. Hitler had over 600 of Kirchner’s works removed from public collections. Many were destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Kirchner shot and killed himself in July of 1938. </strong>He tried to get his girlfriend to do it with him. She refused and they had a huge fight. He went outside and shot himself in the heart.</p>

<p><strong><em>Improvisation 28 (second version)</em></strong>, by <strong>Wassily Kandinsky</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>3 feet by 6 inches and 5 feet and 3 inches. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>There is little to no discernible representation with a high amount of abstraction, but this is not pure, total abstraction.</p>
<p>Some characteristics of <strong>German Expressionism</strong> include <strong>brilliant clashing color</strong> as well as the use of <strong>color for its own sake</strong>. It is not there to mimic, describe or capture.</p>
<p><strong>Black diagonal lines</strong> are also characteristic. These crisscross and lead your eye across the painting. Look at the top left to bottom right. Then, to the bottom middle and to the top right to bottom right. This creates a sense of musicality and staccato.</p>
<p><strong>Automatism </strong>is letting the mind go and purely letting the hands control the artmaking. It is a very difficult process to use. <strong>Kandinsky</strong> tried but found that representation, narrative and content seeped back into the work.</p>
<p>The artist wanted the work to be mostly abstract because he believed if we recognized things too clearly that our conscious mind would take over the interpretation. We would then close off our emotional ability to respond to color.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>One of the first modern abstract (not purely abstract, though) artworks.</li>
<li>Uses abstraction to depict meaning (from St. John the Divine Book of Revelations) a relevant subject for a pre-WWI world.</li>
<li>Aimed to let his subconscious come out (automatism) but battled with the difficulty of suppressing narratives/content.</li>
<li>Explored the connections between music and art.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Improvisations:</strong> paintings which were inspired by “spiritual events”.</p>
<p><strong>Left side: Apocalypse</strong></p>
<p>Why did he select the apocalypse? Likely he saw a relation or connection to the chaotic times he lived in.</p>
<p><strong>On the top left</strong> there is a mountain. In the middle left there are cannons and smoke from a battlefield (atmospheric effects of smoke). On the bottom left there is a flood like the Old Testament flood. In the bottom middle, there are horses/riders of the apocalypse (a clever reference to Blue Rider name) through the curves of the manes and necks of the horses.</p>
<p><strong>The Right side: Salvation</strong></p>
<p>To the <strong>top right</strong> is a church on a hill. On the <strong>bottom right</strong>, figures are kissing.</p>
<h5><strong>In Comparison</strong></h5>
<p>Both Kandinsky’s <i>Improvisation 28</i> and <i>Bible </i><i>Moralisée</i> reveal St. John the Divine’s Book of Revelations (which discusses the Apocalypse).</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kandinsky</strong> was influenced by music, especially the composer Wagner, and he often named his paintings in musical terms. He associated his paintings with music and called all of them improvisations. He referred to his paintings as dissonant or a cacophony. These terms refer to sound.</p>
<p>It is believed <strong>Kandinsky </strong>had <strong>synesthesia</strong> (like Munch). This allowed him to see sound and hear color.</p>
<p><strong>Der Blaue Rider</strong> moves towards abstraction and simplified forms to see our world. It still uses still German Expressionist (vibrant color/jagged line) characteristics.</p>

<p><strong><em>Memorial Sheet for Karl Liebknecht</em></strong> is a<strong> woodcut </strong>work by artist<strong> Käthe Kollwitz, </strong>which measures<strong> 1 foot 2 inches by 1 foot 9 inches.  </strong></p>
<p>The artist first experimented with her creations. She tried first to make etchings, then lithographs. Then ultimately, she settled on woodcuts for which she is best known for. <strong>Kollwitz </strong>believed woodcuts captured the rough, vital energy needed for depicting horrors of war. Figures are made sharp and stark.</p>
<p>The composition is divided into <strong>three sections. </strong>The densely packed <strong>top level</strong> has well modeled faces. In the <strong>middle level</strong> one figure breaks between the barriers. The <strong>lowest level</strong> is contrasted with white and blackened faces. It is an inverted color scheme from the one she establishes up above. The contrast and emphasis let us see Liebknecht’s face.</p>
<h5><strong>German Expressionism </strong></h5>
<p><strong>German Expressionism</strong> has two main characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jagged, rough lines</li>
<li>Vivid, expressive colors</li>
</ul>
<p>While this work does not utilize color, it certainly has the rough, expressive, and splintered use of line.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>propaganda</strong> to ennoble, aggrandize, honor, and memorialize Liebknecht. <strong>Prints</strong> were able to produce multiple copies of the same image. This was cheap and easy to distribute. It was the ideal medium for spreading political statements.</p>
<p>After the death of Karl Liebknecht, his family asked <strong>Kollwitz</strong> to make a work to <strong>memorialize him</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>She had 2 sons join the army in WWI; one died; her work stagnated; she had lost passion</li>
<li>She had seen Liebknecht speak and admired his charisma, even though she was not a communist.</li>
<li>However, communists criticized her because she was not a communist herself.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>She defended herself, “As an artist, I have the right to extract emotional content out of anything.”</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Made in the style of the Lamentation, with Liebknecht as the Christ-like figure/martyr
<ul>
<li>Followers of Christ/Liebknecht mourning over their dead bodies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus is on common people – workers – affected by tragedy
<ul>
<li>Dignity, variety of working class</li>
<li>Mother and child (future generations affected)</li>
<li>Mourner’s hand connects to the chest of the martyred revolutionary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Text says: From living to dead memory; indicates he will live on as Christ did</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>About Liebknecht </strong></h5>
<p>In 1912, Liebknecht became a communist and was elected to the Reichstag (German Parliament). He was very opposed to WWI.</p>
<p>Liebknecht formed the Berlin Spartacus League which printed an illegal newspaper called the Spartacus Letters (from the name Spartacus after the slave who led a failed revolt against the Roman Army in 73 BCE). Spartacus League essentially became the German Communist party.</p>
<p>In 1916 the Spartacists called for an end to the war. Liebknecht was arrested and spent the rest of the war in prison. In 1918 he was released when amnesty was granted to all political prisoners.</p>
<p>In 1919 a German Revolution (aka Spartacus Revolt) was attempted. It was the Spartacus League vs. the government of Friedrich Elbert. The revolt was defeated with ease by Elbert’s Germany army.   Liebknecht was murdered, after being held in a hotel room, before being transported to prison.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kollwitz </strong>was the first woman accepted into the Prussian Academy of Arts (she received a studio, an income, and a professorship).</li>
<li>In political turmoil after WWI, many artists turn to prints as an ideal medium for spreading political statements.</li>
<li>German Expressionism grew as a reaction to WWI: exhibiting the disjointed, broken, jagged society that remained.</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Cubism (1907-1930s) </strong></h4>
<p>Cubism was inspired by Cézanne’s Post-Impressionistic works. The first Cubist painting was <strong><em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon </em></strong>created by <strong>Pablo Picasso. I</strong>t was Influenced by simple geometric African masks (primitivism) and Cézanne’s multiple views.</p>

<h5><strong>How can we think of Cubism?</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>A fragmentation of an object (or objects) into its <strong>most simple geometric shapes.</strong></li>
<li>Shatter an object. When you put it back together, twist and invert the various shards before reassembling. This allows you to see the object from <strong>multiple viewpoints. </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Goal #1:</strong> Can you simplify an object to its most basic geometric forms?</p>
<p><strong>Goal #2:</strong> Can you view an object from more than one side at once?</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Simple geometric shapes</li>
<li>Non-realistic colors</li>
<li>Space is flattened (perspective and lighting are not used to create realistic space)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Three phases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analytical (jagged; sharp; multifaceted)</li>
<li>Synthetic (collages; flattened)</li>
<li>Curvilinear (flowing; rounded)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</em></strong> by Spanish artist <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong> is a painting using <strong>oil on canvas</strong>.  It measures <strong>8 feet by 7 feet 8 inches</strong>. This work fully explores abstraction and marks a radical break from traditional composition and perspective in painting.</p>
<p>The space comes towards us in jagged shards. The <strong>figures are aggressively abstracted</strong> into sharp geometric forms. The limbs seem at times dislocated. The figures do not have rounded volume, instead, they are splintered. There is no modeling as that would have created the illusion of roundness. The space is radically compressed and flattened, like a still life.</p>
<p>Do not let the rough painting and jagged form make you think this was quick. The result took over 100 sketches.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Picasso continued to <strong>examine the female nude</strong>, as artists have done throughout western art history. He created his <strong>personal fantasy</strong> by playing on the reclining female nude with not one but five women.</p>
<p>He also had anxiety about sleeping with prostitutes. There was considerable anxiety over life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, pleasure was linked to morality in an era before antibiotics.</p>
<p>Here he created his version of <strong>Cubism</strong>. This was a new visual style in art.</p>
<p>Picasso’s intense <strong>competitive nature</strong> drove him to outdo his rivals (Matisse) and role models (Cezanne).</p>

<h5><strong>Audience Response</strong></h5>
<p>The viewers responded with complete confusion, and disgust. They felt he had butchered historical art traditions. What possible reason could there be for this?</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The title is in reference to a famed Avignon Street in Barcelona which <strong>Picasso</strong> frequented.</p>
<p>The work is of <strong>five prostitutes</strong>.  The women stare directly at the viewer. This builds on what Olympia had done for art.  <strong><em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon </em></strong>replaces sensual eroticism of traditional female nudes, with aggressively crude pornography. Notice the figure squatting in the lower right.</p>
<p>The faces are splintered and inspired by African masks. Two women push aside curtains, while the others strike seductive and erotic poses. We see that this has become a show for <strong>Picasso.</strong></p>
<p>Originally, the work contained two men, but he removed them. Why? If men were present, women would attend to them. If there were no men, <strong>Picasso</strong> was their focus. Viewers become the customers.</p>
<h5><strong>Desirable vs. Dangerous</strong></h5>
<p>Picasso frequently went to brothels. Across Europe, there was a growing public health crisis, with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.  Prostitutes were beginning to be seen as intriguing, and desirable, but dangerous. Getting an STD could literally kill you.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Faces were <strong>influenced by Primitivism and African masks</strong> that Picasso had collected. France was still a major colonial power in Africa. Many African artworks were taken and sold in Paris.</p>

<p>The work was also <strong>inspired by Archaic statuary</strong> (Anavysos Kouros). The figure on the far left shows this (one leg forward, arm down by side). Picasso had recently seen an exhibition of archaic sculpture at the Louvre.</p>
<h5><strong>Pablo Picasso</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)</strong> contributed to many art movements including Surrealism, Neoclassicism and Expressionism. He was a founder of Cubism, along with artist George Braque.  Picasso’s paintings often included dominant colours, like the Blue Period or Rose Period. Picasso not only painted, but he also created prints, drawings, sculpture, ceramics, and even set and costume designs for ballet.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Portuguese </em></strong>by <strong>Georges Braque</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>3 feet 8 inches by two feet and six inches. </strong>The work takes the 400 years of Renaissance tradition&#8211;form, color, space, perspective, modeling, recession&#8211; and throws it away!</p>
<h5><strong>The Goals of Cubism</strong></h5>
<p>Instead of a single vantage point, the viewer sees the painting from <strong>many angles.</strong> The fixed point of view is gone. Cubism breaks an object down to its basic geometric forms.</p>
<p>Letters added to <strong><em>The Portuguese </em></strong>make the viewer aware of the flat surface of the painting. It reminds us that the painting is <strong>a constructed object</strong> rather than an illusion to reality.  This is an <strong>experimentation</strong> with perspective, and a total flattening of space. It occupies multiple vantage points. Depth is limited.</p>
<p>The monochromatic color palette <strong>emphasizes structure over color</strong>. This contrasts with Fauves and Post-Impressionists.  There is no consistent light source, but a variety of shadows over the picture plane.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>There is an ambiguity of a clear, distinctive reading of the image. The central goal is to attempt to show <strong>numerous viewpoints</strong> simultaneously. <strong>This is a complete change!</strong> All other works, despite stylistic differences, viewed objects from the front.</p>
<p>This fragmentation leads to multiple viewpoints. It reduces figures into basic geometric forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The guitar player on a dock was recreated from the memories of a Portuguese musician the artist saw years before, in a bar in Marseilles. It is totally broken in form, with large intersecting planes.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Braque</strong> was originally a Fauve who found it so challenging that he began to rethink his own style</li>
<li>Formed cubism with Picasso in 1907-1908</li>
</ul>
<p>The work was inspired by</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Cezanne’s flattening and abstraction</li>
<li>Primitivism’s interest in abstraction</li>
<li>Fragmentation of pre-WWI society</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>WWI was so destructive to society and European ideals that many felt it had been splintered and shattered. Cubism takes this idea and applies it to art.</li>
</ul>
<h4>In Comparison <strong>   </strong></h4>
<p>Previously, the Renaissance taught us paintings were illusionistic and three-dimensional, as they were dubbed “windows into the world.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-454" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71-Madonna-and-Child-with-Two-Angels.jpg?resize=204%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="204" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71-Madonna-and-Child-with-Two-Angels.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71-Madonna-and-Child-with-Two-Angels.jpg?w=223&amp;ssl=1 223w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Cezanne began to experiment with flattening, simplifying and breaking down. What happens when I paint something that is 3D, but I paint in on something 2D and I emphasize its 2D nature?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1521" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/125..jpg?resize=300%2C242&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="242" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/125..jpg?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/125..jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Braque now embraces this notion of flatness. We have not only flattened the guitar player; we have simplified him, shattered him and in gluing him back together, we have jumbled him up.</p>

<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Georges Braque</strong> (1882-1963) was a French born painter and sculptor. He is best known for being a founder of Cubism, along with Picasso. Some of his other masterpieces include <em>Piano and Mandola, Violin and Palette, Woman with Mandolin, and Women with a Guitar.</em></p>
<p>The artist even designed costumes for Ballets Russes and other companies in the 1920s to 1950s.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> De Stijl Themes: abstraction</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Kunsthaus in Zurich</p>
<p><strong><em>Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow </em></strong><em>by Dutch artist</em> <strong>Piet Mondrian </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 1 foot 6 inches by 1 foot 6 inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>De Stijl</strong> is the Dutch for “the style”. It moves towards absolute pure abstraction. There is an asymmetrical balance and total flatness. The image is simplified and non-representational. There is absolute abstraction without any reference to objects in nature.</p>
<p>The painting has no individual brushstrokes. This is very difficult to do.</p>
<p><strong><em>Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow </em></strong>uses pure primary colours of white, black, red, blue and yellow. It is abstracted to basic vertical and horizontal elements</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The goal was to create a relevant, new art style with the power to unite people. As a result of WWI, people had been so torn apart that they needed something to unite them.</p>
<p>Mondrian felt that pure abstraction was the only relevant, clear, and universal language. This could create the harmony and order the world needed this after WWI.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Primary colors and white and black</li>
<li>Black grid that creates squares and rectangles of white, blue, red, and yellow</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Art needed to reflect a greater universal truth as this was in question after WWI. Art needed to be accessible to everyone and free of cultural association.</p>
<p>Imagine <em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em> or Ndop figure. Depending on your cultural background, you can easily interpret those images or at least get the basic message. However, if it is not familiar to you, you must be taught.</p>
<p>What is the only thing that everyone universally can understand? Formalism and abstraction because there is no message to understand. That is the unifying power of abstraction.</p>
<p>If art is going to be relevant, it must change to become universal.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Piet Mondrian (1872-1944)</strong> was one of the founders of the Dutch modern movement De Stijl. He reduced his shapes to lines and rectangles and worked with a minimal color palette. He is best known for his work in the 1920s and 30s.</p>

<h4><strong>Modern Sculpture</strong></h4>

<p><strong><em>The Kiss </em></strong>by artist<strong> Constantin Brancusi </strong>is a<strong> stone sculpture</strong> measuring<strong> 1 foot 10 inches tall. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a subtractive sculpture-in-the-round.</strong> It has no negative space. The emphasis is on the original/starting shape of the block of stone. This is an <strong>abstraction</strong> of human bodies.</p>
<p>The <strong>right angles of the elbows</strong> align with and emphasize the block. A single incised line separates the two figures. This leaves the block very raw. Its <strong>emphasis is on cubic quality and the rough surface</strong>. This was radical. Donatello, Michelangelo, Houdon – emphasized the technical finish. Rodin began to “roughen” up sculpture, and this was a total disregard of academic finish.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>not on a pedestal</strong> and is meant to be directly on the ground. This takes the sculpture out of the academic realm.</p>
<p>This work is a <strong>manipulation of the human body</strong> to fit form, rather than to fit style.</p>
<p>It is a <strong>rejection of academic tradition</strong>: idealization, finish, scale, size, and pedestal.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>1) Redefine sculpture and start where his teacher Rodin left off</li>
<li>2) Reject authority and strictures of the academy</li>
<li>3) Be inspired by primitivism</li>
<li>4) Show a modern take on a traditional subject (lovers)</li>
<li>5) Attempt to maintain the materiality of the stone (make content fit form, not content fit style)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Two half-length figures who hold each other tight in an embrace</li>
<li>Emphasis is on the union of these two figures</li>
<li>Female figure: longer hair, slight suggestion of breasts, eye is smaller</li>
<li>Just like Klimt’s version – in terms of the union of the figures</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) </strong>was not technically a cubist, but he was inspired by Cubism. He was a student of Rodin’s.  The mentor broke rules about the idealization of sculptural figures. He took issue with the classical ideal.</p>
<p><strong>Brancusi</strong> took what his teacher did a step further. <strong>Brancusi</strong> was an outsider to modernism (like Munch as a Norwegian was). He was Romanian and went to the Academy in Bucharest.</p>
<p><strong>Brancusi </strong>was inspired by primitivism (African art), as well as Assyrian and Egyptian art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Dada (1916-1925)</strong></h4>
<p>Dada was the result of WWI’s chaos and despair</p>
<p>Dada is a nonsense word that was “sufficiently insignificant to satisfy the Dadaists’ contempt for significance”.</p>
<p>Artists united in their horror of the war and the disgust for the societies responsible. They made arts that was absurd because they thought life was absurd. It was intentional mockery.</p>

<p>Toilet was a <strong>found object</strong>: artist appropriates it, choice to do this makes it art.</p>
<p>This is known as a <strong>readymade</strong>, a commonplace object selected and exhibited as a work of art. The artist has had to do little as the work was made ready.</p>
<p>The ONE THING that had united ALL other works is that an artist’s hand made it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Duchamp said, “Why is art more about craft than vision?”</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Here, art is a transformation of ordinary materials into something that makes us see things in a new way</p>
<p>Duchamp said this is what happens with pigments, roots, and oil. It is mixed up as paint and depicts an image. He questioned why was what he was doing so terribly wrong?</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s art because I said so,” said Marcel Duchamp. By saying this he illustrated the power of the artist to create a new thought and new purpose to an object.</p></blockquote>
<p>Duchamp rejected the assumption that art must be linked to the craft of the hand. Instead, he said art should be about an idea.</p>
<p>What is art, after all?</p>
<p>Does it have to be made by the hand of the artist?</p>
<p>Can the artist just have an idea and put that idea into action?</p>
<p>This work designates a lowly object as a work of art. It makes the viewer ask, what can be considered art? He INTENDED for this to be absurd, to demonstrate the societal constructions about art.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’ve done everything as other artists did it, yet people will say this isn’t art.” Marcel Duchamp.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>What Do We See? </strong></h5>
<p>He turned the urinal on its side and placed it on a pedestal (wooden block). This undermined its utilitarian associations and uses sculptural traditions of aggrandizement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pun: fountain spots liquid, a urinal is meant to collect it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>We certainly wouldn’t want to drink from this…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He signed it R. Mutt 1917, and named it a Fountain (a nonsense name based on Mott Ironworks where he bought the urinal)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Dada </strong>was an art movement in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. It arose as a reaction to WWI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Artwork/poetry/performances are often nonsensical and absurd</li>
<li>Intentional mockery of society and conventions</li>
</ul>
<p>After moving from Paris to NYC in 1915, <strong>Duchamp </strong>became a founding member of the <strong>American Society of Independent Artists (ASIA)</strong>, a group dedicated to advancing new art forms. He was the director.</p>
<p>The group <strong>tackled the problem of juried art shows</strong>.  Juries always selected traditional works. Artists had to be selected to show art, ASIA wanted to promote new possibilities.</p>
<p>The 1917 Show was advertised as “No Jury – No Prizes. They planned to accept all works. The entrance fee was $80.  This was to <strong>encourage nontraditional works</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Duchamp</strong> submitted this urinal as sculpture and paid the $80 fee. It inspired a heated debate amongst the board and was rejected an hour before the opening. Remember <strong>Duchamp</strong> was the director! He resigned immediately in protest.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>French American artist Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968) produced paintings, sculpture, and short films. He was associated not only with Dadaism, but Cubism and Surrealism.</p>
<h4><strong>Surrealism (1920s-1940s)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Surrealism </strong>was influenced by Dada and began as a literary movement.  It grew out of Freudian free-association and dream analysis. Then there was automatic writing, word games, and hypnotic trances.</p>
<p>The goal was liberating the individual unconscious. Automatism worked in creating without conscious control.</p>
<p>Surrealism was meant to puzzle or challenge the viewer.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Two Fridas </em></strong>by Mexican artist <strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 5 feet 7 inches by 5 feet 7 inches. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Surrealism</strong> is meant to puzzle or challenge the viewer. It often shows dream–like scenes with a psychological focus. This double self-portrait is in a Surrealist, unclear, confusing space. The space is flat, with an even balance, split evenly up and down, with a focus on the foreground.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychological</strong>: examines her inner feelings as a self-portrait study</li>
<li>Surrealists want to examine inner states, psychological states of mind</li>
<li>Reveals the deep hurt over losing her husband, her culturally mixed heritage, the harsh reality of her medical conditions, and the repression of women</li>
<li>Shows the ultimately conflicted personal feelings of Frida</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Two seated figures hold hands and share a bench in front of a stormy sky. They are <strong>identical twins except for their attire.</strong></p>
<p>On the <strong>left side</strong>, rejected Frida wears <strong>Victorian/German clothing</strong>. She has a clamping vein, and her blouse is ripped open to reveal her weak and exposed heart. There is a sense of vulnerability.</p>
<p>On the <strong>right side</strong>, Rivera still loves her. Frida’s heart is still whole. She wears the <strong>indigenous dress</strong> that Rivera preferred her to wear. The vein feeds his portrait. Her heart is strong and secure. Her skin is darker.</p>
<p>She is both women at once. They are linked through blood and gesture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where one is weakened by an exposed heart (L), the other is strong (R).</li>
<li>Where one still pines for her lost love (R), the other clamps down on that (L)</li>
<li>Blood is a metaphor of union</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>F</strong><strong>rida Kahlo (1907-1954)</strong> was a mostly untrained painter who found refuge from pain throughout her life in art. She painted almost 200 self-portraits.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Two Fridas </em></strong>was completed during her divorce from Diego Rivera.</p>
<p>She married Rivera in 1929. They each had affairs. Kahlo’s affairs were with men and women.</p>
<p>Kahlo’s father was German, and her mother was Mexican. Rivera encouraged her to abandon her Germanic/Western heritage and wear traditional Mexican clothing instead.</p>
<p>In an era when women wore elaborate hairstyles and clothing, Kahlo was a rebellious loner who wore indigenous clothing and did not shave. This was seen as very transgressive. During this time most women were domestic housewives. Kahlo was a businesswoman and artist.</p>
<p>In her paintings she often depicted physical deformities. She had polio as a child, which deformed her right leg. A bus accident when she was 18 caused her to be impaled through her groin which left her unable to walk for many months. Ultimately, she was unable to have children. She had severe scarring and deformity of the uterus. As a result, she underwent 32 operations. All these things challenged the definition of femininity.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Surrealism’s love of alchemy is revealed by turning something cool, smooth, ceramic, and metal into something warm, furry, and bristly.</p>
<p>This work has taken something utilitarian and turned it into a sculptural work. In a way, this is like a readymade!</p>
<p><strong>Oppenheim stresses the physicality of the object</strong>, like Brancusi’s <em>Kiss.</em> It retains its original starting shape.</p>
<p>Imagine the feeling of the fur while drinking from the cup and using the saucer and spoon. How is this different than viewing a Renaissance or other work? The point is the viewer experiences the work. They think through what it would be like.</p>
<p>The form of this work is familiar to us, but the experience is not. Fur imbues these functional, hand-held objects with sexual connotations. Transformed genteel items traditional associated with female decorum into sensuous, sexually punning tableware. A small concave object covered in fur, that you put warm liquid into and is meant to be in your mouth…</p>
<h5><strong>A Note</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Oppenheim </strong>herself said her work was not meant to have a sexual interpretation. She was very frustrated by this. She believed this interpretation was only because she was female, and she stopped producing art for a number of years.</p>
<h5><strong>The Hallmark of Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>However, Surrealist interpretations vary and morph. This is believed to be a fair evaluation and the “way it worked”. It was thought that when a Surrealist artist makes their artwork and then displays it, the public has the right to make interpretations of it. This is a hallmark of Symbolism.</p>
<h5><strong>The Original Title</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Oppenheim’s</strong> title was <strong><em>Object,</em></strong> but another Surrealist took the liberty of adding to the title: <strong><em>Le Dejeneur en fourrure</em> (Luncheon in Fur)</strong> a sexual connotation for oral sex.</p>
<p>This is a play on Manet’s infamous Impressionist painting <strong><em>Luncheon on the Grass</em></strong> and a famous erotic novel <strong><em>Venus in Furs.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>A 22-year-old <strong>Meret Oppenheim</strong> was with Pablo Picasso and his mistress Dora Maar in a café. Oppenheim was wearing a brass bracelet covered in fur. Picasso, admiring it, proclaimed “Anything can be covered in fur!” Oppenheim replied, “Even this cup and saucer!”</p>
<p>Another version is that she commented her tea needed a fur coat to keep it warm.</p>
<p><em>When she finished <strong>Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure),</strong> she submitted it for an exhibition of Surrealist artworks, in Paris. Many declared it a quintessential Surrealist object.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>The Jungle,</em></strong> by Cuban artist<strong> Wifredo Lam </strong>is a<strong> gouache on paper, mounted on canvas artwork </strong>measuring<strong> 8 feet by 8 feet.  </strong>Gouache is an opaque watercolor.</p>
<p>The forms are highly <strong>stylized and abstracted</strong>. Note the crescent-shaped faces, cloddish hands, feet, and long thin bodies. The color palette features <strong>blues, greens, oranges, and whites </strong>like in a jungle<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>There is <strong>an uneasy balance</strong> between the composition’s denser top and the more open bottom. There are not enough feet and legs to support all the figures in the top half.</p>
<p>The <strong>unorthodox landscape</strong> excludes the horizon line, sky, or wide view. Instead, it is tight and cluttered.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This is the artist’s <strong>emotional representation of the history of slavery</strong> in Lam’s native Cuba. It also illustrates how he thinks contemporary Cubans are viewed by Westerners as exotic and primitive. He uses stereotypes to combat stereotypes. This draws attention to the issues to oppression of Afro-Cubans and the harmful nature of Western stereotypes of the region.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1844" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/142.-Cuba-Picture.jpg?resize=405%2C638&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="405" height="638" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/142.-Cuba-Picture.jpg?w=573&amp;ssl=1 573w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/142.-Cuba-Picture.jpg?resize=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1 190w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Lam argues Afro-Cuban culture has been reduced to an absurdity, of both the exotic and primitive.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong></h5>
<p>The figures with <strong>crescent-shaped faces</strong> like African/Pacific masks, are in a landscape of Cuban sugarcane fields.  Lam often utilized symbols of Afro-Cuban culture, particularly Santeria (mix of Catholicism and African spirituality). In Santeria, the supernatural merges with the natural world through masks and animals. The figures are human, animal, and mystical all at once.</p>
<p>At <strong>the top right</strong>, the furthest figure holds a pair of shears in reference to harvesting.</p>
<p>To call it <strong><em>The Jungle</em></strong> suggests a search for a primitive culture. We are not in an urban or civilized area, but an untamed wilderness. Lam paints <strong>sugarcane and tobacco</strong> which are domesticated plants. Sugarcane is alien to the jungle setting, rather, it is grown in fields.</p>
<p>So why the Jungle? It captures the exotic, wild Western fantasy of tropical Cuba and reduces its inhabitants to strange, mystical hybrids who are not fully “civilized”.</p>
<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>Originally enslaved by Spanish and Portuguese traders, Africans were forced to work sugarcane fields and convert to Catholicism. Africans continued to practice their native religion in the safety of jungles and fields.</p>
<p>In the 1940s in Cuba, <strong>sugarcane</strong> was big business. It required the toil of thousands of laborers. The reality of Cubans engaged in hard labor was in sharp contrast to how foreigners experienced the island as a tropical playground. While Americans enjoyed Cuba as a resort experience, US corporations ran their sugar businesses. The US controlled Cuban policies for decades.</p>
<p>Lam painted this after returning to Cuba from a trip to Europe where he was introduced to <strong>Surrealism. </strong>Surrealists aimed to unleash the unconscious mind. This freed things that have been suppressed. It brought with it dream-like distortions.</p>
<h4><strong>About the Artist</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Wifredo Lam </strong>(1902-1982) was a Cuban artist and the grandson of an Afro-Cuban slave. His father was a Chinese immigrant who came to Cuba.</p>

</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a <strong>dream-like</strong> depiction of the <strong>true history of the people of Mexico</strong>. The artist believed history is written by the victors, and thus depicts an incomplete story. <strong>Rivera</strong> depicts stories typically written out of history. He deliberately includes <strong>people of all classes</strong>.</p>
<p>This work is painted in the Versailles restaurant of the Hotel Prado, a government hotel next to Alameda Park.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is supposed to capture a dream-like fantasy of Mexican history. Since dreams are so strange, <strong>Rivera</strong> can juxtapose a variety of subject matter together.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rivera</strong> often painted frescos that <strong>celebrated the indigenous history of Mexico and socialism.  </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>original work had a sign</strong> painted into it that said, <strong>“God does not exist”.</strong> In a deeply Catholic country, the accusation that God did not exist caused an uproar. Also, this was not what people expected to find in an upscale government hotel. <strong>Viewers protested the sign</strong>. The Mexican archbishop would not bless the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>The painting was attacked. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Rivera</strong> refused to change it, so it was hidden, until 1956.  Then Rivera agreed to alter it.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Early 20<sup>th</sup> century photography</p>

Appropriation<br />

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Metropolitan and Getty have copies</p>
<p><strong><em>The Steerage </em></strong>by <strong>Alfred Stieglitz </strong>is a<strong> photogravure.</strong></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, a <strong>photogravure</strong> is not a photograph, because the image isn&#8217;t made in a darkroom.  The <strong>negative is transferred onto a copper plate coated with gelatin</strong>. The plate is <strong>dipped in a succession of etching acid baths</strong>, which eat away at the darker areas of the plate which have more gelatin. Next, the artist <strong>prints the image with ink.</strong></p>
<p>Why would you use this? It is <strong>one of the best methods to mass produce large editions of photographs</strong> that are good quality. They have a very sensual velvety feel.</p>
<p>This is a study of composition, shape, rhythm, value, and line. Photography can capture abstraction in the same manner that painting can.</p>
<p>The artist explains:</p>
<p><em>A round straw hat, the funnel leading out, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railings made of circular chains – white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape.</em></p>
<p><em> I stood spellbound for a while, looking and looking. Could I photograph what I felt, looking and looking and still looking? I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life. […] </em></p>
<p><em>Spontaneously I raced to the main stairway of the steamer, chased down to my cabin, got my Graflex, raced back again all out of breath, wondering whether the man with the straw hat had moved or not. If he had, the picture I had seen would no longer be. The relationship of shapes as I wanted them would have been disturbed and the picture lost.</em></p>
<p><em>But there was the man with the straw hat. He hadn’t moved. The man with the crossed white suspenders showing his back, he too, talking to a man, hadn’t moved. And the woman with a child on her lap, sitting on the floor, hadn’t moved. Seemingly, no one had changed position. […] [It] would be a picture based on related shapes and on the deepest human feeling, a step in my own evolution, a spontaneous discovery.</em></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Stieglitz’s</strong> function was to argue for the <strong>elevation of photography to a fine art</strong>. It was an argument for <strong>photography’s merits. </strong>The <strong>emphasize was on how photography is different than painting. </strong></p>
<p>Considered the first modernist photograph – why? Prior to this, photographers had tried to always emulate painting (think of <em>Still Life in Studio</em>).</p>
<p>Photography’s strengths are clarity and realism. This was the first photo that did not aim to emulate painting in style and subject matter.</p>
<p>There was an unintended function. It became associated with Documentary Photography and journalism. It also conveyed a message about its subjects and immigrants, even though this wasn’t Stieglitz’s intent.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Upper and lower-class immigrants and travelers together on a boat</li>
<li>Formal arrangements of diagonals, colors, tones</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Stieglitz </strong>ran an art gallery and published many art journals, that focused on photography</p>
<p>He was familiar with the debates about immigration reform and the ghastly conditions that steerage passengers were subjected to. Interestingly, Stieglitz, the son of a German immigrant, was opposed to admitting the uneducated and marginal to the USA.</p>
<p>Stieglitz’s wife Emmeline and their daughter were going to France. Emmeline was from a wealthy family, and Stieglitz was very class-conscious. Here is what he had to say about it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>How I hated the atmosphere of the first class on that ship. One couldn’t escape the &#8216;nouveau riches.&#8217; [&#8230;] On the third day out I finally couldn’t stand it any longer. I had to get away from that company. I went as far forward on the deck as I could [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p><em> As I came to the end of the desk I stood alone, looking down. There were men and women and children on the lower deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading up to the upper deck of the steerage, a small deck at the bow of the steamer. To the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage deck there was fastened a gangway bridge which was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone. On the upper deck, looking over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck. Only men were on the upper deck. The whole scene fascinated me.  </em></p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>Theme for Realism: “Reaction Against Romanticism”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Realism and Realist artists</strong> called for a widespread rejection of Romanticism. Instead, they favored what were accurate and “objective” depictions of the ordinary world.</p>
<h3><strong>Theme for Impressionism: “Modern Life”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Impressionism</strong>, emerging in Napoleon III’s remodeling of Paris, focused on contemporary scenes of Parisian middle class life – strolls in the parks, going to the opera, walking down city streets, reading, and similar past-times.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1850-1900)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Positivism: Faith in all knowledge which would derive from science and scientific objective methods which could solve all human problems. Man’s problems CAN be solved and improved.</li>
<li>Karl Marx and class struggle:
<ul>
<li>Economic forces based on class struggle induced historical change.</li>
<li>Constant opposition between those who controlled the means of production (bourgeoisie) and those whose labor was exploited to benefit the wealthy and powerful (proletariat).</li>
<li>Marx&#8217;s goal of creating a socialist state appealed to the laboring classes and many intellectuals and gave rise to trade unions and socialist groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>La Belle Époque and Napoleon III’s renovations of Paris</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Societal changes prompted greater consciousness of and interest in modernity.</li>
<li>Development of Modernism</li>
<li>Two major modernist art movements of the later 19th century are Realism and Impressionism</li>
<li>Modernism led to the development of the avant-garde (artists whose work emphatically rejected the past and transgressed the boundaries of conventional artistic practice)</li>
<li>In 1863 Napoleon III granted the Académie Royale des Peinture et Sculpture independence from the government, changing the name to L&#8217;École des Beaux-Arts.</li>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Late Romantic (Mexican) painting</p>
<p><strong>Themes</strong>:</p>

Propaganda<br />
Nature</p>
<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Museo Nacional del Arte, Mexico City</p>
<p><strong><em>The Valley of Mexico from the Hillside of Santa Isabel</em></strong> by Mexican artist<strong> Jose María Velasco</strong> is <strong>an oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>4 feet 6 inches by 7 feet 4 inches.</strong></p>
<p>The canvas is large, making it a landscape elevated to the traditions of a history painting. The deep space lends a monumental quality to the landscape. It has a dramatic perspective and vista. Notice the atmospheric perspective used. Higher horizon allows us to see more of the land and a focus on nature. The human figures are small.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This work highlights the <strong>connection between landscapes and patriotism</strong> in Mexico. It helped to define the Mexican identity, not just to the Mexican people, but globally, as this was exhibited at the World’s Fair.</p>
<h5><strong>The Perfect Landscape</strong></h5>
<p>A popular <strong>Romantic landscape</strong> was known as a <strong>pastoral idyll</strong>.  It was where poetic harmony and daily life united.</p>
<h5><strong>Aztec Historical Elements</strong></h5>
<p>The white peaks of <strong><em>The Valley of Mexico from the Hillside of Santa Isabel</em></strong> are the Popocatepetl and Iztacchihuatl volcanoes, that are prominent Aztec volcanoes. The subject is of the legendary love story between an Aztec princess and warrior. This is symbolized by the mountains.</p>
<p>Lake Texcoco is the lake where the Aztecs settled. The island in the lake is Tenochtitlan.</p>
<h5><strong>Catholic Elements</strong></h5>
<p>The middle ground in the painting illustrates Catholic history. The artist’s hometown is located at the foot of the small hill. This same hill was the site where the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego.</p>
<h5><strong>Modern Indigenous Historical Elements</strong></h5>
<p>In the painting the human forms are an Indigenous family in their landscape. The clothing connects them to Mexican heritage. The mother with children shows the future of Mexico.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, the first art school in Latin America was established in Mexico City. The Royal Academy of San Carlos was modeled after the Art Academy of San Fernando, in Madrid, which fostered Romantic and Neoclassical aesthetics.</p>
<p>After The Mexican War for Independence in 1810-1821 (from Spain), Mexico used art to establish its national identity (just like what Americans tried to do with the George Washington statue).</p>
<h5><strong>Comparisons</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Romantic</strong> landscapes were used as popular subjects to express patriotism and national identity</p>

<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jose María Velasco (1840-1912)</strong> was one of Mexico’s most accomplished landscape painters.  He trained at the Royal Academy of San Carlos, where he learned Romanticism and was encouraged to paint Mexican landscapes. During his career, he won numerous prizes and awards in national and international competitions.</p>
<h4>Early French Photography</h4>

<p><strong><em>Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art</em></strong> a work by French born artist<strong> Honoré Daumier </strong>is a<strong> lithograph.</strong></p>
<p><strong>N</strong><strong>OTE: </strong>Clearly this is not a photograph, however, it is grouped here so that we can continue to think about photographic developments throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p><strong>Lithograph </strong>(what Daumier used)</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeps the sketchy, “drawing-like” quality that cannot be captured in a woodcut, engraving, or etching and makes this reproducible like a print.</li>
<li>Hinges on the principal that water and oil cannot mix.</li>
<li>An image is drawn onto a stone slab with an oily crayon.</li>
<li>Water is then rolled over the stone.</li>
<li>The oily crayon repels the water, and the stone absorbs the water because it is porous.</li>
<li>Oil is rolled over the stone. The oil adheres to the oily crayon but is repelled from the areas where there is water.</li>
<li>Paper (with high cotton content) is applied to top to transfer image using pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collodion</strong> (what Nadar used in the image)</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a glass plate</li>
<li>Coat gun cotton (aka collodion) on it à this is light sensitive and stays wet</li>
<li>Expose plate to light (exposure time of 3-5 minutes) (1% of original time of daguerreotypes)</li>
<li>Must develop plate while wet à anywhere you took the photo, you had to have a portable darkroom with you.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a<strong> satire</strong>. It mocks both the difficulties of the method and the uncertain status of photography. It mocks the <strong>literal and figurative elevation of art.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daumier</strong> believed it would take more than just going “up” to elevate photography to fine art. He did not believe photography was art. This was done in response to a French court decision in 1862 that determined that photos could be considered works of art.</p>
<p>This incited a large amount of mockery regarding photography.</p>
<h5><strong>What Do We See?</strong></h5>
<p>Nadar is a mad-scientist or absent-minded professor. After the perfect shot, he is about to lose his top hat, and tumble out of his hot air balloon. He will do anything for art!</p>
<p>What kind of photo is he taking? A collodion photo. The difficulty with these photos is you must develop it instantly! That means, not only is he struggling to get the perfect photo up in this blustery hot air balloon, but he also has a portable darkroom with him.</p>
<p>Below, every building in Paris has “<em>photographie</em>” written on it. Not only is all of Paris apparently “photo-worthy” to photographers (something that those who didn’t like photography thought ridiculous), but it will literally become a popular subject for photographers.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Nadar</strong> was known for capturing the <strong>first aerial photographs from the basket of a hot air balloon in 1858.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daumier’s</strong> lithograph (and what Nadar had done in the hot air balloon) touched on a controversial subject. People felt the photo took pictures of them without their permission. Later, in 1870, the government bought Nadar’s balloon for surveillance purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Daumier’s </strong>print captured the anxieties over the accelerated growth, industrialization, and changes regarding privacy in Paris, France, and Europe.</p>
<p>There was a 19<sup>th</sup> century debate over whether photography could be considered “art”. Some people said photography was just “worse painting”. They said it didn’t capture any of the emotion of painting. It was thought that it didn’t require any skill and that you just pushed a button.  It was said to eliminate the artist altogether. Or that anyone could do it without training!  Others said it would never have a use for science.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>The Horse in Motion</em></strong> by<strong> Eadweard Muybridge </strong>is an<strong> Albumen print. </strong></p>
<h5><em> </em><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Dry glass plate method</strong>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1659" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dry-Plate-Glass-Method.jpg?resize=718%2C581&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="718" height="581" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dry-Plate-Glass-Method.jpg?resize=1024%2C829&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dry-Plate-Glass-Method.jpg?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dry-Plate-Glass-Method.jpg?resize=768%2C622&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dry-Plate-Glass-Method.jpg?w=1435&amp;ssl=1 1435w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is the same process as collodion method, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not have to develop while wet (uses dry collodion instead)</li>
<li>Reduced exposure time to 1/25<sup>th</sup> of a second (allows you to photograph moving objects)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>How did he do it?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Muybridge</strong> set up a row of cameras with tripwires. Each would trigger a picture for a split second as the horse ran by.</p>
<p>Now, how did Muybridge replicate the photos for publication in a magazine?</p>
<p><strong>Albumen print</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take a dry glass photo</li>
<li>Coat with silver nitrate (which is light sensitive)</li>
<li>Take paper</li>
<li>Coat with egg white (albumen) and salt</li>
<li>Place wet side of glass with wet side of dry glass plate</li>
<li>Expose to light</li>
<li>Light helps the image to soak onto the paper and transfer the image over</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Muybridge was commissioned</strong> by Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University, governor of California and horseman. The work was designed to settle the question of whether a horse ever takes all four legs completely off the ground during a gallop. The human eye is not capable of breaking down such a fast action.</p>
<p>Stanford had made a $25,000 bet ($605,000 today) that all the hooves did come off the ground.</p>
<p>He hired <strong>Muybridge</strong> to prove he was right. He paid <strong>Muybridge </strong>$42,000 THEN (today, that is $1,018,000.00 +)</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>12 photographs shot in rapid succession</li>
<li>Shows that, yes, a horse does bring all four hooves off the ground</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This marked <strong>a new purpose for photography</strong>. It really could <strong>answer scientific questions</strong>. Photographic <strong>technology</strong> could do something that humans couldn’t do.</p>
<p>Interestingly, people did not believe these pictures were real, accusing him of forging them.</p>
<p>Photography now was used for a scientific purpose.</p>
<p>People were still skeptical.  What skill or talent did it take? It could be manipulated. It wasn’t artful</p>
<p><strong>Muybridge’s stop motion technique was an early form of animation that helped pave the way for the motion picture industry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zoetrope</strong>: instructions came in magazines to cut out the strips, place them in a circle and tape together the ends, lock through holes on the top and then spin it.</p>
<p><strong>Zoopraxiscope</strong>: expensive version.</p>

<h4><strong>Realism: A Reaction Against Romanticism</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Realism </strong>developed in France around the mid-19<sup>th</sup>-century. This was <strong>a widespread rejection of Romanticism</strong> in favor of the accurate and “objective” description of the ordinary, observable world. It examined the unidealized events and people of the period.</p>
<p><strong>Realism</strong> moved away from forms of the past toward a confrontation with <strong>contemporary issues</strong>. It renounced sentimentality and nostalgia of the past to instead <strong>focus on reality.</strong> This revealed contradictions and hypocrisy in our world. It illustrated <strong>discontent with political and economic issues</strong>. It asked the question&#8211; how does great wealth exist with great poverty?</p>
<p>Realism did not paint heroes but <strong>paints ordinary people</strong>. The focus was on the experiences and sights of <strong>everyday life</strong>. Artists, such as <strong>Courbet, Millet and Daumier</strong> became the social conscience and documentarians of 19<sup>th</sup> century France. It was also promoted by critics such as Charles Baudelaire.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Destroyed in 1945; was in Dresden</p>
<p><strong><em>The Stone Breakers</em></strong> by French artist <strong>Gustave Courbet</strong> was an oil on canvas work that was destroyed in 1945.  It measured 5 feet 5 inches by 8 feet 5 inches.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Realism is an accurate and objective depiction</strong> of the world full of everyday scenes and gritty hardships of impoverished lives. The crisp precision of Neoclassicism was going out of style, but Realist paint is still not gestural like Impressionist paint would later be.</p>
<p>The word <strong>realism</strong> means it has been painted to look true to life. This involves a large canvas with large figures, befitting a history painting – but this is not a history painting subject!</p>
<p>Brushwork is rough – consciously rejected Neoclassical finish. Often people thought the work was not finished. The canvas often seemed dirty with muted colors of brown yellow and cream. Figures are isolated in the foreground with flat space and dark color.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work illustrates the artist’s concern for the plight of the poor.  This was advocacy (maybe even propaganda) for a class that has been ignored and not deemed worthy, either by society or in art. It is not meant to be heroic. This is an account of abuse and deprivation and exploitation. It challenged traditions of academic painting and asked, “Why are the wealthy the only appropriate subjects?”</p>
<p>There was no commissioner. The art world was moving away from a clear patron or desire. Now, the art market had developed. There was an ample market for works that artists decided to create.</p>
<p>This work was rejected at the 1855 Salon as “inappropriate”. The reaction to the work was disgust. Never had mundane activities and peasants been represented in art, unless ennobled and honorably working the land.</p>
<p><strong>Courbet’s comment on the painting:</strong></p>
<p><em>I stopped to consider two men breaking stones on the highway. It’s rare to meet the most complete expression of poverty, so an idea of a picture came to me on the spot. I made an appointment with them at my studio for the next day. On one side is an old man of seventy, bent over his work, his sledgehammer raised, his skin parched by the sun, his head shaded by a straw hat; his trousers, of course material, are completely patched; and in his cracked sabots you can see his bare heels sticking out of socks that were once blue. On the other side is a young man with swarthy skin, his head covered with dusk; his disgusting shirt all in tatters reveals his arms and parts of his back; a leather suspender holds up what is left of his trousers, and his mud-caked leather boots show gaping holes on every side. The old man is kneeling, the young man standing behind him energetically carrying a basket of broken rocks. Alas, in labor such as this, one’s life begins and ends this way.</em></p>
<p>We see two figures work on the side of the road. They are stone breakers who are in charge of breaking up stones and clearing rubble so the roads can be made. This work was the results of industrialization</p>
<p>They are dirty, dressed in ripped and tattered clothing. We do not see faces and though they work together, they do not communicate. Not only are they isolated from us, but they are also isolated from each other. The figures are that of a boy (too young for this kind of labor) and an older man (too old for this kind of labor).</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>Set in front of a low hill, it looks like the town of Ornans, where Courbet lived. The hill reaches the entire top of the canvas except for a small spot on the far-right corner. This effectively isolates the laborers and makes us feel they are trapped. Their entrapment is not only physical (in this painting) but also social and financial.</p>
<p>Even though we know that the space between them and the hill is very deep, the colors and lack of sky make the painting seem flat and almost claustrophobic</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This work was destroyed in the WWII British Bombing of Dresden, in 1945. It was in a transport vehicle, with about 150 other paintings to a castle for safekeeping when it was bombed. Painted only one year after Karl Marx wrote <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> which impacted Courbet.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution across Europe led to a two-class system, the Bourgeoisie who were factory owners and the upper class, and proletariat or working class.</p>
<p>The message is that the Proletariat was exploited. They must unite and overcome the bourgeoisie to create the perfect classless society. Marx advocated for a violent revolution if necessary.</p>
<p>Courbet turned away from his wealthy bourgeoisie upbringing to adopt a self-imposed vagrancy and Bohemian lifestyle. This was unconventional with few ties. It was based on art, music, poetry, and free love.  Think of Bohemians as the hippies of 19<sup>th</sup> century Paris.</p>
<p>Courbet did not attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was not a formal member. This marks the end of the Ecole’s influence over artists.</p>
<h5><strong>Making Comparisons</strong></h5>
<p>While most traditional illustrations depicted peasants as quaint, pastoral, and happily at work, Courbet’s work showed the exploitation of laborers and the realities of their livelihoods.</p>

<h5><strong>About Courbet</strong></h5>
<p>French born artist <strong>Gustave Courbet (1819-1879) </strong>was instrumental in the emergence of Realism. Rejecting the French Academy and classical styles, his work focused on what was real. Think the working class and people living in the countryside. He was an outspoken political activist, <strong>Courbet </strong>died in Switzerland, while in exile.</p>
<h4><strong>Impressionists (1863-1886)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Impressionists </strong>departed from tradition. They <strong>rejected Renaissance</strong> perspective, balanced compositions, idealized figures, and chiaroscuro.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>they focused on</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate visual sensations through color and light</li>
<li>Bright palette of color</li>
<li>Inclusion of light</li>
<li>Short choppy brush strokes</li>
<li>lack of finish</li>
<li>Individual stylistic techniques</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Subjects</strong></h5>
<p>Contemporary Parisian life, including leisure, upper middle class, and the outdoors, were the main subjects for the Impressionists.</p>

<p><em> </em><strong><em>Olympia</em></strong> <em>by artist</em><strong><em> Édouard Manet </em></strong><em>is an</em><strong><em> oil on canvas work. </em></strong>It measures<strong><em> 4 feet 5 by 6 feet by 4inches. </em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form: REALISM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bold, flat brushstrokes with very little modeling</strong> comprise this work, ignoring the detailed modeling of the Renaissance and Baroque era. The paint seemed to just sit on the canvas. Many called this unskilled and childish. In fact, many parts seemed unfinished: curtain, bed sheets, breasts.</p>
<p>The Image seems stiff and flattened into two planes: foreground and background. <strong>Manet</strong> ignored shadows, modeling, and any atmosphere that would have softened her and given her a fleshy feel.</p>
<h5><strong>Function: IMPRESSIONISM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Avant-garde</strong> was new, unusual, and experimental. It was known for simplification of brushstrokes and the removal of transitional tones.</p>
<p>This work was displayed at the 1865 Salon (for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the national school of art after the Revolution disbanded the Academie Royale des peintures et sculptures).</p>
<p>Viewers weren’t sure of <strong>Manet’s </strong>motives.</p>
<p>Was he trying to produce a serious work of art?</p>
<p>Was he trying to continue the great art historical tradition of female nudes?</p>
<p>Was he honoring Titian? If you wanted to become a great painter, you had to contend with the Old Masters</p>
<p>Was Olympia a parody of Titian’s Venus of Urbino?</p>
<p>Reaction was very negative. The public was so outraged by the painting that the gallery was forced to hire two policemen to protect the canvas. Objections had more to do with the realism of the subject than the fact that she was nude. She was not a Venus, not a wife, not even an odalisque (even La Grande Odalisque was acceptable because she was exotic and foreign!) This was a woman you could run into in the city of Paris!</p>
<p><strong>Manet</strong> was trying to capture modern life. Here he paints a woman of his time – not a feminine ideal, not a goddess, but a real prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>Art for Art’s Sake </strong>the phrase that wasn’t coined until 1875, after this painting was made is indeed still relevant.  JM Whistler, an American painter, in a court trial is credited with coming up with the phrase. He expressed the inherent value in art, even if it lacks a moral, historical, or didactic message.</p>
<h5><strong>Content: IMPRESSIONISM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>How is this Impressionism?</strong> This is a scene of modern life, not necessarily the downtrodden who are exploited and toiling on the side of the road. Granted, many of us today would say prostitutes are exploited – however, from what we see of Olympia, she is a stable, well-off woman. We must remember the context of the period.</p>
<p><em>Olympia </em>depicts a reclining nude woman, with a maid and black cat, gazing at the viewer.</p>
<h5><strong>Olympia</strong></h5>
<p>Olympia is a prostitute (a common prostitute name in Paris). The work is <strong>based on Victorine Meurent, a longtime model and lover of Manet</strong>. This is the same model in <em>Luncheon on the Grass.</em></p>

<p>Olympia looks uninviting. Her body is stiff. Her torso is taut. If she is a prostitute, why is she so uninviting?</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Olympia</em></strong> was displayed in the Beaux-Arts Salon of 1865.  The jury accepted his work, but it still ignited scandal. It was called “inconceivable vulgarity” despite the Impressionists loving it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1667" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/115-Teacher.jpg?resize=603%2C452&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="603" height="452" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/115-Teacher.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/115-Teacher.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Manet</strong> is the bridge between Realism and Impressionism. This was a new beginning of artists becoming interested in modern Parisian life. There was something uniquely urban, sensational, and chic about modern Parisian life that deserved to be captured.</p>
<p>Impressionists departed from tradition by rejecting perspective, balanced compositions, chiaroscuro, and modeling. They desired sensation from color and light. There was a lack of finish to their work as well as individual technique.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Manet</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Édouard Manet (DATES)</strong> was a member of Paris’s upper-middle class (bourgeoisie). The artist was the only one of his contemporaries who didn’t have to sell his paintings to earn a living. Although his father wanted him to study law, Manet still preferred art. Manet loved Courbet, Velazquez, and Goya.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Saint-Lazare Station</em></strong> by French artist Claude Monet is an oil on canvas work measuring <strong>2 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 4 inches.  </strong></p>
<p>This was painted <strong>Plein air</strong> or plain air, meaning it was painted outside. This changed tradition. The artists who used this method to paint thought they should paint what they see and not bring items back to the studio. They brought soft aluminium tubes of paint with them. These were painted on small canvas, without the pretense of trying to be like history paintings. All materials were easily transported.</p>
<p><strong>Monet</strong> focused on capturing the essence of what he saw, rather than capturing formal clarity. The focus is on light, color, and atmosphere. Some areas are almost completely abstract, with loose, gestural, painterly brushstrokes. There is no sense of traditional modelling. This focuses on the play of light and color.</p>
<p>The hardness of lines is dissolved by the light. He used rapid, swift brushstrokes to create transience of smoke and conveys speed. Light is filtered through the smoke and metal grid.</p>
<p><strong>Is this compositionally different from a traditional landscape?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visual movement going back in space</li>
<li>Framing devices on either side</li>
<li>Lines that recede and carry our eyes back</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Modern critics had urged painters to “<strong>paint their own times</strong>”.  A wide variety of subject matter suddenly became acceptable (and even encouraged) when previously this subject matter would have been inappropriate and unthinkable for painting.</p>
<p>Charles Baudelaire had encouraged artists to be “painters of modern life”. A painter’s goal was to capture the very nature of modernity, distilling something essential from its transitory, busy qualities. The traditional Academy challenged this. Why paint what was viewed as ugly and unattractive? It was a radical idea to paint real life, but it was an emblem of modernity.</p>
<p>A train is a <strong>symbol of modern life</strong>, which was perfect for Impressionist goals.</p>
<p>Novelist Emile Zola said: “You can hear the trains rumbling in, see the smoke billow up under the huge roofs . . . That is where painting is today . . . Our artists have to find the poetry in the train stations, the way their fathers found poetry in forests and rivers.”</p>
<p>A series of 12 works were difficult to sell, however, as many buyers were not caught up with Impressionist ideas. Impressionists were not very popular in their lifetimes. This bothered many of them, especially Renoir. The term <strong>“Impressionist”</strong> was coined to be derogatory. It was used as a way of saying the artists couldn’t paint. They could only make impressions.</p>

<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>Monet rented a flat near the <strong>Saint Lazare Station</strong> in 1877 and asked to paint the station. In the spring of that year, he exhibited seven of these canvasses.  Having previously lived in Argenteuil, a Parisian suburb, Monet knew the phenomenon of commuter railroads. It was a very modern idea, that people would travel to work in the city. He viewed the changes in Paris very positively at this time.</p>
<p>By 1877, Paris had been transformed through industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancements (Haussmannization of Paris).</p>
<p>Under the direction of Baron Haussmann, prefect for Napoleon III, Haussmann was asked to achieve many things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernize boulevards to both widen and lengthen them.</li>
<li>Build new facades on existing apartments and build new buildings (fenestration – arrangement of doors, windows on an elevation; use uniform rooflines)</li>
<li>Build bridges to allow commuters to pass more easily over Paris’s Seine and surrounding rivers</li>
<li>Build new train stations to facilitate travel in and out of city, while increasing the size of existing ones. Saint Lazare is tripled in size.</li>
</ul>
<p>This led to an <strong>increase of commuters and encouraged tourism</strong> around the city. An expanding middle class could support this leisure time and they had the money. Trains became faster, and more times were offered for travelers.</p>
<p><strong>St. Lazare</strong> is still a working train station today. Visible in the current station is the eaved roof with glass panels at the top, like the one in Monet’s painting.</p>

<h5><strong>About Monet</strong></h5>
<p>French Impressionist <strong>Claude Monet (1840-1926)</strong> might be best remembered for soft pastel shades, of his serenely beautiful garden and lily pond, at his countryside home in Giverny, France. Other series of works include haystacks (1891), poplars (1892) and Rouen Cathedral (1894).</p>

<p><strong><em>The Coiffure</em></strong> by American artist <strong>Mary Cassatt</strong> is a <strong>17 by 12-inch work</strong> using both drypoint and aquatint.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Drypoint?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Drypoint is an etching technique. </strong>A metal plate is covered with wax. An image is carved or <strong>incised </strong>into the surface of the wax using a <strong>burin. </strong>Incise lines directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus while pressing down hard. This results in uneven, jagged lines where shavings curl up on either side and makes ridges. Rather than blowing or wiping those shavings off, they are left to give extra texture to the printing. This reveals the plate underneath. The printing part is cut into, while the non-printing parts are left uncut.</p>
<p>The plate is put into acid. The acid eats away at the exposed metal parts, leaving holes. The plate is heated so all the wax melts off. The surface of sheet is covered with ink, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. It will be wiped away from the rest of the plate. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Aquatint?</strong></h5>
<p>A layer (or more) of <strong>powdery resin</strong> is applied to the plate. The plate is heated so it melts. Then it is cooled to create a hardened, fine, but still grainy pattern.  The plate is placed in acid which eats away around the powdered resin, leaving small indentations in the plate.</p>
<p>The plate is rinsed, and then ink is applied, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.</p>
<p>Different <strong>tints and hues of a color can be controlled</strong> by how much resin is on the plate and how long the plate was in acid.</p>
<h5><strong>Influence from Japanese Prints</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Spare composition</li>
<li>Tilted perspective; love of flat patterning; rejects Western assumption of 3D space</li>
<li>Simplicity of line and form</li>
<li>See figures from multiple angles</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Repetition and Contrast of Form</strong></h5>
<p>Note <strong>the curve</strong> of the woman’s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair.</p>
<h5><strong>Limited Color Palette</strong></h5>
<p>The palette consists of only four colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>rose</li>
<li>white</li>
<li>brown</li>
<li>cream</li>
</ul>
<p>This enables us to focus on line and clarity. From an artistic point of view, <strong>Cassatt</strong> was trying to imitate the haziness and softness of Impressionist form.</p>
<h5><strong>Additional Notes</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Asymmetrical composition</li>
<li>Spatial flattening</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This is <strong>Mary Cassatt’s</strong> exercise in <strong>Japanese techniques. </strong>It is based on <strong>ukiyo-e prints.</strong></p>
<p>There is a de-eroticization of women, showing a boudoir/toilette scene that is not sexualized. This is likely because of the gender of the artist. This is a twist on the traditional female nude that we have been seeing in art history.</p>
<p>It captures fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are <strong>two cultural influences</strong>. While the work is Japanese in form (mostly), it is (mostly) Impressionist in content.  This was inspired by a woodblock print (in Cassatt’s personal collection) of the daughter of a prosperous Japanese Edo businessman. Toilette/boudoir scenes have their art historical roots in Old Master paintings. Think Odalisque, reclining Venuses, toilette scenes, and women bathing for example.</p>
<p>This is a private moment of a woman adjusting her hair. <strong><em>The Coiffure </em></strong>means “Hairdo” in French.</p>
<p>The <strong>ritual of getting dressed</strong> for the day had a great deal to do with status, based on royal rituals with Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette. To wear elaborate hairstyles, one needed a maid. Yet, the woman here is tending to her hair alone. We see a working woman. This can be a comparison between the historically elite nature of the event vs. the everyday normalcy of this woman.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>voyeuristic element</strong>, but the body is not sexualized. Though her breasts are exposed, her chest and the details of her body are otherwise muted. No anatomical accuracy or detail is given.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The was a wave of <strong>Japonisme</strong> spreading across Europe. In 1854, US Naval commodore Matthew Perry forcibly opened Japan to Western trade. Japanese goods flooded into Europe for the first time since the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Lacquers, fans, bronzes, hanging scrolls, kimonos, ceramics, illustrated books, and ukiyo-e prints were all popular. This inspired a Japanese style across Western art.</p>
<p>In 1890, Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris showcased an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints. <strong>Mary Cassatt</strong> was in the audience and was absolutely taken with these prints.</p>
<p>Here are two of the prints she saw&#8230;</p>

<h5><strong>About Mary Cassatt</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mary Cassatt (1844-1925)</strong> was born to a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She studied art in Europe and settled in Paris after befriending Degas. She regularly showed artwork with the Impressionists.</p>
<p>Cassatt rarely made nudes. Most often, she depicted her friends and family members with their children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Post-Impressionism</strong></h4>
<p>The main artists of this time were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seurat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cezanne</strong></li>
<li><strong>Van Gogh</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gauguin</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lautrec</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, they did nor recognize themselves as a group and had <strong>diverse stylistic paths. </strong>They expressed emotions, rather than just optical expressions.</p>
<p>Simplified colors and definitive forms as well as sensations through color and light was achieved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mont Sainte-Victoire </em></strong>by French artist<strong> Paul Cézanne </strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong>  2 feet 4 inches by 3 feet.</strong></p>
<p>There is a <strong>proto-cubist</strong> stress on geometric structure. You will see a co-existence of <strong>multiple viewpoints in a single scene. </strong></p>
<p>Are the views here always possible?</p>
<p>How can we see so many parts of the mountain flattened towards us?</p>
<p>How can we see the tops and sides of trees at the same time?</p>
<p>There are <strong>three horizontal bands in the composition</strong>. The band closest to us has foliage and houses. Rough patches of <strong>yellow, emerald, and green</strong> suggest a wide plain. <strong>Blues, violets, and grays</strong> form the mountain surrounded by sky. This alludes to atmospheric perspective through the bluish gray of the background. With its <strong>sketchy outlines </strong>this was not considered “finished” by academic standards of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cézanne </strong>used <strong>blocks of color</strong> to create forms and <strong>evenly distributed lighting. </strong>Our viewpoint is elevated, though we do not see how. Presumably, we are on another mountain. This in conjunction with the high horizon line allows us to see more of the valley.</p>
<p>A complicated pattern of diagonals can be found in each of the roofs, lines of the mountain, and arrangement of patches on the plain. This creates a deep, unified space that our eye can travel in.</p>
<p><strong>Flatness coexists with depth. </strong>Somehow, he has flattened everything by making forms using rectangular swabs of paint. Yet, we understand the illusion. Things recede backwards.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is yet <strong>another study on this mountain and valley</strong>. It occupied an important part of <strong>Cézanne&#8217;s</strong> oeuvre.  <strong><em>Mont Sainte-Victoire </em></strong>poses a central question.  Can you use flat, unmodeled color to create the illusion of depth?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1682" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/125-Flatness.png?resize=760%2C328&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="760" height="328" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/125-Flatness.png?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/125-Flatness.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Can you explore coexisting views while flattening? In other words, when we flatten something, inherently we understand that to mean that we can only see one side. However, <strong>Cézanne</strong> thinks. “Can I flatten things and still create the illusion of showing more than one flat side of this object?”</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are three segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foliage/houses</li>
<li>An expansive plain</li>
<li>Craggy mountain and sky</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <strong>sense of stillness</strong> across the landscape. Note the absence of human activity. We see human presence though. The subject was not chosen for historical interest or picturesque qualities. <strong>Cézanne’s</strong> principal interest was to explore the formal properties of his surroundings. For example, the huge iron cross that was on Mont Sainte-Victoire, never showed up in any paintings that he did of this scene.</p>
<h5><strong>The Location</strong></h5>
<p>Mont Sainte-Victoire dominates the skyline of <strong>Aix-en-Provence, the hometown of</strong> <strong>Cezanne</strong>. The mountain’s name means Mountain of Holy Victory. It is associated with a celebrated victory of Provence’s ancient Roman inhabitants against an invading army.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #000000; font-size: 1.375rem;">About the Artist</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Cézanne</strong> <strong>(1839-1906)</strong> was born in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. He developed artistic skills at an early age. Today, the artist is considered the father of modern art and a proto-cubist.</p>
<p><strong>Cézanne</strong> would return to this mountain more than 60 times in his career. Each time he painted it differently than the time before. He constantly tried multiple angles and points of views.</p>
<p><strong> Cézanne </strong>bought an acre of land on this hill in 1901 and built a studio on it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1683" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/125-Real-Image.jpg?resize=457%2C343&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="457" height="343" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/125-Real-Image.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/125-Real-Image.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Historically, within the artworld, <strong>Cézanne</strong> took Impressionism to its logical next step. What happens when you apply the loose, gestural brushstroke approach to everything, not just scenes of the Parisian bourgeois class? This is what <strong>Post-Impressionism</strong> does. It further pursues the Impressionist mission with simplified color, and broken lines and forms. It reacts against the naturalism of Impressionists</p>

<p><strong><em>Starry Night</em></strong> by Dutch painter <strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring 2 feet 5 inches by 3 feet. Loosened brushwork emphasizes the physical application of paint onto the canvas&#8212; painterly, gestural, impasto. The colors are vibrant.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It often seems to me that the night is even more richly colored than the day, colored with the most intense violets, blues, and greens. If you look carefully, you’ll see that some stars are lemony, others have a pink, green, or forget-me-not blue glow. And without laboring the point, it’s clear that to paint a starry sky, it’s not nearly enough to put white spots on black.” (September 1888)</em></p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>The Details of the Work</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Balance (tree on left balances with hills and stars on right)</li>
<li>Low horizon line, which allows us to see more of the sky</li>
<li>Deliberately stylized and simplified
<ul>
<li><strong>Van Gogh</strong> enjoyed medieval woodcuts: thick black outlines and simplified forms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Composite landscape: not based exactly on what he saw; he would not have had this view out of the window he worked from</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Landscapes were popular in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and <strong>Van Gogh</strong> participated in this trend. People desired landscapes in part because of their dissatisfaction with modern city life. He painted not what he saw, but what he felt. This was key in Post-Impressionism.</p>
<p>A night-time landscape presented technical challenges he wished to confront.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The artist painted this from his studio in the mental asylum of Saint Remy. His studio did not look out at the mountains, but rather had a view of the garden. It is assumed that he composed this view using elements of a few previously completed works in his studio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sky</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Largest “star” is Venus</li>
<li>Whirling forms in the sky match published astronomical observations of clouds of dust and gas (nebulae)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Town</strong></p>

<p>The steeple of the church resembles those in his native Holland, not the style common in France where he was when he painted this. We see presence of human life but not activity. See the hushed village of houses.</p>
<p><strong>Tree</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A cypress tree is a visual link between land and sky.</li>
<li>Symbolically, cypress could be seen as a bridge between life (earth) and death (sky).

<li>Commonly associated with heaven, graveyards, and mourning</li>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Van Gogh</strong> was a Dutch, largely self-taught, artist. He produced over 2,000 oil paintings, watercolors, drawings and sketches. He did not sell any works in his lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Chronology of breakdown beginning in 1888 (exact sequence is not known)</strong></p>
<p>The friendship/partnership with Paul Gauguin broke down. Although <strong>Van Gogh</strong> thought they were close friends, Gauguin denied feeling close to <strong>Van Gogh</strong> at all and doesn’t want a partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Van Gogh</strong> cut off his ear and delivered his ear to a prostitute. Later, he asked what had happened to him, as he had no recollection.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>Van Gogh</strong> was hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, in Saint-Remy, in southern France, a clinic for the mentally ill. During his convalescence here, <strong>Van Gogh</strong> was encouraged to paint by his brother Theo. The artist often chewed his paint brushes. Paint was made with led, which could cause difficulty focusing and halos in front of the eyes. This is caused by lead-induced enlargement of retina.</p>
<p>He was medicated with a plant called the foxglove. If given too much of the drug, it causes patients to experience yellow too intensely.</p>
<p>While staying in Saint Remy hospital in southern France, he was able to spend hours contemplating the stars without interference from gas or electric city streetlights. He had never seen the night sky like this.</p>
<p>In 1890, <strong>Van Gogh</strong> shot himself in the chest, while standing in a wheat field.  There were no witnesses and he died there two days later. Some have suggested he was murdered. He remains in our consciousness as the quintessential misunderstood genius.</p>
<h5><strong>Self Portraits</strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1514" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Van-Gogh.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<p>During <strong>Van Gogh&#8217;s</strong> time in Paris (1886-1888) he painted 20 self-portraits.</p>

<p><strong><em>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?  </em></strong>By French artist <strong>Paul Gauguin</strong> is an artwork of <strong>oil on canvas</strong> that measures <strong>10 feet and nine inches by 31 feet and 4 inches.</strong></p>
<p>This work casts realism aside in favor of expression. It <strong>uses color experimentally to evoke feelings</strong>. This is one of the greatest Post-Impressionist qualities. Here, colors are stylistic, vibrant, expressive, and nonrealistic. <strong>Golds and browns set against blues and greens.</strong></p>
<p>The work was inspired by the Impressionist interest in flat fields of unmodeled color from Japanese art.</p>
<p>Proportions are ignored. Space is not logical. The work uses the stylization that is common in Oceanic art. The simple <strong>bodies are not modeled</strong>.</p>
<p>Gaugin uses cultural appropriation or <strong>pastiche</strong>. In other words, he took the style of the Pacific and made it his own using <strong>primitivism.</strong></p>
<p>The composition is designed and painted to recall frescoes or icons painted on gold ground. The upper corners have been painted gold to contribute to this effect.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Potentially argues the inevitability of the basic processes of life: there is no escaping youth, adolescence, adulthood, and old age.</li>
<li>Precise, complete interpretations remain out of reach for historians; likely it had private meaning for Gauguin</li>
<li>Reveals <strong>primitivism</strong>: utilizes native traditions in non-native artwork</li>
<li>Represents the artist’s painted manifesto created while he was living on Tahiti</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe that this canvas not only surpasses all my preceding ones, but also that I shall never do anything better or even like it.”</em></p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Background Story</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gauguin</strong> was a “Sunday painter” or someone who paints for his or her own enjoyment. He had a wife and five children.  After his career as a stockbroker failed in the early 1880s, he took on painting more seriously. He went to work with Van Gogh for 9 weeks – we know how that turned out!</p>
<p>He had cardiovascular syphilis and when left untreated, will spread to the heart and veins. Syphilitic sores on legs were often mistaken for eczema and treated with…arsenic!</p>
<p><strong>Gauguin</strong> made his first visit to Tahiti in March 1891. He returned to Paris in 1893. He then abandoned his family and wanted to leave behind all that was “artificial”.  He complained that Tahiti was not as exotic as he expected. As a French colony, he said it had already been destroyed by missionaries and disease. Yet, he was swept up in the exoticism of what he did see.</p>
<h5>Marriage and Women</h5>
<p>When he was 50 years old, he married a 13-year-old Tahitian girl. She became pregnant almost immediately. At the same time, he married two other 14-year-olds! He gave all three girls syphilis. He named his Tahitian home the “House of Orgasm”. <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1694" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/123-Gaugin-Wife.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Gauguin</strong> has been criticized for sexualizing Tahitian women by painting them as frequently nude (or partially) and flirtatious, coy, and alluring.</p>

<p><strong>Gaugin </strong>painted this canvas in 1897. Just after learning of the death of his daughter Aline, he decided to climb up into the mountains, paint this canvas, and then kill himself afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p>While he may or may not have attempted suicide, he certainly realized that saying this would make a good story. “I painted this planning on committing suicide afterwards, and then decided not to because this painting made me want to live again.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Gauguin was extremely self-conscious of his image</strong> as a bohemian vanguard artist and concerned with self-promotion.</p>
<p>A few months after completing this, <strong>Gauguin</strong> sent it to Paris along with several other of his works, insisting they be exhibited altogether in a gallery. He sent his friends careful instructions about how they should be framed and who should be invited to the exhibition. These facts show that his awareness of the Parisian art market and how his art would be received was of utmost importance even as he supposedly renounced this society by living on a tropical island on the other side of the globe.</p>
<h5>Details of Life on Tahiti</h5>
<p><strong>Gauguin</strong> did capture details of Tahitian life, including their sculptures of deities. Such sculptures were not only common in Tahiti, but also across Oceania as seen with <i>Female deity </i>from Nukuoro.</p>

<h5>Making Comparisons</h5>
<p><strong>Making Comparisons</strong></p>
<p>Why is <strong>Mary Cassatt’s appropriation</strong> of Japanese ukiyo-e prints acceptable, whereas <strong>Gauguin’s</strong> appropriation of Tahitian artwork is not?</p>
<p>Cassatt is inspired <em>formally</em> – she takes Japanese techniques and adapts them to her own Impressionist content and individual style.</p>
<p><strong>Gauguin <em>adopts</em> not only the <em>formal</em> qualities of Oceanic/Tahitian design but tries too hard to “paint native.”</strong> This is complicated by <strong>Gauguin</strong> being French and part of the dominant culture that imperially oppressed the Tahitians. <strong>Gauguin</strong> saw their art as “simpler” and more “pure,” throwing racial and cultural assumptions into his appropriation of their style<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The Scream</em></strong> by Norwegian artist <strong>Edvard Munch</strong> was created using <strong>tempera and pastels on cardboard</strong>. It measures <strong>3 feet by 2 feet and 5 inches</strong>. This is a highly simple work.  There is an androgynous, skull-shaped head, elongated hands, wide eyes, flaring nostrils and an oval mouth.</p>

<h5><strong>More About the Form</strong></h5>
<p>The colors are <strong>orange, yellow, red, and blue-green</strong>. We would expect the sky to be blue and the land to be orange, but he has swapped this. The high horizon line lets us see more of the landscape than sky.</p>
<p>The strict linearity on the left contrasts with the curves and rounded shapes on the right. The foreground and background blend into one another. Wide curves of the figure are repeated in the landscape, and it literally ripples through or affects the man’s body.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is part of Munch’s semi-autobiographical cycle “The Frieze of Life”, painting not what he saw, but what he felt. It shows internal emotion through external form. This is Munch’s feelings/experience of <strong>synesthesia</strong> or the union of senses. It’s a visual depiction of sound and emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
<p>How does one convey experiences that are not visual?</p>
<p>How does one convey sensations that we experience with more than one sense?</p>
<p>Can art be used to depict sound, perception, anxiety?</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The theme of this work is <strong>death, dread, and anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p>Three main areas illustrate this.</p>
<p>The <strong>bridge</strong> extends at a steep angle from the middle distance at left to fill the foreground</p>
<p><strong>Human figures</strong> also display this. A <strong>screaming figure</strong> in the foreground, is linked to the landscape, as both are made of curves. One feels the cry of nature, a sound that is sensed rather than heard. The figure’s face resembles a Peruvian mummy that was exhibited at the World’s Fair in Paris in 1889. Many artists were inspired by this.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two rigid figures</strong> on the back of the bridge. Are they coming or going?</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape</strong> also represents the theme. The shoreline, lake, hills, and churning sky are reflected on the water.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Symbolism?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Symbolism</strong> expresses emotion and ideas. It ignores naturalism. Symbolist artists came from diverse international backgrounds.</p>
<p>“It is not the chair which should be painted, but the human’s relation to it”. In other words, it expresses emotion.</p>
<h5><strong>The Decline of the Traditional Art School</strong></h5>
<p>This was a <strong>Norwegian artist</strong>. The art world was expanding. One no longer had to be French, Italian, or Dutch. Therefore, traditional art schools were declining in their power and necessity in the art world.</p>
<h5><strong>Influences on the Work</strong></h5>
<p>Both his mother and sister died when <strong>Munch</strong> was a child. The artist was ill, depressed much of his life and suffered from synaesthesia.</p>
<p>Passage in his diary dated January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1892, written in Nice, France likely is the inspiration for this piece.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I was walking along the road with two friends. The sun went down, and I felt a gust of melancholy. Suddenly, the sky turned a bloody red. I stopped, leaned against the railing, tired to death, as the flaming skies hung like blood and sword over the city. My friends went on, but I stood there, trembling with anxiety, and I felt a vast and infinite scream tear through nature.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What could this have been? What was he inspired by?</p>
<p>The unnaturally harsh colors were likely observed by <strong>Munch</strong>. It may have been due to volcanic dust from the eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883. The dust lingered in the atmosphere for 10 years making extraordinary sunsets</p>
<h5><strong>Desired by All</strong></h5>
<p>In 2012, a version of <strong><em>The Scream</em></strong> sold to a private collector for $120,000,000, making it at that time, the 2<sup>nd</sup> highest price ever achieved at auction.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> copy in Metropolitan Museum of Art</p>
<p><strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Auguste Rodin </strong>is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round </strong>comprised of<strong> bronze. </strong>It was made using the<strong> lost-wax technique</strong>.</p>
<p>Figures are arranged into a dynamic circle. No one figure is the focal point. This allows the sculpture to be viewed in-the-round from multiple perspectives, without a clear leader. There is no contrast or emphasis.</p>
<p>The men are fragile vs. the heavy, rhythmic drapery that anchors them. This makes them broader. There is a roughness and stylization to the figures. Their bodies appear in agony, both twisted and contorted. This is not a heroic monument, unlike <em>George Washington</em> and <em>Augustus Prima Porta.</em></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>In 1885, <strong>Rodin </strong>was commissioned by the French city of Calais to create a sculpture that commemorated the heroism of Eustache Saint-Pierre.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saint-Pierre was a prominent citizen of Calais during the 100 Years War between England and France (began in 1337)</li>
<li>The statue would be timely as Calais being besieged by the English in the 100 Years War was similar to France being besieged by Prussia (Germany) in the Franco-Prussian War, which ended in 1871.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The patrons wanted: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A heroic statue of Eustache (It was Common to depict heroic men as sole figures like George Washington.)</li>
<li>Raised pedestal</li>
<li>Heroism was key to show Eustache in a heroic light</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Rodin wanted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All six men</li>
<li>An emotional work to enhance a personal connection with the viewer and bring the audience in.</li>
<li>He wanted it to be street-level so the audience could feel a part of the tragedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Resolution </strong></p>
<p><strong>This tug-of-war persisted between Rodin and the committee for ten years</strong>. The correspondence reveals that the Calais mayor tried to keep Rodin’s interest in the project despite their disagreements and delays.</p>
<p>The <strong>patrons were so disappointed</strong>, they did not want to purchase it. They wanted one statue of Eustache since he was the council leader of the burghers. And where was the pedestal?</p>
<p>They did not like that the men were unidealized and emotional. They thought this display of male emotion was inappropriate, and made them look vulnerable and weak, instead of ennobled.</p>
<p><strong>Rodin gave them a version with a pedestal</strong> to satisfy them. Then, <strong>he made a second version without a pedestal for himself.</strong></p>
<p>The patrons were still so disappointed, they did not order additional castings like they had discussed.</p>
<h5><strong>One Moment in Time</strong></h5>
<p>Look at the choice in <strong>the moment of the narrative</strong> (have not discussed this since Baroque art!).</p>
<p><strong>Rodin</strong> does not show these men when they were released. Instead, he shows them in the moment they gather to go to their deaths. We see them in agony. Instead of elating the men in the moment of full knowledge that they will not die, he shows us that the threat of death is very real.</p>
<h5><strong>The Men</strong></h5>
<p>Six men appear – these are the <strong>burghers</strong> (councilmen) of Calais. They are wearing only simple tattered sackcloth (<strong>King Edward humiliated them by making them wear sackcloth</strong> to reinforce his power over them). The clothing anchors them to the ground. There is no escaping their fate.</p>
<p>They appear <strong>thin and malnourished</strong>. The city had been besieged for 11 months. The man with the beard is <strong>Eustache de Saint-Pierre.</strong></p>
<p>The men stand together, but they do not make eye contact or interact with one another. Each is reflecting on their own choice and their own sense of loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some have their heads bowed.</li>
<li>Some raise their hands.</li>
<li>Others gaze out into the distance (one with key to the city: Jean d’Aire).</li>
<li>Some plea.</li>
<li>They are united then not through contact but by their posture and circumstance.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Warring and Death</strong></h5>
<p>Calais was besieged for 11 months with dwindling food and water. To end the assault on the French, English King Edward III made a deal with the city of Calais. If they wished to save their lives and the city, they must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surrender the key to the city to the king.</li>
<li>Six burghers must die!</li>
</ul>
<p>The burghers had to decide what to do. Unbeknownst to the burghers, their lives would be spared. The king’s wife Philippa persuaded him to not kill the burghers. She believed the deaths would be a bad omen for their unborn child</p>
<h5><strong>More About Rodin and</strong> <strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rodin</strong> was denied entry into the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris three times. He <strong>needed recognition and approval,</strong> so he took this job despite not being interested in it. The committee selected him because he was cheaper than a Beaux-Arts artist!</p>
<p>He revolutionized the sculpture and disregarded the traditions of heroic sculpture. <strong>Rodin</strong> used a version recounting the 100 Years War by a 14<sup>th</sup> century French chronicler named Jean Froissart.</p>
<h5><strong>Artist Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Auguste Rodin (1840-1917)</strong> was born in Paris, France. He started out in the field of decorative arts and did not become a sculptor until his 40s.  His most famous works include, <strong><em>T</em></strong><em>he Age of Bronze</em>, <em>The Thinker, The Kiss</em> and <em>The Burghers of Calais</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building</em></strong> by architect<strong> Louis Sullivan</strong> was constructed from <strong>steel, glass, and terra cotta. </strong>The building stands in <strong>Chicago, Illinois, US. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sullivan</strong> wrote his treatise on skyscraper architecture <strong>The Tall Office Building Considered Artistically</strong> in 1896. He was a pioneer of American commercial architecture.</p>
<p>Examples of <strong>Chicago Style</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>clean and streamlined</li>
<li>grid-like</li>
<li>simple with little to no ornamentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This type of architecture got its start in Chicago</strong>, hence the name.</p>
<p><strong>Sullivan</strong> coined the term <strong>form follows function</strong>. If form followed tradition or precedent, it would look classical.  With this architect’s method a building would reflect or telegraph its purpose. This is why we think buildings “look like prisons” or “look like banks” today.</p>

This made it more attractive to potential customers. A pedestrian’s eye will be immediately attracted to the bronze-colored ground floor.</p>
<p>The ornamentation is <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> a style that embraced natural decorative elements, twisting, ornate, curling vines, floral elements.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The late 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century in America saw the increase of wealth for the middle class. It became a consumer culture. Department stores and banking/offices needed to be built.</p>
<p>There was now a professionalization of jobs and an increase in white-collar jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Napoleon</strong> was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the later stage of the French Revolution. He was a self-absorbed man, with a great ego, who was the Emperor of France from 1804 to 1815.</p>
<p>During his rule, Napoleon had multiple portraits made.  He used the classical past as sources of symbolic authority for his short-lived imperial state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>David&#8217;s</strong> prominence as an artist and his commitment to classicism attracted three pupils:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gros</strong></li>
<li><strong>Girodet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ingres</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All three were deeply influenced by David. This moved <strong>art beyond the confines of Neoclassicism.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>La Grande Odalisque</em></strong> painted by <strong>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres</strong>, is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>2 feet 9 inches by 5 feet 5 inches.</strong> It encompasses elements of both Neoclassical/ Romanticism.</p>
<h5><strong>Neoclassical Elements </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>La Grande Odalisque</em></strong>  shows a glossy, enamel-like crispness, with a <strong>licked finish</strong> and no visible brushwork. This is an influence from David. It is as if someone has sucked all the air out of the image and it is full of precision.</p>
<p>The woman is arranged <strong>parallel to the picture plane</strong>. She is well-lit and pushed forward. There is Interest in the line. We can follow the line made by the curve of her back.</p>
<p><strong>Idealization and stylization</strong> are part of the work. She was painted “ideal” and sexual in Ingres’ mind, but this has required an unnatural elongation and stylization of her back. He claimed while painting that “he couldn’t stop himself” with her back. In fact, one may argue there are extra vertebrae in her back.  He believed a woman’s back was the most sensual part of the body. Additionally, placed her left leg in an impossible position, all to achieve a languidness and sense of curvature.  This reminds us of Mannerist elongation. Mannerism was Ingres’ favorite style.</p>

<p><strong>Compositionally</strong>, she is very large and touches nearly all four edges. This is a voluptuous and sensuous expression of the body. It was idealized to be erotic.</p>

<h5><strong>Color Evoking Emotion</strong></h5>
<p>She is icy, aloof, and has a distant look in her eye.  Use of blues makes the image cool with an association with the Middle East (lapis lazuli). Only warm spots are on her back and fan.</p>
<h5><strong>A Romantic Function</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>This work was commissioned by Caroline Murat, Napoleon’s sister, and Queen of Naples. She was interested in the Middle East, due to Naples’ trade connections with that area. The painting was an experiment with new Romantic ideas using exoticism and eroticism.</p>
<p>It <strong>examines a reclining female nude in a new context</strong> that is no longer mythological, but real and exotic. The work also celebrates French imperialism, while objectifying the fetishize of the Orient. The French had a sexual and cultural fascination with this region.</p>
<h5><strong>The Scandal</strong></h5>
<p>This work was shown in the Salon of 1819, and it caused a scandal. Viewers were surprised by the frank gaze and sensuality of the nude. This exotic context was new and shocking. There was no way to connect this woman to Venus. Also, the elongation of the body struck viewers as odd.</p>
<h5><strong>Content: Romantic</strong></h5>
<p>Romantic content has <strong>P.I.N.E </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong> is for <strong>Past </strong></li>
<li><strong>I </strong>is for <strong>Irrationality/Insanity</strong></li>
<li><strong>N</strong> is for <strong>Nature</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> is for <strong>Erotic/Exotic</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Life in a Harem </strong></h5>
<p>This work depicts an odalisque. This is a woman in a harem, as a concubine, companion, and source of entertainment. Ingres had never been in a harem. This was a western/French fantasy of what a harem would be.</p>
<p>Historically, this is completely inaccurate. The woman in the portrait is a white-washed version of an Oriental woman.</p>
<h5><strong>The Reclining Female Nude</strong></h5>
<p>This work plays into the tradition of the reclining female nude&#8212;going back to Titian. The previous nudes were all said to be Venus, or they could at least be interpreted as Venus.</p>
<p>With Ingres’ <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,</em></strong> there is no way to interpret her as a Venus – she is a harem girl. This is <strong>not in a classical setting</strong>. This is exotic and <strong>Oriental</strong> which at time was commonly used to refer to <strong>Near East and North Africa</strong>, not the Far East. Look at the peacock fan, turban, enormous pearls and hookah, a pipe for opium.</p>
<p>Her body is shocking to the viewer. This is not Venus but a girl whose occupation is sex. She isn’t an ideal, imaginary goddess, but she is a real woman! She gazes directly at us. Her body is bizarrely elongated, seemingly rejecting all classical idealization.</p>
<p>Her body is made acceptable to French culture for two reasons. Ingres turns her over and away from the viewer. She is not as pornographic as she could have been. Also, she is geographically distant not a European woman. This is what makes her exotic instead of scandalous.</p>
<h5><strong>Orientalism</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Orientalism</strong> was an interest in the Orient (Middle East and Asia) because of colonialism. France was a huge colonial power. The interest in non-western cultures was growing. This fascination with other cultures was paired with the belief that the French were civilized and superior.</p>

<h5><strong>About Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1864) </strong> was a student of David. He absorbed his teacher’s Neoclassical vision but reinterpreted it. Ingres won the Prix de Rome and lived in Italy from 1806 – 24. In 1814, he traveled to Naples where he was employed by Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, and Napoleon’s sister. Naples, because of its proximity to the Middle East and its connections with trade, was interested in Orientalism and exoticism.</p>
<p>The artist returned to serve as the French Academy’s director, in Rome, from 1835 – 1841</p>
<p>When Ingres painted <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,</em></strong> he had started to reject neoclassical subject matter as too stuffy, dull, and arrogant in its moral instruction.</p>
<h4><strong>Romanticism: P.I.N.E</strong></h4>
<p><strong>P stands for past.</strong> There was a longing for medieval, pre-industrial Europe, especially about nature. Also think Gothic architecture, Shakespeare, and classical antiquity.</p>
<p><strong>I stands for irrational and insanity</strong>. This was a time for the human psyche and topics that transcended the use of reason. Examples include Gericault’s portraits of insane asylum patients.</p>
<p><strong>N stands for nature</strong>. There was a longing for the purity of nature, which defies rationality.</p>
<p><strong>E is for both emotion and the exotic</strong>. Emotion and passion. Reason. Exotic themes were popular and did not adhere to the European emphasis on rationality. This was the result of European colonialism and interest in harems.</p>

<p><strong><em>Y no hai remedio (And There’s Nothing to Be Done) </em></strong>by <strong>Francisco de Goya</strong> uses <strong>etching, drypoint, burin, and burnishing.</strong> The work measures <strong>5 feet by 6.5 feet</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Uses the etching technique</strong>:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A metal plate is covered with wax.</li>
<li>(<strong>Drypoint method happens here</strong>) An image is carved (incised) into the surface of the wax using a burin, revealing the plate underneath (the printing part is cut into, while the non-printing parts are left uncut).</li>
<li>The plate is put into acid and eats away at the exposed metal parts, leaving holes.</li>
<li>The plate is heated so all wax melts off.</li>
<li><strong>(Burnishing technique happens here)</strong> Surface of sheet is covered with ink, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas.</li>
<li>Ink will be wiped away from the rest of the plate</li>
<li>Paper is applied to top to transfer image using pressure</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Drypoint technique is used in the second step listed above.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Incise lines directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus while applying <em>lots</em> of pressure.</li>
<li>This results in uneven, jagged lines where shavings curl up on either side and makes ridges.</li>
<li>Rather than blowing or wiping those shavings off, they are left to give extra texture to the printing.</li>
<li>Because the ridges/shavings are delicate and will be flattened through printmaking, the earliest prints in a series are more expensive and highly valued.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Burnishing technique is used in the fifth step listed above</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>You can see this where the smoke comes out of the gun à the burnishing makes this spot look transparent, wispy, and smoky.</li>
<li>Plate is rubbed with a burnisher to polish it, giving it a shiny or slick look once the ink is applied.</li>
<li>The plate is polished to lighten it.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>A general in the Spanish army asked Goya to record the horrors imposed on the country by Napoleon’s troops. It needed to be Pro-Spanish and Anti-French.</p>
<h5><strong>Propaganda</strong></h5>
<p>It draws attention to the abuses and injustices of Napoleon’s rule in Spain by criminalizing and protesting the French occupation. Thus, Goya made his into prints for easy distribution. Yet, it was not printed until 35 years after Goya’s death. Before this, it was dangerous to publish these political views.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Remember <strong>PINE </strong>(Past, Irrationality/Insanity, Nature, Emotion/Exotic)</p>
<p>This is part of a series called <strong><em>The Disasters of War</em></strong> that focused on Napoleonic abuses against the Spanish.</p>
<p>Original title of the series was: <em>Fatal Consequences of Spain’s Bloody War with Bonaparte and other Emphatic Caprices</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1<sup>st</sup> group showed the consequences of violence between Spain and France</li>
<li>2<sup>nd</sup> group showed the effects of a famine under French rule</li>
<li>3<sup>rd</sup> group showed the disappointment of Spanish rebels</li>
<li>82 images total</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>man</strong>, <strong>blind-folded</strong>, head downcast, stands bound to a wooden pole. He wears all white, with rips and tears. He reminds us of Christ, broken but still heroic.</p>
<p>A <strong>man on the ground</strong> has been murdered. Blood and brain ooze out of his skull.</p>
<p>Other men are similarly secured to stakes in the background. We wonder if all these men are civilians. Or soldiers? It is intentionally ambiguous. Does it matter? Darkness crowds us.</p>
<p>The cause of the violence is Napoleon’s soldiers, all in a neat row on the sides. All we can see is the <strong>barrels of their guns</strong> pointed at the main figure. This cannot be stopped. His death is inevitable.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Napoleon seized control of Spain in 1807.  </strong>He did this under the guise of helping Spanish King Charles IV invade Portugal. Charles agreed. Napoleon moved all his troops into Spain. Then, he swiftly overthrew Charles IV.  Napoleon took the throne and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as ruler of Spain.</p>
<p>The result was the <strong>Peninsular Wars (1807-1814)</strong>. A bloody rebellion ensured with tremendous loss on Spanish side.</p>
<p>Goya had originally been the court artist to Charles IV. Then court artist for Joseph Bonaparte!</p>
<p>Goya could not publish this during his life, and his family waited for 35 years, until after his death to do so. They wanted to be sure that the Napoleonic influence was gone.</p>
<p>France was expelled in the Peninsular Wars.</p>
<p>This work was inspiration for Goya’s most famous image: <strong><em>Third of May.</em></strong></p>

<h5><strong>Making Comparisons</strong></h5>
<p>When armies are depicted as regimented, ordered, and repetitive, the viewer interprets the army as powerful, strong, and efficient.</p>
<p>Previously, we saw this in <em>Standard of Ur</em>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227" style="width: 613px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-227" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Standard-of-Ur-Peace.jpg?resize=613%2C413&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="613" height="413" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-227" class="wp-caption-text">Standard of Ur, Peace<br />© Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, <em>Y no hai remedio</em> criticizes a ruler’s brutal use of military might, whereas in <em>Standard of Ur</em>, we are meant to be in awe of this ruler who uses military might to create peace.</p>

<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Eugène Delacroix </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 8 feet 6 inches by 10 feet 8 inches.</strong></p>
<p>Delacroix believed color was more important than precise academic drawing (He would have agreed with Rubens on this point.) In <strong><em>Liberty Leading the People </em></strong>note the contrast and emphasis on Liberty, the clouds behind her are white and grey and do not distract us from her face. This is a pyramidal composition with Liberty at the apex.</p>
<p>The work was completed in <strong>history painting style</strong> with a large canvas size and monumental figures. What is unusual however is that the figures are not calm, academic models or even models that are ennobled. Instead, while we do see urgency and power, we also see low class, death, and grittiness.</p>
<h5><strong>Delacroix’s Purpose</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pro-republican/anti-monarchist statement</li>
<li>Showing France in an honorable light</li>
<li>Visual commemoration of July 1830 Revolution</li>
<li>Manifesto that celebrates Parisians and their revolutionary drive</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Initial Reaction </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People</em></strong> caused an immediate scandal. It seemed like it was trying to be a history painting, but this was <strong>not an appropriate subject</strong> because it was too modern. Even though one could argue the Marie de’ Medici series was a “modern history painting,” these had been painted in the Grand Manner, and these figures were gritty, unglamorous, and dead!</p>
<p>The realism of the dead and dirty bodies, combined with the figures’ distance from academic models provoked harsh criticism. Critics said Liberty looked like a prostitute and insurgents looked like criminals.</p>
<p>The French government bought this to remind Louis-Philippe of how he came to power. After the 1848 Revolution, when Louis-Philippe was overthrown, it was taken down for being too inflammatory and kept out of view. Paris was concerned about inciting yet another violent revolution.</p>
<p>The work was moved to the Louvre to exhibit in 1863.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People </em></strong>depicts the <strong>July Revolution of 1830</strong>. It uses the conventions of a history painting, but it was painted this the same year the event happened.</p>
<p><strong>Marianne </strong>is represented as an <strong>allegory</strong> or a human who represents a moral or political idea. Here, the idea is Liberty. Here, she wears the Phrygian cap, a classical signifier of freedom from ancient Rome for freed slaves.</p>
<p>Delacroix was inspired by Michelangelo’s nudes for the figure of Liberty. Marianne is monumental, and nude to the waist, in reference to classical nudes.  He painted her in yellow to allude to that classical nudity. Vibrant, rebellious, victorious, and fiery, she represents the will of the people. She holds a bayonetted musket in one hand and the tricolor flag in the other.</p>
<p>Men around her represent the different types of people who participate in the revolution. We see that all classes are united in this revolution</p>
<p><strong>Gavroche </strong>is a symbol of youthful revolt against injustice. He is based on the character of Gavroche in Victor Hugo’s Les Mis (Hugo and Delacroix were friends). Wearing a black velvet beret, worn by students, he has a cartridge pouch slung across his shoulder. There is a war cry on his lips, urging others to fight, while brandishing a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Bourgeoisie</strong> is the kneeling figure with a top hat that may be based on Delacroix himself. Notice the loose-fitting trousers and elegantly tailored jacket. This represents that the revolution is for the affluent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1611" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/108-B.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1611" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/108-B.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>A worker</strong> wears and apron, shirt, and sailor’s trousers. From his dirty body, we can see he is a laborer.</p>
<p><strong>The ground</strong> is littered with the dead. One figure lacks pants. This is intentional with the aim of showing savagery, while also demonstrating Delacroix’s knowledge of the male nude.</p>
<p>Chaos, fervor, and passion is captured.</p>
<p>Notre Dame situates the action in Paris (also another reference to Victor Hugo and his book the Hunchback of Notre Dame).</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: Romanticism shoes <strong>PINE</strong> (Past, Irrationality/Insanity, Nature, Emotion/Exotic) and is full of emotion.</p>

<p><strong>Eugène Delacroix </strong>(1798-1863) was an exceptionally trained French Romantic artist. He was admitted to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, which was not associated with the state Academy, but a rival.</p>
<p><strong>Delacroix</strong> lived in Paris during this event. He began his allegorical interpretation of this moment in September 1830. It was exhibited in May 1831.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>Slave Ship (Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On) </em></strong>by artist <strong>Joseph Mallord William Turner</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>3 feet by 4 feet</strong> in size.</p>
<p>The painting has an emotive power of color due to the wide range being used. Look at the enormous, deep red sunset (Turner sunset) over brown sea. The sun seems to slice open the sky. The colors are fiery and rageful. (Imagine what this would look like if David painted this – far more restrained.)</p>
<p>There is a thick sensuality of paint. This later had a huge effect on modern art.</p>
<p>Clarity and scale are not important here – Turner is willing to let them go.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>In 1840, at the first World Congress meeting of the anti-slavery league (Crown Prince Albert, a well-known abolitionist, was present at this meeting). Turner’s painting was exhibited. Turner was deeply moved by this story and might have wished to impress Crown Prince Albert at this World Congress meeting.</p>
<blockquote><p>The work was exhibited with lines from a poem that Turner himself had written:</p>
<p><em>Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay, </em></p>
<p><em>Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds</em></p>
<p><em>Declare the typhon’s coming. Before it sweeps your decks, throw</em></p>
<p><em>Overboard the dead and dying – ne’er heed their chains</em></p>
<p><em>Hope, hope, fallacious hope! Where is thy market now?</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Transcendentalism</strong> is the awe and amazement at the brutal and indiscriminate power of nature.</p>
<p>This work is also a <strong>criticism of society</strong> and questions the viewer. Is this worth the profits?</p>
<p>The viewer sees the magnitude of man’s cruelty vs. the magnitude of nature’s power. The moral of the story is that the power of nature is greater than the power of man. Remember, this is during the Industrial Revolution when the arrogance of man (industry, science, technology) is starting to worry people.</p>

<p><strong>Drama</strong> is more important than accuracy. The artist takes liberties by adding in a storm to heighten the drama of the story. Turner was inspired by the Zong, but not documenting it.</p>
<p>There is a sailing ship on the horizon going towards the left. There are body parts, chains, fish, and sea monsters sticking up out of the water. Hands and legs sticking out of the water are dark-skinned. We see chains evident (even though they would not float with these on).</p>
<p>Sea gulls are encircling. Sails of the ship are not unfurled as sea spray flies everywhere.  The storm is coming in.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>allegory of the fight of humankind with the elements</strong>. Is this a biblical metaphor? Christians often utilized a ship in a storm as a metaphor.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of The Zong </strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Zong was a British slave ship</strong> that sailed for Jamaica in <strong>1783</strong>. It was the captain’s last journey and he wanted to collect a great profit for retirement. He sailed with 470 slaves and 17 crew. Many had begun to die from sickness in the Doldrums of the Atlantic (an area where the winds are so calm, there are hardly any winds at all). Seven of the 17 crew died, along with 50 of the slaves.</p>
<p>The slaves got sicker and sicker, and water was running out. The only way to collect insurance on dead slaves and not take a loss is to claim accidental drowning (not sickness). This was intended to encourage captains to treat slaves humanely, by not letting them starve, or not having enough water.</p>
<p>The ship captain doubts the likelihood of them all making it&#8211;not just alive, but healthy enough that he could sell them for a profit. So, he decided to throw them overboard and collect insurance. This way he could collect 30 pounds per slave.</p>
<p>He threw 132 slaves overboard.  Most were women and children. Some did not sink and struggled, trying to climb back up on the boat. The crew then attached cannonballs to them and then threw them over.</p>
<p>This left 288 slaves on the boat. These were sold to slave traders in Jamaica for 36 pounds each.</p>
<p>Once in Jamaica, the ship’s owner filed for insurance. The captain said his actions of throwing slaves overboard was the humane thing to do and necessary because of his concerns over lack of water.</p>
<p>The insurance company refused, so the ship owner and captain went to court to make the insurance company pay. The court case was not about the morality of throwing these slaves overboard.</p>
<p>The court ruled in favor of the owner/captain making the insurers pay 30 pounds per slave.</p>
<p>Judge said: “<em>What is this claim that human people have been thrown overboard? This is a case of goods. Blacks are goods and property – it is madness to accuse these well-serving men of murder. They acted out of necessity and in the most appropriate manner. The late Captain Collingwood acted in the interest of his ship to protect the safety of his crew. The case is the same as if wood had been thrown overboard</em>.”</p>
<p>The case was brought to attention of abolitionists who decried the injustice.</p>

<p>Both <strong><em>Slave Ship</em></strong> and <strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em></strong> depict humans who are at the mercy at nature.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em>, in <strong><em>Slave Ship</em></strong>, the humans are in this predicament because of human cruelty.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Oxbow (View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm) </em></strong><em>by artist</em> <strong>Thomas Cole </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 4 feet 4 inches by 6 feet 3.  </strong></p>
<p>The artists during this time did not paint outdoors, but only sketched. <strong>Cole’s</strong> innovation was to lift landscape painting to the history painting level, with a large size and a grand and noble treatment. The diagonal line from top left to bottom right divides the image. We literally see an East and a West.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This was intended to be <strong>a marketable painting</strong>. There was no patron. It shows the potential and possibility of the national landscape. The landscape encapsulates the uniqueness of America. The expansion is divinely ordained (<strong>Manifest Destiny</strong>).</p>
<p>While the Western expansion positively altered the land, tension is created as wild landscape is eliminated. When does this become too much?</p>
<h5><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1619" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/109-Teacher.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>When examining <strong>PINE (Past, Irrationality/Insanity, Nature, Emotion/Exotic)</strong> we understand this work illustrates nature.  The work depicts the Connecticut River near Northampton, Massachusetts after a thunderstorm, with a recognizable bend in the river, that the locals call “The Oxbow”.</p>
<p><strong>Sublime</strong>, intense, dramatic, grand, and incomprehensible. This landscape is vast, and beyond our ability to grasp.</p>
<p>To the <strong>west/left</strong> <strong>side</strong> a huge storm is rolling away on a virginal landscape that is unruly and untamed. A blasted tree on the bottom left shows the indiscriminate power of nature.  So too does the lightening.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Cole</strong> includes his <strong>self-portrait</strong> in the lower part. He is an American making American art in the American wilderness. Artists can bridge the gap between these two worlds. Wearing a coat and hat, he stands before a stretched canvas placed on his easel.</p>
<p>To the <strong>east/right side </strong>is a peaceful, pastoral landscape. Man has made this landscape productive and civilized. What was once wild has been overtaken is becoming productive and orderly. Animals, crops, chimneys, and boats are illustrated, while the sun shines brightly.</p>
<p><strong>On the hill</strong>, logging scars are visible which form two Hebrew letters.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you read them right side up, they say “Noah”.</li>
<li>If you read them upside down, they say “Almighty”.</li>
<li>Does the beauty of the land reveal God? Is human intrusion sacrilege? Is civilization linked to God? Historians are not sure what Cole meant by these inclusions.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Landscape by the early 19<sup>th</sup> century</strong> had become synonymous with American pride.</p>
<ul>
<li>Westward expansion – westward goes the course of empire</li>
<li>Discussions of political expansion dominated western discourse</li>
<li>Louisiana Purchase had recently doubled the size of the US</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Landscapes were popular </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Captured American uniqueness/potential (<strong>Manifest Destiny</strong>)</li>
<li>Remedy for urban life/industrialization (<strong>Transcendentalism</strong> was a popular philosophy and ideology promoted the immersion into nature as healing, powerful and good.)</li>
<li>Capture life/state that is vanishing</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Course of the Empire Series</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Cole</strong> painted <strong>The Course of the Empire Series</strong> which shows five stages of landscapes that detailed the fall and rise of civilization.  Included here are additional works for you to enjoy!</p>

<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Thomas Cole (years) </strong>was a member of the <strong>Hudson River School</strong> (not an actual school but a group of New York city-based landscape painters).</p>
<p><strong>Cole</strong> was <strong>British</strong> and moved to Philadelphia when he was 17. Then, he moved to Steubenville, Ohio which was literally on the edge of the American West.</p>

Revival of tradition</p>
<p><strong>Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) </strong>by architects <strong>Charles Barry and Augustus W. N. Pugin</strong>, located in <strong>London, England</strong> is constructed from <strong>limestone masonry and glass</strong> in <strong>Perpendicular Gothic</strong> style. This emphasizes the verticality, as well as Gothic ornamentation with pinnacles decorating the top, large towers, and large windows that emphasis the vertical tracery.</p>
<p>The horizontal balance and rhythm of the façade is a classical component. The architects wanted to balance the horizontal with the vertical.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Original palace of Westminster here burned down; royal family used to reside here</li>
<li>Seat of House of Commons and House of Lords = Houses of Parliament</li>
<li>Show the prestigious and beautiful past (Gothic focus on craftsmanship; ignore industrial architecture)</li>
<li>Show pride and power and status of British government</li>

<p>This is the meeting place for members of both houses and where members of parliament can meet their constituents. It is a lofty stone octagon with an intricately tiled floor.</p>
<p>Arches/exits include the patron saint of each of the four constituent countries of the UK.</p>
<ul>
<li>England: St. George</li>
<li>Wales: St. David</li>
<li>Scotland: St. Andrew</li>
<li>Northern Ireland: St. Patrick</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <strong>windows</strong>, there are metal grilles, which were placed here after the fire of 1834. These were built to cover the windows in the <strong>Ladies’ Gallery in the House of Commons</strong> to ensure MPs were not distracted by the women while at work. This area was not accessible to all women (only well-connected, elite women) and was difficult to see and hear out of. This made the room hot and stuffy and when wearing corsets, some women fainted. These women became a powerful symbol of women’s exclusion from Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Suffragettes</strong> targeted the gallery during the campaign for the vote in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. In 1908, two suffragettes chained themselves to the grille as a protest. It had to be removed from the window for the women to be cut off. The grilles were removed permanently from the gallery following a house vote in 1917.</p>

<p>This was built in 1097-1099 under William II, son of William the Conqueror (from Bayeux Tapestry!). He wanted to impress his new subjects with his power and majesty. This was the largest hall in England (and Europe) at the time and measured 240 by 67 feet.</p>
<p>The <strong>hammerbeam roof</strong> a decorative open timber roof typical of English Gothic architecture. The roof is still mysterious to historians. This predates the point where builders could create roofs wider than the available timber. Because of this, it has been assumed that there must have been columns to support the ceiling but there is no evidence of any.</p>
<p>The room is used for banquets, ceremonies, coronations, law courts, funerals.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Pre-1834: English kings lived in <strong>Palace of Westminster.</strong></p>
<p>In 1834 the Great Fire destroyed much of <strong>Palace of Westminster</strong>, both houses of Parliament as well as most other buildings. Westminster Hall was saved through a change of the wind and heroic fire-fighting efforts. Wooden tally sticks (voting system) were burned in the basement when the fire started.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria had to vacate and build a new palace (Buckingham Palace).</p>
<p>A competition was held to see who would build the new Houses of Parliament. The stipulation was that the new structure had to be in one of two historical, or what were called Revivalist styles: Neo-Elizabethan (Shakespearean times) or Neo-Gothic. Industrialization unsettled people as modernity seemed ugly. When they looked to the past, it seemed beautiful and traditional. Both were styles associated with the pre-Industrial era and English ingenuity and craftsmanship, even though Gothic wasn’t English, it was adopted in England.</p>
<p>Neoclassicism was popular but was associated with revolution and republicanism. These were associations which Britain did not want to have, as it is one of a few European countries that did not have a revolution in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>There were 97 entries that included 91 in Gothic and 6 in Elizabethan.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Barry</strong>, famous English architect, won the competition. He estimated it would take 6 years to build but took more than 30 years and cost over 2 million pounds back then.</p>
<p>Barry turned to <strong>Augustus Welby Pugin</strong>, a 23-year-old architect who was an expert in Gothic style.</p>
<p>Barry designed the overall layout and Pugin added in the decoration on the interior and exterior.</p>

<h4><strong>Early Photography</strong></h4>
<p>In the nineteenth century, artists and scientists alike <strong>sought a mechanical way to capture an image. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Daguerre</strong> is (arguably) the first to come up with a photographic technique.</p>
<p>A debate ensured regarding photography’s artistic merit. If it is mechanical, does it involve artistic expertise or creation? If it does not, how can photography be art? On the other hand, if photography is mechanical and a “true” representation of what you see, can photography always be believed?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1642" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daguerreotype.jpg?resize=874%2C612&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="874" height="612" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daguerreotype.jpg?w=874&amp;ssl=1 874w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daguerreotype.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daguerreotype.jpg?resize=768%2C538&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early photography was subject to a great deal of criticism. People wondered what it was good for. It seemed as if it had no use in the sciences and it was a “lazy” way to make art that removed the artist’s hand.</p>
<p>Early photographers <strong>aimed to legitimize photography by likening photography to painting</strong>. In these early photographs, they are commonly still lifes with classical allusions.</p>

Science</p>
<p><strong><em>Still Life in Studio</em></strong> by artist<strong> Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre </strong>is a work of<strong> photography.</strong></p>
<h5>What is a <strong>Daguerreotype?</strong></h5>
<p>Each produced a single image (the “negative” is the plate/photo). These images are one of a kind, and there is no way to reproduce them.</p>
<h5><strong>The Process</strong></h5>
<p>The artist <strong>took a plate of silver-plated copper</strong> and exposed it to <strong>iodine</strong> to make it light sensitive. Then he <strong>exposed it to light in the camera</strong>.</p>
<p>Initially, this light exposure took about eight hours. Later technology improved and ranged depending on how much light was present. The stronger the light, the less the exposure needed. For example, in the middle of the day there was ample light.</p>
<p>At this point, <strong>mercury fumes</strong> would develop. This was stabilized with <strong>salt water</strong> (<strong>hypo</strong>)*. This step was added after they realized the plates continued to develop through being exposed to light. Many early images have simply turned black.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This work was experimentation only and not made for a patron. The artist wanted to make a permanent image using light and chemistry.</p>
<h5><strong>Art or Science </strong></h5>
<p>A medium of artistic expression?  A powerful scientific tool? What use could it possibly be for? It could be so easily manipulated and wasn’t powerful enough yet to capture great details or small objects.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Still lifes were common</strong>.  This was not point and click photography! With an exposure time of up to eight hours, anything other than still lifes was difficult to take photos of.  Even sitting completely still for ten to fifteen minutes without moving was challenging.</p>
<p>The earliest <strong>daguerreotypes</strong> were still lifes with plaster casts of antique sculpture. For practical reasons white casts reflected light well. Still lifes were immobile during long exposures.</p>
<p>For <strong>symbolic reasons </strong>white casts lent an aura of “art” and “classicism” to photos and helped to legitimize them.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The principle of a camera had been discussed since antiquity, but it wasn’t discovered until 19<sup>th</sup> century. Think of Vermeer’s <strong>camera obscura.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre’s</strong> (1787-1852) had been searching since the mid-1820s for a way to take a photo using light and chemistry. By 1829, he showed his new medium at both the Science Academy and Fine Arts Academy in Paris. Even from the start, it was unclear where photography would fit best.</p>
<p>This is one of only about 25 of Daguerre’s images to survive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>18th Century Art</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1251" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101-The-Swing.jpg?resize=800%2C1034&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="1034" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101-The-Swing.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101-The-Swing.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Theme: “Feminine vs. Masculine”</strong></h3>
<p>Interest in the small, delicate, and decorative was thought to be a feminine <strong>Rococo</strong> quality.  Ultimately, <strong>Neoclassicism</strong> emerged as a reaction to Rococo’s effeminate style. Neoclassicism is couched as a masculine celebration of the stoicism and restraint of classicism.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context (1700s)</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Louis XIV’s court grew tired of the opulence after his death and left for Paris townhouses.</li>
<li>Bourgeoisie grew and so did the interest in art</li>
<li>18<sup>th</sup> century Enlightenment</li>
<li>Rejection of royal authority</li>
<li>Discovery of ruins at Herculaneum and Pompeii</li>
<li>1750s: Beginnings of English Industrial Revolution</li>
</ul>
<h5><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1240" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Early-1700s-Europe-Map.gif?resize=603%2C541&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="603" height="541" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Multiple styles emerged</strong> during this time. The French Royal Academy (Académie) dominated painting, training, and exhibitions (Salons). There was the initial triumph of <strong>Rubenistes</strong> <strong>over Poussinistes</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1768 the British Academy was created. Artists trained by drawing from live models.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong> retained interest in <strong>classicism</strong>. Landscape architects were popular.</p>
<p><strong>Interior design</strong> featured furniture, clocks, and china.</p>
<h5><strong>The Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Enlightenment </strong>was a new philosophy and movement in Europe and the American colonies during the late 17<sup>th</sup> and early 18<sup>th</sup> century. (Age of Enlightenment, Age of Reason, emphasized rationalism)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominated by Neoclassicism drawing from ancient Greece and Rome</li>
<li>Neoclassicism started in 1760 and was opposite to the decadence of Baroque and Rococo styles</li>
<li>Neoclassism was especially dominant in architecture and sculpture for which artist had plenty to directly reference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rococo: </strong>18<sup>th</sup> century late art <strong>also known as Late Baroque</strong>. Rococo was once the most common art style. Later it was deemed frivolous and indulgent. Think artists <strong>Jean-Honoré Fragonard</strong> and <strong>François Boucher.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neoclassicism:  </strong>a Western movement influenced by ancient Greek and Rome within the decorative and visual arts, literature, theater, music, and architecture. Think artist <strong>Nicolas Poussin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enlightenment used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The power of reason</li>
<li>Philosophies sought to reform society</li>
<li>Intellectual exchange</li>
<li>A change from previous system such as the church or tradition</li>
<li>Science which started to displace the authority of religion</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Astronomy</li>

<p>This painting entitled <strong><em>Fruits and Insects</em></strong> by <strong>Rachel Ruysch</strong> is a small <strong>oil on wood</strong> artwork, measuring just <strong>1 foot 4 by 2 feet.  </strong>Still lifes were valued for their extreme realism.</p>
<p>This work shows a profusion of <strong>scientifically accurate floral details</strong>. Look closely at the petals, stems, leaves. Tips are crinkled and brittle, with an emphasis of implied texture in the work.</p>
<p>Ruysch was known for her lively, informal arrangements. Most artists made symmetrical and formal compositions. Also, notice her use of the treatment of light she employs using <strong>tenebrism</strong>:</p>
<p>Scenes, like this one, were a collective observation of many plants and fruit, imaginatively compiled together to create a full composition. Historians know this because many of the components displayed together in still lifes, would not have been grown in the same season.</p>
<h5><strong>The Harvest Scene</strong></h5>
<p>The scene from <strong><em>Fruit and Insects </em></strong>is a harvest.  It features corn, squash, chestnuts, peaches, plum, grapes, wheat, eggs, and a butterfly. Looking at more minute details, one can also see a snail and a fly.</p>

<p>Christians would have seen the wheat as a reference to Eucharist, while the grapes as a symbol of alcohol. Insects play up on the fascination with science and microscopes at the time.</p>

<h5><strong>The Meaning Behind the Work </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Fruit and Insects </em></strong>was painted for Bavarian Prince Johann Wilhelm. He gave it as a gift to Cosimo de’ Medici III as a gift.</p>
<ul>
<li>Represents scientific interest in categorizing the natural world which was becoming popular.</li>
<li>Statement of status (implication is that patron owns all of this)</li>
<li>New affluent middle class desired new kinds of subjects.</li>
<li>They wanted art genres that would reflect their success with genre scenes, still lifes, portraits or landscapes.</li>
<li>No monarchy or Catholic Church in the Netherlands to commission religious or political art</li>
<li>Religious/moral message: <strong>vanitas</strong> (all of this is fleeting)</li>
<li>A reminder that relationship with God is the most important thing of all.</li>
<li>Flowers are iconographic statements of fleeting beauty and shortness of life.</li>
<li>Wealthy Dutch consumers were reminded to not be too attached to their material possessions and worldly pleasures.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Hierarchy of Genre </strong></h5>
<p>Still lifes were considered the lowest in the artistic world’s <strong>Hierarchy of Genre. </strong>It was the first genre students were expected to master. Artist rarely specialized in it. This was not so for female artists. This was as high as they were expected to go. Male counterparts believed they did not have the mental capacity for anything higher!</p>
<p>Painting was considered a hobby for women and not a profession. When women did learn how to paint they were often taught by their husbands or fathers. When they did succeed commercially, they were referred to as “lady painters.”</p>
<h5><strong>Career and Family </strong></h5>
<p>Ruysch was enormously successful in a 60-year career, producing over 250 paintings. For eight of those years, she was a court painter to the Bavarian court for eight years.</p>
<p>She also raised 10 children!</p>
<p>Ruysch grew up in Amsterdam, in a family of Dutch artists and scientist. Her father was a prominent scientist and specialized in botany. He possessed a collection of rare specimens, which she helped him catalogue and record.</p>
<p><strong>The Dutch Golden Age, in the 17<sup>th</sup> century</strong>, fueled an interest in exotic plants and flowers including “Tulip Mania”. Her paintings filled with observations and realistic replications were extremely popular.  And her works sold for double that which Rembrandt’s did at the time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Rococo </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Term derived from the French word <i>rocaille</i> (“shell”) and referred to the small shells used to decorate interiors.</li>
<li>After death of Louis XIV in 1715, French nobility left Versailles and reestablished themselves in Parisian townhouses</li>
<li>Reaction against severe, stuffy formality of Versailles</li>
<li>Secular Rococo interiors were purely intended to delight</li>
<li>Incorporated <strong>interior design</strong> for private viewings: <strong>small sculptures, mirrors, tapestries, elegant furniture, paintings</strong></li>
<li>Decorative; playful, light; graceful; delicate; often erotic</li>
<li><strong>Colors:</strong> white, silver, gold, light pinks, light blues, light greens</li>
<li><strong>Main artists: Watteau (begins Rococo with <i>fête </i><i>galante</i>), Boucher, Fragonard</strong></li>

<p>As the Rococo went out of style, women and femininity were blamed for “weakening” and effeminizing men and France at large.</p>
<p>This political cartoon depicts the frilly, effeminized Rococo painter who foolishly stands up to the strong, masculine, virile Neoclassical painters who represented the next artistic style to develop.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>In 1767 a painter named Doyen was approached by an unknown gentleman who asked the artist if he would come to meet him at his “pleasure house”. These were spaces for men to be with their mistresses. Upon arrival, the gentleman asked Doyen if he would paint his mistress on a swing that a bishop would push. The gentleman would be placed in such a way that he would be able to see up the skirt of his mistress.</p>
<p>Doyen declined by saying “well…thank you for thinking of me but I don’t really paint things like this. However, I know someone who does, and his name is <strong>Fragonard</strong>.”</p>
<p>This painting was the result!</p>
<p>It has been speculated that the patron may have been Baron de Saint-Julien.</p>
<h5><strong>Fun and Frivolity</strong></h5>
<p>This work celebrates the leisure of the upper class. It was painted to be erotically tantalizing. It was meant to represent a game. Gardens are for play. The couple is playing a game. We are playing the game by interpreting the painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Upon Closer Inspection</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>There is a lot going on in this work, which makes it an <strong>intrigue painting. </strong>A scene of scandal, playfulness, and flirtation, suggests a secret love affair. The patron/lover in lower left is looking up the skirt at the young lady who swings while a Bishop pushes her. This could be a possible comment on the corruption of the church.</p>
<p>The garden is fertile, abundant, growing out of control.  This is based on an <strong>English garden</strong>, with controlled and constructed outdoor spaces but have the appearance of being wild and natural, despite still being planned and arranged. Here the figures seem to be in a private park, hidden away.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconographic interpretation</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Swinging</strong> is an association with fickleness and female inconstancy. It is in reference to the act of lovemaking, but swinging is also a reference to a cheating lover.</p>
<p>The <strong>barking dog</strong> might be alluding us to the fact that the scene should be quiet and calm.  The dog does not symbolize fidelity here, rather impatience, carnal desire, animalistic urges, and arousal.</p>
<p>The <strong>pink roses</strong> are a symbol of female genitalia, as is the <strong>pink dress</strong> and shape of the opening.</p>
<p><strong>Shoe coming off</strong> is a common indication of lost virginity and one who has succumbed to passion.</p>
<p><strong>Man’s hat off </strong>at the end of a long slim arm<strong>,</strong> is a symbol of an erection.</p>
<p>The <strong>man is embedded in rose bush</strong> is a symbol of sex.</p>
<p><strong>Rake on the ground</strong> is similar to a crass term for male genitalia in French.</p>
<p>The <strong>shushing cupid</strong> is based on a statue that was in Madame de Pompadour’s home (a famous woman known for love) and heightens the illicit nature of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Dolphins </strong>are a reference to Venus because she was pulled to the shore by dolphins.</p>
<p><strong>Putti </strong>is Cupid’s friends sitting on top of the dolphin.</p>
<p><strong>The garden</strong> is fertile, abundant, and wild with unbridled passion.</p>
<h5><strong>Leisure of the French Aristocracy</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Indulgences</strong> that characterized the French aristocracy before the Revolution included the pursuit of pleasure, and playfulness. Games were very popular. This calls attention to the amount of leisure time they had. Games were also symbols of the poor. It was trendy to “play” poor and simple, like farm girls and peasant boys.</p>
<p>The strict rules of conduct were loosened in these societal situations. Additionally, by participating in these activities, aristocrats believed they received health benefits or relaxation, while stimulating both their senses and intellect. This combated boredom!</p>
<p><strong>Public parks</strong> and <strong>private gardens</strong> were increasingly popular. These were places where flirtatious physical interactions were allowed.</p>
<h5><strong>Aristocrats, Status and Art </strong></h5>
<p>Artistic renderings of aristocrats playing and being frivolous were very popular. Showcasing such works was a sign of status. By definition, aristocrats did not have jobs. They existed to express their status.</p>
<p>There was also a new element of freedom. After the French Revolution and the death of Louis XIV the aristocrats who had previously lived in the rigid ceremonial world of the king, were now free to celebrate themselves.</p>
<h4><strong>Enlightenment</strong></h4>

<p><strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery </em></strong>by artist <strong>Joseph Wright of Derby</strong>, is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> large work measuring <strong>4 feet 10 inches by six feet eight inches</strong>. We would expect to see a history painting in this size, but here the artist is trying to aggrandize the sitters.</p>
<p><strong>Tenebrism</strong> is used for dramatic effect, although it is not religious in content. There is dramatic lighting and scale in a closely packed space, with a Strong internal light source</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong> are painted with extreme <strong>realis</strong>m. (He was criticized for painting people too realistically!) The figures are pushed forward on a picture plane and tightly packed. The philosopher in the middle is obvious, in the center, with the brightest lighting and wearing deep red. Often, <strong>conversation portraits</strong> (images of people sitting around together) were popular and were formally arranged. Wright of Derby was famous for his natural and informal arrangements.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work promotes a belief in science. It is an empirical observation grounded in science and reason that could best advance society. This is still about conversion (light symbolizes conversion) and transformation, but rather unlike <em>Calling of St. Matthew</em> where the conversion is to religion, we are witnessing a conversion to science.</p>
<p>This makes the argument that art and science go together. Artwork shows the power of science. Rachel Ruysch’s work did the same.</p>
<p>The artist took a history painting (large, noble, aggrandizing method) and applied it to a composition with a contemporary secular subject.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery</em></strong><em>, </em>depicts the moment of epiphany or transformation. Here people are witnessing the truth of science. The message is that science is for everyone – look at the wide variety of people who witness this event.</p>
<p>Notice all the figures are seated in a circle around the orrery which emits a central light source.</p>
<ul>
<li>All faces represent different phases of the moon – clever reference to the Lunar Society.</li>
<li>Two young boys gaze over the edge.</li>
<li>A teenage girl rests on the machine, concentrating.</li>
<li>A young man shields his eyes.</li>
<li>A woman stares intently.</li>
<li>A standing man takes notes.</li>
<li>The philosopher stands over the orrery (likely based on Sir Isaac Newton’s portrait – who had died in 1727). Notice the formal devices that make him stand out to us.</li>
<li>Bookshelves in the back indicates he is very educated.</li>
<li>An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system
<ul>
<li>A miniature clockwork planetarium.</li>
<li>Each planet with its moons is a sphere attached to an arm that rotates around the sun when cranked by hand.</li>
<li>Can simulate eclipses and illustrate the rotation of the planets.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Enlightenment</strong> was an 18<sup>th</sup> century philosophical movement that shifted Europe away from traditional religious models and moved towards an empirical, scientific approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Science &gt; religion</li>
<li>Knowledge is for everyone, and knowledge should be democratic.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>English painter <strong>Joseph Wright of Derby (1734 – 1829)</strong> added the region he was born to his professional name, because there was another painter named Joseph Wright, who also lived close by.</p>
<p>Joseph Wright of Derby became the unofficial painter of the Enlightenment. He was known for depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods. The artist belonged to a scientific group called the Lunar Society of Birmingham. This was an informal group that met to talk about scientific topics of the day (Erasmus Darwin – grandfather of Charles Darwin was a member of this group).</p>

<p><strong><em>Spaniard and Indian Produce a Mestizo</em></strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas work</strong>, attributed to <strong>Juan Rodríguez Juárez</strong>. This is an example of an early <strong>casta painting</strong>, depicting inter ethnic mixing of the Europeans and indigenous people of New Spain. It belongs to a larger series of works.</p>
<p>These are not portraits, but characters from the artist’s imagination. The artwork helps to illustrate life in the New World. In the artist earlier works, from which this is an example, he depicts the figures as wealthy and distinguished.</p>
<p>The space in the painting is not defined. This allows the viewer to focus on the figures entirely. These are painted naturally and realistically.</p>
<h5><strong>Marketplace for Casta Paintings </strong></h5>
<p>These works were commissioned by elite Europeans. Many series were commissioned by viceroys. These were to be given to Spanish rulers to illustrate the racial and ethnic mixings in the New World.</p>
<h5><strong>Racism in Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>A series of casta paintings usually contained 16 paintings or even 16 vignettes within one painting. The first in a series showed a European man with an elite indigenous woman and their child or <strong>mestizo</strong>, or racial mix.</p>
<p>As the family trees progressed in additional paintings and races continued to mix, the figures appeared less prominent and wealthy, and they appeared to have a darker skin tone.</p>
<p>Clothing, accoutrements, activities all aid in racially labeling the people in the work. All are numbered with text inscriptions, on the front or back, that label the races in the work.</p>
<p>All the above indicated society’s notion that social status, wealth, and overall worth were directly tied to race.</p>
<h5><strong>A Plus B Equals C</strong></h5>
<p>This image is the first in the series, depicting a husband, wife, and child. This is modeled after depictions of the Holy Family showing the Virgin, St. Joseph, and Christ.</p>
<p>The European father wears French-style European clothing complete with a powdered wig. The indigenous mother is dressed in a <strong>huipl</strong>, a traditional woman’s garment worn by indigenous women from central Mexico. It has lace sleeves. Her sumptuous jewelry indicates to the viewer that she is an aristocratic native. The two types of dress styles help to carry the subject matter of blended families forward.</p>
<p>The child is a racial mix of both parents. The family appears calm, harmonious, and loving. A young servant holds the child while looking up to the baby’s father.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sociedad de Castas</strong> was the racial hierarchy developed in the New World to alleviate social anxieties over mixed-race people. European whites, New World whites, mestizos, indigenous peoples, mulattos, zambos, and African, were some of the descriptions used.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Casta paintings</strong> spoke to Enlightenment concerns, or specifically, the notion that people can be categorized racially based on ethnic makeup and appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Taste for the Natural</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The taste for the natural</strong> was promoted by the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. There was an</p>
<p>interest in the ‘natural’ as opposed to the ‘artificial’. This was a rejection of Baroque artificiality,</p>
<p>and emphasized relaxed, elegant poses and  tall figures with low horizon lines.</p>
<p>The taste for natural promoted the “cult of sensibility” and “cult of domesticity”. Values included sentimentality, emotion, naturalism, and virtue.</p>
<p>Grand Manner portraits dominated, especially in England. This combined Rococo delicacy with classical allusions.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Uffizi</p>
<p><strong><em>Self-portrait</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Elisabeth Louise Vigée-Lebrun </strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 6 inches. </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What does by “The Natural” mean? </strong></h5>
<p>This is not a real style but rather a way of thinking about a trend in portraiture. In fact, these images were designed to look as relaxed, natural, and effortless as possible. This was becoming enormously popular as artists and patrons disliked the pomp, circumstance, and opulence of the Baroque era.</p>
<p>Here you will observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual elegance</li>
<li>Precise nonchalance or contrived to look effortless</li>
<li>Idealized (she was much older here than she appears)</li>
<li><strong>Self-portrait</strong></li>
<li>Well lit, up front towards the picture plane, attention to fabrics is great</li>
</ul>
<p>This<strong> “Natural” </strong>work also uses<strong> Grand Manner Portraiture. </strong>This helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggrandize the sitter</li>
<li>Make them large, in the forefront</li>
<li>Appear gently idealized</li>
<li>Casual yet composed (“studied nonchalance”)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created after <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong> had fled France, following the French Revolution. She was in danger as <strong>a well-known royalist.</strong> She painted it for the Uffizi Gallery in Florence as an addition to their collection of well-known artists’ self-portraits. This put her in league with male painters.</p>

<p>She was able to occupy in a non-threatening manner both worlds&#8211;the world of artists, dominated by men, and the world of femininity.  She shows she can paint just as well as men, and is even friendly with royalty. But, she is not a threat because of her great femininity. She is pretty, demure, soft, gentle, and sophisticated.</p>
<p>Female artists had to traverse a very fine line of showing their talent to be equal to a man, but consoling men and calming them by reminding them that their genders were quite different.</p>
<p>Critics called the artist vain and self-important.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong> was 35 when this was painted. She is looking at the viewer as she paints a portrait of Marie Antoinette. She was Queen Marie Antoinette’s official court painter and personal friend.</p>
<p>In the painting she sits in a relaxed pose at her easel. She looks very pretty. Her skin looks soft, with rosy cheeks, gentle curls, piercing eyes, and flowing silk. She wears a white turban and dark dress with a soft white ruffled collar – in the free-flowing Grecian style. This was inspired by the style that Marie-Antoinette had made popular at the French court. Certainly, not an outfit a painter would paint in. Yet, the brushes are ready along with a palette.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In 1783, <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong>, who specialized in portraiture, was admitted to the French Royal Academy, as the first female member.  Her entrance however was orchestrated by her most important patron&#8211; Marie Antoinette! Now, she certainly deserved to be there, but to many men, it looked like one corrupt woman pulling strings for another woman.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette was deeply disliked at this point in France. Many artists and writers argued that it was Rococo, and by extension women in general, who were leading France down the road to decay.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette, the Rococo excesses, indeed femininity in general, was criticized for having made France and men effeminate. This was blamed for all of France’s problems (debt, corruption, a weak Louis XVI, and a deeply disliked Marie Antoinette). Many believed the only way to end this was revolution.</p>
<p>When the French Revolution occurred, <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong>, had to flee and escape. This work was created soon after her departure from France.</p>
<p>The artist ended up traveling to Italy and Russia to paint nobility and royalty. She was enormously famous in her life and ended up writing an autobiography.</p>

<p><strong><em>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</em></strong> by artist<strong> Miguel Cabrera is an </strong><strong>oil on canvas work </strong>set in realistic space. There is a naturalistic treatment of the body, and it is well-proportioned.   Note the use of variety in the background with color and implied texture.</p>
<p>Once again, we see the “Natural” style with some Grand Manner techniques mixed in. The work is casual, relaxed, and elegant, with a low horizon line, pushed forward, and a larger figure.</p>
<p>We can see the quality of artists have improved over works such <em>Angel with Arquebus</em>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This portrait insists on her status as an intellectual as well as a nun. It ennobles her as an intelligent and pious woman. The work also commemorates Sor Juana 55 years after her death, for admirers, who were likely supporters of Jeronymite order. She was obviously quite a famous Jeronymite nun.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is a famous depiction of the esteemed Mexican nun and writer. Cabrera modeled this painting on images of male scholars seated at their desks.</p>
<p>She wears the <strong>habit</strong> of her religious order and an <strong>escudo de monja</strong> (nun’s badge) on her chest (similar to Sin Sukju). This displayed the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation.</p>
<p>Her <strong>left-hand</strong> toys with her rosary, while she turns a page of an open book with <strong>her right hand</strong>. The book is a text by St. Jerome. This is a contrast between her religious life (rosary) and her intellectual life (books).</p>
<p>She looks towards us, her gaze direct and assertive, as she sits at a desk in her library. We see books on philosophy, natural science, theology, mythology and history.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong>Sor Juana</strong> was born a </span><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">creole</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> (Europeans born in New World) in 1648.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>At age 15, she amazed people at court by excelling at an oral exam that tested physics, philosophy, theology, math, poetry and plays.</li>
<li>Her reward was to live as a lady in waiting at the Viceroy’s House
<ul>
<li>She hated it and soon became a nun to avoid a wedding</li>
<li>Joined Jeronymite order in 1669 as a nun (named for St. Jerome)</li>
<li>In privileged Mexican convents, nuns lived in comfort with servants and households</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She corresponded with scientists, theologians, and other intellectuals, and was a writer</li>
<li>In 1690, she became involved in an ecclesiastical dispute between the bishops of Mexico City and Puebla.
<ul>
<li>She told them they were both wrong and proposed an answer and garnered criticism.</li>
<li>She responded to the criticism she received as a woman writer in a text called <em>The Answer </em>which defended her right as a woman to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite her eloquent defence, the Church forced her to relinquish her literary pursuits and library.
<ul>
<li>She was forced to sell her library, musical and scientific instruments.</li>
<li>She had to write a document that renounced her learning which ended with “I, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the worst in the world” and signed it with her own blood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She fell sick and passed away in 1695 after caring for plague victims.</li>

<p><strong><em>The Tête à Tête </em></strong><strong>from <em>Marriage à la Mode </em></strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> painting by artist <strong>William Hogarth</strong>, measuring  <strong>2 feet and 2 inches by 3 feet. </strong>Hogarth made these oil paintings with an intent to turn them into prints that could be sold to the masses at a reduced rate.</p>
<p>He used <strong>satire</strong> or humor to make a criticism of contemporary lifestyles of the upper classes. He could do this because his was selling the prints to the middle classes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marriage à la Mode </em></strong>means Marriage of the Day or Modern Marriage</p>
<h5><strong><em>Image 1 (Marriage Contract)</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord Squanderfield</strong> has a title but no money. He has squandered  his aristocratic fortunes. Pointing to his family tree, with a medieval knight suggesting a great lineage, he sits with a gout-ridden foot made worse with inactivity. There are Old Master’s paintings on the walls and construction going on outdoors in the new Palladian style.</p>
<p>Here, also sits <strong>a wealthy merchant</strong> without a title. <strong>Lord Squanderfield’s son</strong> and the <strong>merchant’s daughter</strong> are going to marry.</p>
<p>Young Squanderfield is picking snuff out of a box, while looking in the mirror at his own reflection. He has his back turned toward his soon to be bride, with disinterest. Black velvet patches cover syphilis marks.</p>
<p>The daughter sits frumpily and slumped over to show a lack of intelligence, while being wooed by <strong>Silvertongue, her father’s lawyer.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Image 2 (The Tete a Tete) </strong></h5>
<p>Tete to Tete means “head-to-head” or “face to face”.</p>
<p>Shortly after the marriage, each partner has been pursuing pleasures without the other. The <strong>husband</strong> has been out all night with another woman and gambling. The dog sniffs at a bonnet in his jacket, as if assessing what the husband has been up to. The man looks tired and upset. There is a broken sword underneath him indicating a loss.</p>
<p>The <strong>wife</strong> has been playing cards all night. Her bodice is undone. She is yawning. Slyly she is looking out of the corner of her eye to see if he notices. Her lover has just left in a hurry! Notice the turned over chair. The violin player has made a hasty retreat. Violins were symbols of sexual pleasure, in old medieval reference, alluding to what has just taken place.</p>
<p>The <strong>accountant</strong> wears a frustrated expression. He throws his hands up in the air. She has lost a fortune at cards. He just cannot get this couple to take their finances seriously.</p>
<p>The chandelier’s candles have just gone out. They have been burning all evening.  A sculpture with a broken nose has been knocked over on the fireplace mantle. This indicates that although the couple have nice things, they do not bother to take care of them.</p>
<p>There is a nude painting on the back wall, next to three paintings of saints. The nude is covered with a cloth, but it is still visible. It has been covered in a haphazardly way, just like her affair!</p>
<p>A <strong>servant </strong>is yawning in the back room, while rearranging the chairs.</p>
<h5><strong>Image 3 (The Inspection)</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Young Squanderfield</strong>, suffering from syphilis, makes a visit to a <strong>doctor</strong>. Notice the black patches on his neck. Brandishing his cane, he shows the doctor the black mercury pills that do not work.</p>
<p>A <strong>sickly girl</strong> stands in front of him weeping. They both have the disease. The <strong>tall woman</strong> may be her mother or a madame.</p>
<p>The doctor too is riddled with disease.  His office is full of curiosities, including a skull. This could be symbolizing that the disease can cause death.</p>
<h5><strong>Image 4 (The Toilette) </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Lord Squanderfield has died. <strong>Young Squandefield is now the Earl,</strong> and <strong>his wife is now the Countess.</strong></p>
<p>In keeping with the height of fashion, Countess holds a toilette. <strong>Lawyer Silvertongue</strong> lounges, with his shoes off and feet up looking comfortable.</p>
<p>Silvertongue tries to get Countess to attend a masquerade with him because no one will know who they are. Beside him is a book called <em>The Sofa</em>, which was a common erotic novel of the day. There is a coral rope used for teething on the chair where the Countess sits. The baby is not in the artwork to illustrate her poor maternal skills.</p>
<p>The Old Masters’ paintings hanging depict Lot and His Daughters (incest), Jupiter and Io (seduction), and Rape of Ganymede (homosexual seduction).</p>
<h5><strong>Image 5 (The Bagnio)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Squanderfield</strong> catches his <strong>wife</strong> with her lover, <strong>Silvertongue</strong>, in a bagnio, or inn, where rooms could be taken without questions asked. The Earl has burst into the room to find an unmade bed, recently used.</p>
<p>Squanderfield is fatally wounded by Silvertongue, who escapes.  A sword is on the floor The Earl is now dying, while Countess pleads for forgiveness.</p>
<p>The noise has awakened the inn. The Judgment of Solomon on the wall foreshadowing the inevitable destruction of all involved.</p>
<h5><strong>Image 6 (The Lady’s Death)</strong></h5>
<p>Countess returns after her husband’s murder only to commit suicide after Silvertongue is hung for murder. The newspapers on the floor tell the viewer of the hanging.</p>
<p>The child’s legs have braces indicating she has rickets. This was understood at the time to be associated with overindulgence. She also has a black patch, indicating her misfortune of contracting syphilis from her parents. This family tree will come to a tragic end.</p>
<p>The merchant removes the rings from his daughter’s fingers before rigor mortis sets in.</p>
<h4><strong>Social History of the Period</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Marriages in the past had been arranged for economic benefits. However, with the 18<sup>th</sup> century marriages started to be based around love and affection.  <strong>This collection of works showed the downfall of an arranged marriage.</strong></p>

<p>In the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution, the landed aristocracy was losing power to a new upper-middle merchant class or <strong>bourgeoisie. </strong> An increasingly large middle class wanted to buy art  prints.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>English artist <strong>William Hogarth (1697-1764)</strong> trained as a silver engraver and print maker before becoming an artist. His work in oils was self taught.</p>
<p>Hogarth was known for tackling controversial topics. Beer Street and Gin Street were two engraving prints that drew focus to society’s alcoholism.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>Neoclassicism</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Neoclassicism </strong>is a style of art and architecture that emerged in the later 18<sup>th</sup> century as part of a general revival of interest in classical cultures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel to the picture plane</strong></li>
<li><strong>Symmetrical</strong></li>
<li><strong>Linear perspective</strong></li>
<li><strong>invisible brushwork</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clarity of detail</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neoclassical artists</strong> adopted themes and styles from ancient Greece and Rome.  This was Taught within academies, and it returned to Poussinistes.</p>
<p>Grand Tours promoted the value of studying in Italy (Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice)</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the precepts of the Enlightenment</li>
<li>Johann Winckelmann’s books of art theory</li>
<li>1748: Excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii which were Roman cities destroyed by volcanic eruption in 79 CE.</li>
<li>1764: Johann Winckelmann’s <em>History of Ancient Art</em> criticized the excesses of Rococo and celebrated the ancients for their clarity and restraint.</li>

<p><strong><em>Oath of the Horatii</em></strong> an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> <strong>Neoclassical</strong> work by <strong>Jacques-Louis David </strong>measures<strong> 10 feet and 8 inches by 14 feet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Neoclassicism include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classical subject</strong> AKA history painting</li>
<li><strong>Classical</strong> <strong>setting</strong> and architecture and clothing</li>
<li><strong>Figures are parallel</strong> to picture plane, pushed forward like a Roman relief, set in a Roman atrium dominated by three arches at the back, and uses Doric order.</li>
<li>Idealized</li>
<li>Linear perspective</li>
<li><strong>Licked finish</strong> using invisible brushstrokes so small it is as if a cat licked it.</li>
<li>History painting is large size, low horizon line, idealized and large figures, didactic, historical subject.</li>
<li>Tripartite composition</li>
<li>Men: vigorous, powerful, animated, emphatic, muscled arms in rigid salute; comprised of straight strong lines</li>
<li>Women are curvilinear, soft, rounded, collapsed, slumped</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Made for a King</strong></h5>
<p>The patron was <strong>Louis XVI</strong>. France was on the brink of revolution. Louis wanted this to be a statement of loyalty to the monarchy, and he loved this work when it was exhibited.</p>
<h5><strong>Fixing Society Through Art</strong></h5>
<p>David had other ideas – he wanted it to rally republicans as opposed to monarchists. He painted this in Rome after looking at ancient Roman sculpture, paintings, and friezes.  He believed the classics were superior. David wanted to return ancient masculinity and strength to France to reject the frilly, decadent Rococo.</p>
<h5><strong>Political Self-Sacrifice</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Great change will take great sacrifice and great loss. It is still necessary</li>
<li>Must make sacrifices for the greater good</li>
<li>Willingness to die for a principal</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Exemplum virtutis</strong> is a painting that depicts a bold or powerful model of virtue or a didactic moral message.</p>
<p>The story of <strong><em>Oath of Horatii</em></strong> is a legend that was discussed by Roman historian Livy. It is about a conflict between the Romans and rivals in the nearby Alba. The warring had reached a stalemate. To prevent further deaths, three combatants from both sides pledged to fight on behalf of the cities. The Romans selects the three Horatii brothers while the Albans choose the three Curatii brothers.</p>
<p>One of the women on the right is a Horatii engaged to marry a Curatii. One of the sisters of the Curatii is married to a Horatii.</p>

<p>The message is there will be inevitable loss, but you still must make these sacrifices.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>This is the first Neoclassical painting and the birth of Neoclassicism. </strong></p>
<p>In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome, the prize awarded to the best Academy artist. He was able to go to Rome for five years, and study art&#8212; all expenses paid!</p>
<p>After returning, his work was severely undecorated, anti-Rococo, extolled virtues of stoicism, masculinity, patriotism and honor. This was the reaction against the femininity, vanity, lasciviousness, and pleasure pursuing of Rococo.</p>
<p>He exhibited this in at the Salon of 1785 and people were amazed. They had never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>As part of the Neoclassical revival of classical antiquity,</strong> David arranged his figures parallel to the picture plane in the manner of a Greek frieze as seen here with <i>Plaque of the </i><i>Ergastines.</i></p>

<p><strong>Jacques-Louis David (1746-1825)</strong> was a French painter in the Neoclassical style. He was an active supporter of the French Revolution.  He was essentially an art mercenary! He would paint for whoever was in power at that moment. The work above was commissioned for Louis XVI. The artists painted it even though he personally agreed with revolutionaries. Ultimately, he painted Napoléon!</p>

<p><strong><em>George Washington</em></strong><em> a</em><strong><em> marble </em></strong><em>work by</em> <strong>Jean-Antoine Houdon </strong>is a life-sized sculpture standing<strong> 6 feet 2 inches. </strong> It is <strong>Neoclassical</strong> in style, but the American version is “down to earth,” simple, and less dramatic.</p>
<p>Based on Polykleitos’ Doryphoros</p>
<ul>
<li>Revives the restraint and idealism and control of classical Greek art (rationalism)</li>
<li>His stance mimics that of the <strong>contrapposto</strong>; sculpture in the round</li>
<li>Idealized, noble, casual pose</li>
<li>Alternation of tense/relaxed; straight/bent</li>
<li>Left as bare marble à recalls the idealization and simplicity of classical statuary</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was designed to commemorate <strong>George Washington</strong>. Its aim was to show that a legendary leader was also an ideal leader, capturing the <strong>duality</strong>. He was a humble private citizen and an honorable public servant.</p>
<p>This was commissioned by the Virginia legislature and installed in the capitol rotunda in 1796. This was the year Washington gave his farewell address.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This shows George Washington as a public servant. He does not wear a toga or other classical garment, but instead wears his military uniform.</p>
<p>Left arm rests atop a <strong>fasces</strong> (where the word fascism comes from). This is meant to invoke a classical column. Fasces was given to Roman slaves to symbolize their freedom.</p>
<p>The <strong>bundle of 13 rods</strong> symbolizes the original colonies. His hand rests on top showing that he unifies these colonies but also that he draws strength from them. This visually represents the concept of E Pluribus Unum – Out of Many, One. (Congress approved this in 1782)</p>
<p>Does not hold <strong>his officer’s sword</strong>, it hangs on the outside of the fasces, just outside his reach. This signifies he can be strong but should not immediately resort to this.</p>
<p>He is a private citizen. The plow rests behind Washington and reminds us that he is a simple man tied to the earth. This refers to the story of Roman dictator Cincinnatus, who resigned when his leadership, so he could return to his farm (rather than Caesar who created absolute power for himself). This parallel shows how Washington turned down the office and stepped away from the Presidency.</p>
<p>The <strong>walking stick</strong> symbolizes that Washington was well-known as a man who loved to stroll his estate. This is evidence that power does not have to corrupt</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>After the end of the Revolutionary War, the new American government turned to public art to commemorate the occasion and develop an American identity</li>
<li>European sculptor had to be sought out since there was a lack of artistic talent in US colonies
<ul>
<li>Jefferson, ambassador to France, suggested Jean-Antoine Houdon</li>
<li>Houdon went to the Academy in Paris and won the Prix de Rome in 1761. He was famous neoclassical sculptor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you create a new nation’s imagery/symbols? What is art’s role in this?</li>
<li>Houdon created an idealized, classical bust of Washington</li>
<li>Washington didn’t like it and insisted on being shown in contemporary attire</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monticello </strong>created by<strong> Thomas Jefferson </strong>is a structure crafted with<strong> brick, glass, stone, and wood. </strong>It is in<strong> Virginia, US. </strong>The floor plan is not very Neoclassical. Jefferson planned this part before he was influenced by Neoclassicism, but by then it had already been built.</p>
<p>Monticello was inspired by Palladian classicism (Villa Rotunda) and Pantheon.</p>
<p>The <strong>west garden façade view</strong> has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetrical three-story brick home, balanced</li>
<li>Doric entablature; two-column extended portico; four Doric columns wide</li>
<li>Triangular pediment decorated by a semi-circular window</li>
<li>Octagonal drum and shallow dome</li>
<li>Wooden balustrade that circles roofline</li>
<li>Brick building, stucco applied to give the look of marble</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Made from Scratch</strong></h5>
<p>Jefferson chose to make his own bricks from the clay on his land. He used local timber, stone, and locally made nails. This saved him a great deal of money&#8212; as did the slave labor!</p>
<h5><strong>Symmetrical Interior Design</strong></h5>
<p>The numerous, tall French doors and windows allow for circulation in humid Virginia.</p>
<p>Jefferson was obsessed with saving space. There is a very narrow spiral staircase. Beds are in alcoves or in walls.</p>
<p>As he disliked dark and cold corners, he preferred a nice octagonal room.</p>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>This was both a<strong> domestic space </strong>and a<strong> private space, </strong>as it was a plantation home.<strong>  </strong>It was built for comfort, entertainment, personal style. These were new ideas. The fact that architecture could display these things was a new and very modern idea in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<h5><strong>Picking A Style</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Jefferson’s choice was sure to display religious and political ideas. He needed to choose carefully and avoid certain styles.</p>
<p><strong>French Baroque</strong> would have connections to Louis XIV and absolutism. Jefferson felt <strong>English Baroque</strong> was too British for an American audience.  <strong>Italian Baroque </strong>was considered too Catholic and religious, and Jefferson did not want to set a religious precedent. <strong>Rococo</strong> was too frilly, playful, and lacked seriousness.</p>
<p><strong>Neoclassicism</strong> embodied democracy, aspirations, the classics, freedom, and civic pride. It symbolized a return to <strong>democratic traditions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jefferson believed art was a powerful tool and could encourage American aspirations.</li>
<li>Classics symbolized aspirations of the new American republic.</li>
<li>Classics symbolized America was the inheritor of classical democracy.</li>
<li>Classics invoked ideas regarding freedom, self-determination, prosperity, education, democracy, and civic responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Jefferson was one of the earliest supporters of <strong>Neoclassical architecture</strong> in US. He was considered a “gentleman architect”, who was not a professional but highly educated.</p>
<h5><strong>Timeline</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1768:</strong> Construction begins. The hill was cleared and leveled through slave labor.</p>
<p><strong>1771:</strong>  First phase (foundation) was completed (Neoclassicism hasn’t been invented yet).</p>
<p><strong>1784-1789</strong>: Jefferson left for France as an American minister. He observed Neoclassicism in France/Italy.</p>
<p><strong>1789:</strong></p>
<p>Returned to Monticello and began to redesign it along French neoclassicism lines. He was already stuck with a floorplan which is not very Neoclassical. But he changed the interior and exterior design to add Neoclassical elements</p>
<p><strong>1809:</strong> The house was finished.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 4.4 Theories and Interpretations of Later European and American Art</strong></h5>
<p>Art of this era often proved challenging for audiences and patrons to immediately understand. The study of art history is shaped by different theories and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated, and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Two Fridas </em></strong>by Mexican artist <strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 5 feet 7 inches by 5 feet 7 inches. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Surrealism</strong> is meant to puzzle or challenge the viewer. It often shows dream–like scenes with a psychological focus. This double self-portrait is in a Surrealist, unclear, confusing space. The space is flat, with an even balance, split evenly up and down, with a focus on the foreground.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychological</strong>: examines her inner feelings as a self-portrait study</li>
<li>Surrealists want to examine inner states, psychological states of mind</li>
<li>Reveals the deep hurt over losing her husband, her culturally mixed heritage, the harsh reality of her medical conditions, and the repression of women</li>
<li>Shows the ultimately conflicted personal feelings of Frida</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Two seated figures hold hands and share a bench in front of a stormy sky. They are <strong>identical twins except for their attire.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>On the <strong>left side</strong>, rejected Frida wears <strong>Victorian/German clothing</strong>. She has a clamping vein, and her blouse is ripped open to reveal her weak and exposed heart. There is a sense of vulnerability.</p>
<p>On the <strong>right side</strong>, Rivera still loves her. Frida’s heart is still whole. She wears the <strong>indigenous dress</strong> that Rivera preferred her to wear. The vein feeds his portrait. Her heart is strong and secure. Her skin is darker.</p>
<p>She is both women at once. They are linked through blood and gesture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where one is weakened by an exposed heart (L), the other is strong (R).</li>
<li>Where one still pines for her lost love (R), the other clamps down on that (L)</li>
<li>Blood is a metaphor of union</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Frida Kahlo (1907-1954)</strong> was a mostly untrained painter who found refuge from pain throughout her life in art. She painted almost 200 self-portraits.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Two Fridas </em></strong>was completed during her divorce from Diego Rivera.</p>
<p>She married Rivera in 1929. They each had affairs. Kahlo’s affairs were with men and women.</p>
<p>Kahlo’s father was German, and her mother was Mexican. Rivera encouraged her to abandon her Germanic/Western heritage and wear traditional Mexican clothing instead.</p>
<p>In an era when women wore elaborate hairstyles and clothing, <strong>Kahlo was a rebellious loner who wore indigenous clothing</strong> and did not shave. This was seen as very transgressive. During this time most women were domestic housewives. <strong>Kahlo was a businesswoman and artist.</strong></p>
<p>In her paintings <strong>she often depicted physical deformities</strong>. She had polio as a child, which deformed her right leg. A bus accident when she was 18 caused her to be impaled through her groin which left her unable to walk for many months. Ultimately, she was unable to have children. She had severe scarring and deformity of the uterus. As a result, she underwent 32 operations. All these things challenged the definition of femininity.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Pop Art performance art</p>

Site-specific</p>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> by artist <strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was made entirely of reflective <strong>mirror balls</strong> of highly polished stainless steel. Each mirror ball measured eight inches across. There was a total of 1500 balls in the original <strong>installation</strong>. Later, she would recreate the installation around the globe in a multitude of versions and settings.</p>
<p>This work is considered <strong>performance art</strong>. This means artwork that is a performance, time sensitive, and only preserved in photographs. In this case, viewers could see themselves and their surroundings in the work. It expressed the idea of illusion and infinity.</p>
<h5><strong>Based on Mythology</strong></h5>
<p>The title of this work has a reference to the classics. <strong>Narcissus</strong> the mythological hunter, fell in love with his reflection in a pool. <strong>Narcissism</strong> is the egotistical admiration of one’s own self.</p>
<h5><strong>The Message</strong></h5>
<p>The work was a critique of the narcissism of art world and commercialization. Monetary exchange between Kusama and her customers underscored the economic system in art production and exhibition.</p>
<p>It also spoke of the pressure on artists to sell artwork, an experience, their brand, and the need for self-promotion. They must market and promote themselves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> became more and more popular. The balls became collector’s items.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Narcissus Garden</em></strong> was first installed in the <strong>Venice Biennale</strong>, a major contemporary art show in 1966. Yet, the artists had not officially been invited to exhibit!</p>
<p>This work of<strong> performance art </strong>was originally on a grass lawn on which <strong>Kusama</strong> set 1,500 mirror balls on. She was dressed in a gold kimono. Each ball was sold for 1,200 lira ($2). There was a sign that said, “Your narcissism for sale!”</p>
<p>Venetian authorities reprimanded her and fined her.</p>
<p>A<strong> happening is a term</strong> coined in late 1950s to describe performance art that is initially planned but <strong>involves spontaneity, improvisation, and audience participation</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> was born in 1929. She is a self-taught artist who has now chosen to live in a Tokyo mental facility.</p>
<p>She had difficulty finding acceptance in the art world as both a woman and foreigner. She also lived in a society recovering from WWII prejudice against Japan.</p>
<p>Mirrors and repetition are a theme in her artwork, as she says it helps her to process her insanity. She reminds the viewer that Pop Art didn’t just focus on consumer culture (celebrities, soup cans) but also on our own vanity and ego</p>

<p><strong><em>Spiral Jetty</em></strong> by artist<strong> Robert Smithson </strong>is an<strong> Earthwork </strong>made from <strong>mud, precipitated salt crystals, rocks, and water coil, </strong>located in<strong> Great Salt Lake, Utah, US. </strong>It measures<strong> 1,500 feet long.</strong></p>
<p>An<strong> Earthwork</strong> is a site-specific piece, set outdoors in the West made of natural materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiral Jetty </em></strong><strong>is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Located at Rozel Point peninsula on the Northeast shore of the Great Salt Lake</li>
<li>All materials are from this site</li>
<li>Over 6,000 tons of black basalt rock</li>
<li>Coil is 1,500 feet long and 15 feet wide that winds counterclockwise off the shore into the water</li>
<li>Dump trucks and tractors took six days</li>
<li>The <strong>artist was insistent</strong> about switching rocks around to create the look he wanted</li>
<li><strong>Water level varies</strong> with precipitation in the mountains
<ul>
<li><strong>Jetty is revealed in times of drought and submerged in times of normal precipitation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lake is naturally pink or red</strong> due to bacteria and algae that thrive in the saline water</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Who was this Work Made For?</strong></h5>
<p>This is a question that many people ask. The <strong>location is remote</strong> (100 miles NW of Salt Lake City) and <strong>difficult to get to</strong> (a 15-mile dirt road from highway with potholes so big VW beetles get stuck in them).</p>
<p>This work <strong>challenges traditional notions about art in a gallery space</strong>. It also expands the definition of the art object.</p>
<p><strong>Spiral Jetty </strong>requires the viewer’s engagement to walk out along it and experience it.</p>
<h5><strong>A Disappearing Medium</strong></h5>
<p>Also, this work does not have the power of longevity. <strong>Entropy</strong> is the decline into disorder, inevitability of time and the disintegration of all objects in nature. It is the power of natural forces over man-made forces. The jetty will naturally disappear over time.</p>
<p>Originally the work was almost all black basalt, but salt encrustation has turned it a pinkish white.</p>
<p>Not only will nature erode its own work, but human experience (viewers walking) will erode it too.</p>
<p>This draws attention to <strong>environmental issues</strong>. What is our human effect on the environment? How can we preserve it?</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Spiral Jetty </strong>is a three-part artwork:</p>
<ol>
<li>sculpture</li>
<li>essay by Smithson</li>
<li>film documenting the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>coil shape</strong>, the artist believed, was a shape that was natural and organic. Unlike Modernist squares and circles and more geometric forms, <strong>coils suggest growth and decay</strong>, a perpetual cycle</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Background</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Smithson leased the site</strong> for a small annual fee and <strong>contracted the construction</strong> with money given to him by a New York gallery. He was interested in this site because it was where an abandoned industrial site had left machinery on the coast to decay. This made him think about decay and man versus nature. Also, the American Southwest had vast open spaces, seen as quintessential in unspoiled nature.</p>
<p>The sculpture is now owned by the state of Utah.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>

<p>Artist <strong>Robert Smithson</strong> started out creating paintings and collages before moving to sculpture, which he assembled using scattered materials. Soon, he moved his works out of galleries and into landscapes.</p>
<p>He was best known for his <strong>Earthwork</strong> or <strong>Land art.</strong></p>
<p>Smithson died in a plane crash in 1973. He was 35.</p>

<h5><strong>TOPIC 4.3 </strong><strong>Materials, Processes, and Techniques in Later </strong><strong>European and American Art</strong></h5>
<p>In the mid-19th century, <strong>advances in technology,</strong> such as the <strong>steel frame</strong>, <strong>ferro concrete construction</strong>, and <strong>cantilevering</strong>, hastened the development of building construction. Skyscrapers proliferated and led to an international style of architecture that was later challenged by postmodernism.</p>
<p>Artists employed <strong>new media</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lithography</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Film</li>
<li>Serigraphy</li>
</ul>
<p>They used industrial technology and prefabrication, as well as many new materials, to create innovative and monumental works, culminating with massive earthworks. The advent of mass production supplied artists with ready images, which they were quick to appropriate. Performance was enacted in novel ways and recorded on film and video.</p>

<p><strong><em>Still Life in Studio</em></strong> by artist<strong> Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre </strong>is a work of<strong> photography.</strong></p>
<h5>What is a <strong>Daguerreotype?</strong></h5>
<p>Each produced a single image (the “negative” is the plate/photo). These images are one of a kind, and there is no way to reproduce them.</p>
<h5><strong>The Process</strong></h5>
<p>The artist <strong>took a plate of silver-plated copper</strong> and exposed it to <strong>iodine</strong> to make it light sensitive. Then he <strong>exposed it to light in the camera</strong>.</p>
<p>Initially, this light exposure took about eight hours. Later technology improved and ranged depending on how much light was present. The stronger the light, the less the exposure needed. For example, in the middle of the day there was ample light.</p>
<p>At this point, <strong>mercury fumes</strong> would develop. This was stabilized with <strong>salt water</strong> (<strong>hypo</strong>)*. This step was added after they realized the plates continued to develop through being exposed to light. Many early images have simply turned black.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This work was experimentation only and not made for a patron. The artist wanted to make a permanent image using light and chemistry.</p>
<h5><strong>Art or Science </strong></h5>
<p>A medium of artistic expression?  A powerful scientific tool? What use could it possibly be for? It could be so easily manipulated and wasn’t powerful enough yet to capture great details or small objects.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Still lifes were common</strong>.  This was not point and click photography! With an exposure time of up to eight hours, anything other than still lifes was difficult to take photos of.  Even sitting completely still for ten to fifteen minutes without moving was challenging.</p>
<p>The earliest <strong>daguerreotypes</strong> were still lifes with plaster casts of antique sculpture. For practical reasons white casts reflected light well. Still lifes were immobile during long exposures.</p>
<p>For <strong>symbolic reasons </strong>white casts lent an aura of “art” and “classicism” to photos and helped to legitimize them.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The principle of a camera had been discussed since antiquity, but it wasn’t discovered until 19<sup>th</sup> century. Think of Vermeer’s camera obscura.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre’s</strong> (1787-1852) had been searching since the mid-1820s for a way to take a photo using light and chemistry. By 1829, he showed his new medium at both the Science Academy and Fine Arts Academy in Paris. Even from the start, it was unclear where photography would fit best.</p>
<p>This is one of only about 25 of Daguerre’s images to survive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art</em></strong> a work by French born artist<strong> Honoré Daumier </strong>is a<strong> lithograph.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Clearly this is not a photograph, however, it is grouped here so that we can continue to think about photographic developments throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h5><strong>Lithograph </strong>(what Daumier used)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Keeps the sketchy, “drawing-like” quality that cannot be captured in a woodcut, engraving, or etching and makes this reproducible like a print.</li>
<li>Hinges on the principal that water and oil cannot mix.</li>
<li>An image is drawn onto a stone slab with an oily crayon.</li>
<li>Water is then rolled over the stone.</li>
<li>The oily crayon repels the water, and the stone absorbs the water because it is porous.</li>
<li>Oil is rolled over the stone. The oil adheres to the oily crayon but is repelled from the areas where there is water.</li>
<li>Paper (with high cotton content) is applied to top to transfer image using pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Collodion</strong> (what Nadar used in the image)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Take a glass plate</li>
<li>Coat gun cotton (aka collodion) on it à this is light sensitive and stays wet</li>
<li>Expose plate to light (exposure time of 3-5 minutes) (1% of original time of daguerreotypes)</li>
<li>Must develop plate while wet à anywhere you took the photo, you had to have a portable darkroom with you.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a<strong> satire</strong>. It mocks both the difficulties of the method and the uncertain status of photography. It mocks the <strong>literal and figurative elevation of art.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daumier</strong> believed it would take more than just going “up” to elevate photography to fine art. He did not believe photography was art. This was done in response to a French court decision in 1862 that determined that photos could be considered works of art.</p>
<p>This incited a large amount of mockery regarding photography.</p>
<h5><strong>What Do We See?</strong></h5>
<p>Nadar is a mad-scientist or absent-minded professor. After the perfect shot, he is about to lose his top hat, and tumble out of his hot air balloon. He will do anything for art!</p>
<p>What kind of photo is he taking? <strong>A collodion photo</strong>. The difficulty with these photos is you must develop it instantly! That means, not only is he struggling to get the perfect photo up in this blustery hot air balloon, but he also has a portable darkroom with him.</p>
<p>Below, every building in Paris has “<em>photographie</em>” written on it. Not only is all of Paris apparently “photo-worthy” to photographers (something that those who didn’t like photography thought ridiculous), but it will literally become a popular subject for photographers.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Nadar</strong> was known for capturing the <strong>first aerial photographs from the basket of a hot air balloon in 1858.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daumier’s</strong> lithograph (and what Nadar had done in the hot air balloon) touched on a controversial subject. People felt the photo took pictures of them without their permission. Later, in 1870, the government bought Nadar’s balloon for surveillance purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Daumier’s </strong>print captured the anxieties over the accelerated growth, industrialization, and changes regarding privacy in Paris, France, and Europe.</p>
<p>There was a 19<sup>th</sup> century debate over whether photography could be considered “art”. Some people said photography was just “worse painting”. They said it didn’t capture any of the emotion of painting. It was thought that it didn’t require any skill and that you just pushed a button.  It was said to eliminate the artist altogether. Or that anyone could do it without training!  Others said it would never have a use for science.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>The Horse in Motion</em></strong> by<strong> Eadweard Muybridge </strong>is an<strong> Albumen print. </strong></p>
<h5><em> </em><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Dry glass plate method</strong>:</p>
<p>This is the same process as collodion method, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not have to develop while wet (uses dry collodion instead)</li>
<li>Reduced exposure time to 1/25<sup>th</sup> of a second (allows you to photograph moving objects)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How did he do it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Muybridge</strong> set up a row of cameras with tripwires. Each would trigger a picture for a split second as the horse ran by.</p>
<p>Now, how did Muybridge replicate the photos for publication in a magazine?</p>
<p><strong>Albumen print</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take a dry glass photo</li>
<li>Coat with silver nitrate (which is light sensitive)</li>
<li>Take paper</li>
<li>Coat with egg white (albumen) and salt</li>
<li>Place wet side of glass with wet side of dry glass plate</li>
<li>Expose to light</li>
<li>Light helps the image to soak onto the paper and transfer the image over</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Muybridge was commissioned</strong> by Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University, governor of California and horseman. The work was designed to settle the question of whether a horse ever takes all four legs completely off the ground during a gallop. The human eye is not capable of breaking down such a fast action.</p>
<p>Stanford had made a $25,000 bet ($605,000 today) that all the hooves did come off the ground.</p>
<p>He hired <strong>Muybridge</strong> to prove he was right. He paid <strong>Muybridge </strong>$42,000 THEN (today, that is $1,018,000.00 +)</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>12 photographs</strong> shot in rapid succession</li>
<li>Shows that, yes, <strong>a horse does bring all four hooves off the ground</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This marked <strong>a new purpose for photography</strong>. It really could <strong>answer scientific questions</strong>. Photographic <strong>technology</strong> could do something that humans couldn’t do.</p>
<p>Interestingly, people did not believe these pictures were real, accusing him of forging them.</p>
<p>Photography now was used for a scientific purpose.</p>
<p>People were still skeptical.  What skill or talent did it take? It could be manipulated. It wasn’t artful</p>
<p><strong>Muybridge’s stop motion technique was an early form of animation that helped pave the way for the motion picture industry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zoetrope</strong>: instructions came in magazines to cut out the strips, place them in a circle and tape together the ends, lock through holes on the top and then spin it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building</em></strong> by architect<strong> Louis Sullivan</strong> was constructed from <strong>steel, glass, and terra cotta. </strong>The building stands in <strong>Chicago, Illinois, US. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Sullivan</strong> wrote his treatise on skyscraper architecture <strong>The Tall Office Building Considered Artistically</strong> in 1896. He was a pioneer of American commercial architecture.</p>
<p>Examples of <strong>Chicago Style</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>clean and streamlined</li>
<li>grid-like</li>
<li>simple with little to no ornamentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This type of architecture got its start in Chicago</strong>, hence the name.</p>
<p><strong>Sullivan</strong> coined the term <strong>form follows function</strong>. If form followed tradition or precedent, it would look classical.  With this architect’s method a building would reflect or telegraph its purpose. This is why we think buildings “look like prisons” or “look like banks” today.</p>

<p>The gorgeous entryway is made of <strong>cast iron.</strong> The decorative program gave the building a chance to be distinguished from buildings around it. This made it more attractive to potential customers. A pedestrian’s eye will be immediately attracted to the bronze-colored ground floor.</p>
<p>The ornamentation is <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> a style that embraced natural decorative elements, twisting, ornate, curling vines, floral elements.</p>
<h5><strong>Context:</strong></h5>
<p>The late 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century in America saw the increase of wealth for the middle class. It became a consumer culture. Department stores and banking/offices needed to be built.</p>
<p>There was now a professionalization of jobs and an increase in white-collar jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Metropolitan and Getty have copies</p>
<p><strong><em>The Steerage </em></strong>by <strong>Alfred Stieglitz </strong>is a<strong> photogravure.</strong></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, a <strong>photogravure</strong> is not a photograph, because the image isn&#8217;t made in a darkroom.  The <strong>negative is transferred onto a copper plate coated with gelatin</strong>. The plate is <strong>dipped in a succession of etching acid baths</strong>, which eat away at the darker areas of the plate which have more gelatin. Next, the artist <strong>prints the image with ink.</strong></p>
<p>Why would you use this? It is <strong>one of the best methods to mass produce large editions of photographs</strong> that are good quality. They have a very sensual velvety feel.</p>
<p>This is a study of composition, shape, rhythm, value, and line. Photography can capture abstraction in the same manner that painting can.</p>
<p><strong>The artist explained:</strong></p>
<p><em>A round straw hat, the funnel leading out, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railings made of circular chains – white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape.</em></p>
<p><em> I stood spellbound for a while, looking and looking. Could I photograph what I felt, looking and looking and still looking? I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life. […] </em></p>
<p><em>Spontaneously I raced to the main stairway of the steamer, chased down to my cabin, got my Graflex, raced back again all out of breath, wondering whether the man with the straw hat had moved or not. If he had, the picture I had seen would no longer be. The relationship of shapes as I wanted them would have been disturbed and the picture lost.</em></p>
<p><em>But there was the man with the straw hat. He hadn’t moved. The man with the crossed white suspenders showing his back, he too, talking to a man, hadn’t moved. And the woman with a child on her lap, sitting on the floor, hadn’t moved. Seemingly, no one had changed position. […] [It] would be a picture based on related shapes and on the deepest human feeling, a step in my own evolution, a spontaneous discovery.</em></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Stieglitz’s</strong> function was to argue for the <strong>elevation of photography to a fine art</strong>. It was an argument for <strong>photography’s merits. </strong>The <strong>emphasize was on how photography is different than painting. </strong></p>
<p>Considered the first modernist photograph – why? Prior to this, photographers had tried to always emulate painting (think of <em>Still Life in Studio</em>).</p>
<p>Photography’s strengths are clarity and realism. This was the first photo that did not aim to emulate painting in style and subject matter.</p>
<p>There was an unintended function. It became associated with Documentary Photography and journalism. It also conveyed a message about its subjects and immigrants, even though this wasn’t Stieglitz’s intent.</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Upper and lower-class immigrants and travelers together on a boat</li>
<li>Formal arrangements of diagonals, colors, tones</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Stieglitz </strong>ran an art gallery and published many art journals, that focused on photography</p>
<p>He was familiar with the debates about immigration reform and the ghastly conditions that steerage passengers were subjected to. Interestingly, Stieglitz, the son of a German immigrant, was opposed to admitting the uneducated and marginal to the USA.</p>
<p>Stieglitz’s wife Emmeline and their daughter were going to France. Emmeline was from a wealthy family, and Stieglitz was very class-conscious. Here is what he had to say about it.</p>
<p><em>How I hated the atmosphere of the first class on that ship. One couldn’t escape the &#8216;nouveau riches.&#8217; [&#8230;] On the third day out I finally couldn’t stand it any longer. I had to get away from that company. I went as far forward on the deck as I could [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p><em> As I came to the end of the desk I stood alone, looking down. There were men and women and children on the lower deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading up to the upper deck of the steerage, a small deck at the bow of the steamer. To the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage deck there was fastened a gangway bridge which was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone. On the upper deck, looking over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck. Only men were on the upper deck. The whole scene fascinated me.  </em></p>

<p><strong><em>The Kiss </em></strong>by artist<strong> Constantin Brancusi </strong>is a<strong> stone sculpture</strong> measuring<strong> 1 foot 10 inches tall. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a </strong>Subtractive sculpture in the round. It has no negative space. The emphasis is on the original/starting shape of the block of stone. This is an <strong>abstraction</strong> of human bodies.</p>
<p>The <strong>right angles of the elbows</strong> align with and emphasize the block. A single incised line separates the two figures. This leaves the block very raw. Its <strong>emphasis is on cubic quality and the rough surface</strong>. This was radical. Donatello, Michelangelo, Houdon – emphasized the technical finish. Rodin began to “roughen” up sculpture, and this was a total disregard of academic finish.</p>
<p>The work is <strong>not on a pedestal</strong> and is meant to be directly on the ground. This takes the sculpture out of the academic realm.</p>
<p>This work is a <strong>manipulation of the human body</strong> to fit form, rather than to fit style.</p>
<p>It is a <strong>rejection of academic tradition</strong>: idealization, finish, scale, size, and pedestal.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>1) Redefine sculpture and start where his teacher Rodin left off</li>
<li>2) Reject authority and strictures of the academy</li>
<li>3) Be inspired by primitivism</li>
<li>4) Show a modern take on a traditional subject (lovers)</li>
<li>5) Attempt to maintain the materiality of the stone (make content fit form, not content fit style)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong>Two half-length figures</strong> who hold each other tight in an embrace.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis is on the union of these two figures</li>
<li>Female figure: longer hair, slight suggestion of breasts, eye is smaller</li>
<li>Just like Klimt’s version – in terms of the union of the figures</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) </strong>was not technically a cubist, but he was inspired by Cubism. He was a student of Rodin’s.  The mentor broke rules about the idealization of sculptural figures. He took issue with the classical ideal.</p>
<p><strong>Brancusi</strong> took what his teacher did a step further. <strong>Brancusi</strong> was an outsider to modernism (like Munch as a Norwegian was). He was Romanian and went to the Academy in Bucharest.</p>
<p><strong>Brancusi </strong>was inspired by primitivism (African art), as well as Assyrian and Egyptian art.</p>

<p><strong>Fallingwater </strong>by American architect<strong> Frank Lloyd Wright </strong>is a building constructed of <strong>stone </strong>that stands in<strong> Fallingwater, Pennsylvania. </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Prairie Style</strong> gets its name from its long horizontal lines, inspired by the prairies and plains. <strong>Fallingwater </strong>is integrated into the landscape, horizontal lines, horizontal windows, restraint in decoration and a stacked quality.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> called this his “organic architecture,” inspired by Transcendentalism. Most materials came from the site or broader area.  It is central and natural with an <strong>in situ </strong>stone core for the fireplace.</p>
<p>The color palette is limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>light ochre (yellowy tan)</li>
<li>“Cherokee red” based on natural rock color</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <strong>liberal use of glass</strong>. The house has no walls facing the waterfall. <strong>Corner-turning windows</strong> do not use mullions and create unbroken views of nature. <strong>Elongated horizontal windows</strong> encourage the viewer to look outside.</p>
<p>The architecture creates the Illusion that the stream flows through the house. The powerful falls is heard from every room.</p>
<p>The <strong>ceilings are low</strong> reaching only up to 6 feet and 4 inches.  This encourages you to move towards the windows for the feeling of openness.</p>
<p>The <strong>floor is polished with wax</strong> to give it the appearance of wetness.</p>
<p>The house is darkest at the entrance and gets lighter as you move towards the back by the windows.</p>
<p>The use of <strong>cantilever</strong> construction allowed <strong>Wright</strong> to hang the house over the falls. Cantilever is a long projecting beam that has reinforcing wire-mesh and steel bars embedded inside of it to increase tensile strength. He used reinforced concrete or <strong>ferroconcrete.</strong></p>
<p>Edgar Kaufmann Sr, the Pittsburgh department store tycoon, commissioned <strong>Wright</strong> to build <strong>Fallingwater.</strong> Kaufmann sent a copy of <strong>Wright’s</strong> blueprints to his personal engineer who found the ground of <strong>Fallingwater</strong> unstable and dimensions of the cantilever untenable. He did not recommend that <strong>Wright </strong>proceed with the house. The architect was upset but permitted an increase in the number and diameter of the structure’s steel reinforcements.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This was created as a <strong>private home</strong> and weekend retreat for the Kaufmann family.</p>
<p>The clients were very interested in modern art and <strong>Wright’s</strong> work. It was <strong>a sign of status</strong> to have a weekend home.</p>
<p>The house was <strong>designed to be in harmony with nature</strong>. It is not just plunked down on top of the waterfall. It looks like it has grown out organically. It tumbles downward and outward like the waterfall itself.</p>

<p>Wright <strong>designed the original interior furnishings</strong>. Notice the designs are simple and matching the exterior in colors and materials.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First floor:</strong> living room, kitchen</li>
<li><strong>Second floor:</strong> three bedrooms</li>
<li><strong>Third floor:</strong> study and bedroom of son, Edgar Kaufmann Jr.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The mid 1930s were bad years for American architecture. It was the time of the <strong>Great Depression</strong>. Almost no private homes were built.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> and his wife were struggling to keep Taliesin, his studio/home, out of foreclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> was also being viewed by his contemporaries as “out of style”. In a review of architecture in 1932, he was criticized for his “unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries”.</p>
<p>Philip Johnson, the designer of the Seagram Building, would call <strong>Wright</strong> the “greatest architect of the 19<sup>th</sup> century” to jab at how old and outdated he was.</p>
<p><strong>Wright </strong>developed an apprenticeship program called “the fellowship” to create business. Edgar Kaufmann Jr. was one of his first apprentices.</p>
<p>Kaufmann Sr. asked Wright about making a summer home for his family. They owned a large chunk of property in this area but the spot with the waterfall was their favorite.  <strong>Wright </strong>visited the site in December 1934. He rejected a conventional view of the waterfall and wanted to make the house a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Wright </strong>procrastinated for 9 months until Kaufmann Sr. called and said he was driving 140 miles to Taliesin to see what Wright had done.</p>
<p>Apprentice Edgar Taffel said: <em>Wright briskly emerged from his office, sat down at the table with the plot plan and started to draw. The design just poured out of him. ‘Lilian and Edgar will have tea on the balcony…they’ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods…’ Pencils were being used up as fast as we could sharpen them. Erasures, overdrawing, modifying, flipping sheets back and forth. Then, the title across the bottom was scribbled: ‘Fallingwater.’</em></p>
<p>The whole process took two hours.</p>
<p><strong>Wright</strong> was influenced by <strong>Transcendentalism</strong> meaning all nature and humanity are connected. He was also <strong>influenced by Japanese architecture</strong> and wanted to create harmony between man and nature.</p>

Architecture</p>
<p><strong><em>Seagram Building </em></strong>in <strong>New York City </strong>was designed by <strong>architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, with interior furnishings by Philip Johnson</strong>. Constructed from <strong>steel with a glass curtain wall and bronze </strong>the building measures 515 feet tall with 38 stories. When it was constructed, the cost was astronomical an $36 million dollars.</p>
<p><em> </em><strong>Mies</strong> believed that “<strong>Less is More</strong>”</p>
<ul>
<li>Evokes the simplicity of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye and International Style</li>
<li>Symmetrical, sense of balanced proportion</li>
<li>Clean, simple, geometry</li>
<li>Vertical mullions rise without interruption (these are only decorative and part of the curtain-wall architecture)</li>
<li>Elegance of construction</li>
<li>Bronze mullions were rubbed with oil at least once a year, so they do not oxidize and become patina in color.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though we might think this was not classical because of its different color and lack of ornamentation, it <strong>invokes the classical precedent</strong>.</p>
<p>These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bronze: common in Greek sculpture</li>
<li>Pillars in front of building are fluted</li>
<li>Building is set atop a base similar to a stylobate</li>
<li>There is a sense of symmetry and proportion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technological innovations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used glass and metal, not stone and brick</li>
<li><strong>Curtain-wall architecture</strong>: outermost walls are non-structural</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Office building for Seagram Liquor company (this was their headquarters)</li>
<li>Ushered in a new era of skyscrapers (minimalist geometries without ornament/detail)</li>
<li>Testament to just how influential the Seagram Building was that it now seems commonplace</li>
<li>Created standard for modern skyscraper</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Story</strong></h5>
<p>This office building with an empty space in front was innovative and radical at the time. The open, urban plaza set the building back from Park Avenue and created a <strong>pedestrian space.</strong></p>
<p><strong>  Inside</strong>, the building is luxurious in its use of <strong>bronze, travertine</strong>, and <strong>marble</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Office spaces were furnished by Philip Johnson</strong> who was the director of architecture at MOMA.</p>
<h5><strong>Historical Notes </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Seagram,</strong> a large Canadian liquor company was the largest at that time. It flourished during prohibition because they were based in Canada, and not the United States.</p>
<p>The initial building pan was rejected by Phyllis Lambert, daughter of a Seagram owner. She was a Harvard architecture student and said the original design was the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She gave her father three choices of architects to employ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frank Lloyd Wright was rejected because at the age of 90 he was considered too old.</li>
<li>Le Corbusier was discovered to be too difficult to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</strong> was given the gig!</p>
<h5><strong>About the Architect</strong></h5>
<p>German-born architect<strong> Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</strong> was a director of a German architecture school called the Bauhaus. Nazis eventually shut down for being too modernist!</p>
<p>He came to the US in the late 1930s. His love of classical architecture and sculpture were his inspiration</p>

<p><strong>Museum</strong>: Tate London</p>
<p><strong><em>Marilyn Diptych </em></strong>by <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> is an artwork created with <strong>oil, acrylic, and silk-screen enamel on canvas</strong>. It measures <strong>6 feet 7 inches by 8 feet 8 inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>A<strong> diptych</strong>: two panels meant to be viewed together.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Enamel</strong> is an opaque shiny colored glass powder that begins as a liquid and hardens.</p>
<p><strong>Warhol </strong>developed the technique of projecting photographic images to <strong>silk screen. </strong>It enabled him to produce repetitive patterns using a stencil.</p>
<p>To create art like this, mesh cloth is stretched over a heavy wooden frame. The design is printed using a <strong>squeegee </strong>to force color through the pores of the material. The canvas sits underneath and the ink squeezes through to make the image. Any mistakes are a result of the process, rather than with the artist. Ultimately, the artist becomes a machine, removed from the process of intimate artmaking.</p>
<p>It was inspired by Abstract Expressionists in terms of scale only and announces that the subject is grandiose. The all over composition, allows the viewer’s eye to wander.</p>
<h5><strong>Why was this Work Made?</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong>Commemoration</strong> of movie star Marilyn Monroe after her death.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It takes an image that ALREADY existed and which the artist did not create.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Profitability</strong></h5>
<p>Warhol showed he could profit off a celebrity’s image. The silkscreen medium allowed for multiple works and therefore multiple profits. Additionally, he had assistants make the silkscreens for him!</p>
<h5>Ruminate on Notion of Duality</h5>
<ul>
<li>Satisfaction vs. Desensitization/Boredom</li>
<li>We want images of celebrities but after we get them, we are indifferent</li>
<li>Our lives really don’t change in any meaningful way</li>
<li>He captures our indifference to her image. Does it really matter that there are 50 instead of 1?</li>
<li>American life is depersonalized and repetitive</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Obsession and Religion</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Obsession with celebrity vs. obsession with religion. Warhol struggled with his Catholic faith.</li>
<li>Our obsession with celebrity borders on the religious. That is why he uses a diptych, commonly reserved for religious imagery.</li>
<li>Use of <strong>gold is deliberately reminiscent of Byzantine icons</strong></li>
<li>Invites us to <strong>worship</strong> Marilyn as we would Mary</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Celebrity Persona vs Death</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Contrast of vivid color with black and white and the fading in the right panel are suggestive of her mortality (Marilyn had in fact just died of suicide)</li>
<li>She is right in front of us (celebrities live on in images) but disappearing (her body does not exist anymore)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Details</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">50 images</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> (25 color, 25 black and white) of Marilyn’s publicity photograph from the 1953 film</span></p>
<p><strong>Her image: </strong>seductive, heavy-lidded eyes, parted plump lips</p>
<h5><strong>The Rest of the Story</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> argued that <strong>our obsessions and culture</strong> are exalted enough that they can be ennobled into art. This way, Pop Art shows us what matters to us.</p>
<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> died in August, 1962 of apparent suicide. Warhol’s artwork was made just a few months later.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artist</strong></p>
<p>Before becoming a leading artist in the Pop Art movement of the 1960s, American-born <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> <strong>(1928-1987)</strong> was an illustrator for both print magazines, as well as advertising.</p>
<p>He was noted for using everyday objects in his work. Examples includes the pieces like <em>Campbell’s Soup Cans</em>. As noted above, his works often include celebrities such as movie star Elizabeth Taylor, Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones, and rock legend Elvis Presley.</p>

<p><strong>Themes:</strong> Abstraction</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Museum:</strong> Philadelphia Museum of Art</p>
<p><strong><em>The Bay</em></strong> a work of <strong>acrylic on canvas</strong> by <strong>Helen Frankenthaler</strong> measures <strong>six feet eight inches by six feet and nine inches. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Color Field</strong> is a classification of painting which is achieved through “fields” of color.  The only subject is the color and it is in a non-representational form.</p>
<p><strong>Acrylic</strong> is a fast-drying paint. It is water-soluble, so it can be kept rich and thick, or loosened to have a watercolor look.</p>
<p>To <strong>soak stain</strong> the artist uses diluted acrylic paint, thinned with turpentine so it will run. Here, <strong>Frankenthaler </strong>poured paint onto the canvas. Then, the canvass was lifted and tilted at various angles so the paint would flow across the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Action painting</strong> is the physical manner of applying paint, then picking up the canvas and letting the paint drip across the surface. It is a combination of the unpredictability of gravity and the artist’s control.</p>
<h5><strong>What is our physical response to color?</strong></h5>
<p>We respond to colour in this painting in the same way we might respond to a sunset stained-glass window. These examples illustrate that colors do not have to represent something in particular, but they can instead have an ambiguous quality.</p>
<p>The goal is for the viewer to focus purely on the colors and shapes in the work.</p>
<h5><strong>Colours Chosen by the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>The painting includes different shades of blue, grey, green, and brown.</p>
<h5><strong>In Frankenthaler’s Own Words</strong></h5>
<blockquote><p>In a 1965 interview for <em>Artforum Magazine</em> <strong>Helen Frankenthaler</strong> said, “<em>When you first saw an Impressionist painting, there was a whole way of instructing the eye. Dabs of color were understood to stand in for real things. It was a guitar or a hillside. The opposite is going on now. If you have bands of blue, green, and pink, the mind doesn’t first think sky, grass, and flesh. These are colors and now the question is what are they doing with themselves and with others.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Historical Notes </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frankenthaler</strong> was one of the handful of women among the traditional all boys’ club of the <strong>Abstract Expressionists</strong></li>
<li>Clement Greenberg (art critic) believed that if art made after WWII was going to have any real impact on the world, it would have to radically change and truly move towards the abstract.</li>
<li>Post WWII despair led to an interest in abstraction (remember this same thing happens after WWI)</li>

<h5><strong><em>TOPIC 4.2  </em></strong><strong><em>Purpose and Audience in Later European </em></strong><strong><em>and American Art</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong>Works of art took on new roles and functions in society and were experienced by audiences in new ways.  Art was <strong>displayed at public exhibitions</strong>, such as the Salon in Paris, and later at commercial art galleries.</p>
<p><strong>Church patronage declined</strong> and corporate patronage emerged. The museum became an important institution of civic and national status and pride. The <strong>sale of art to the public</strong> became the leading driver of art production. The collection of art increased, driving up prices, as art became a commodity that appreciated in value. After the devastation of Europe in World War II, artists in the United States dominated the art market.</p>
<p><strong>Audiences ranged from private patrons to the public</strong>, who were sometimes hostile toward art that broke with tradition.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist in Charge</strong></h5>
<p>Artists were initially bonded by sanctioned academies and pursued inclusion in juried salons for their work to be displayed. The influence of these academies then receded in favor of radical individualism.</p>
<p>Some artists worked without patronage. Some joined together in self- defined groups. These were often on the margins of the mainstream art world. Published manifestos of their beliefs were part of artistic life. Change and innovation dominated this era and became the goals of artists.</p>
<p><strong>Women artists</strong> slowly gained recognition as many competed for admiration of their individuality and genius.</p>

<p><strong><em>Olympia</em></strong> <em>by artist</em><strong><em> Édouard Manet </em></strong><em>is an</em><strong><em> oil on canvas work. </em></strong>It measures<strong><em> 4 feet 5 by 6 feet by 4inches. </em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form: REALISM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Bold, flat brushstrokes with very little modeling</strong> comprise this work, ignoring the detailed modeling of the Renaissance and Baroque era. The paint seemed to just sit on the canvas. Many called this unskilled and childish. In fact, many parts seemed unfinished: curtain, bed sheets, breasts.</p>
<p>The Image seems stiff and flattened into two planes: foreground and background. <strong>Manet</strong> ignored shadows, modeling, and any atmosphere that would have softened her and given her a fleshy feel.</p>
<h5><strong>Function: IMPRESSIONISM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Avant-garde</strong> was new, unusual, and experimental. It was known for simplification of brushstrokes and the removal of transitional tones.</p>
<p>This work was displayed at the 1865 Salon (for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the national school of art after the Revolution disbanded the Academie Royale des peintures et sculptures).</p>
<p>Viewers weren’t sure of <strong>Manet’s </strong>motives.</p>
<p>Was he trying to produce a serious work of art?</p>
<p>Was he trying to continue the great art historical tradition of female nudes?</p>
<p>Was he honoring Titian? If you wanted to become a great painter, you had to contend with the Old Masters. Was Olympia a parody of Titian’s <em>Venus of Urbino</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Reaction was very negative</strong>. The public was so outraged by the painting that the gallery was forced to hire two policemen to protect the canvas. Objections had more to do with the realism of the subject than the fact that she was nude. She was not a Venus, not a wife, not even an odalisque (even <em>La Grande Odalisque</em> was acceptable because she was exotic and foreign!) This was a woman you could run into in the city of Paris!</p>
<p><strong>Manet was trying to capture modern life.</strong> Here he paints a woman of his time – not a feminine ideal, not a goddess, but a real prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>Art for Art’s Sake </strong>the phrase that wasn’t coined until 1875, after this painting was made is indeed still relevant.  JM Whistler, an American painter, in a court trial is credited with coming up with the phrase. He expressed the inherent value in art, even if it lacks a moral, historical, or didactic message.</p>
<h5><strong>Content: IMPRESSIONISM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>How is this Impressionism?</strong> This is a scene of modern life, not necessarily the downtrodden who are exploited and toiling on the side of the road. Granted, many of us today would say prostitutes are exploited – however, from what we see of Olympia, she is a stable, well-off woman. We must remember the context of the period.</p>
<p><em>Olympia </em>depicts a reclining nude woman, with a maid and black cat, gazing at the viewer.</p>
<h5><strong>Olympia</strong></h5>
<p>Olympia is a prostitute (a common prostitute name in Paris). The work is based on Victorine Meurent, a longtime model and lover of Manet. This is the same model in <em>Luncheon on the Grass.</em></p>
<p>Notice her jewelry, Japanese robe (the height of fashion), shoes and flower.</p>
<p>She stares <strong>challengingly at the viewer. </strong>Venus of Urbino was demure. Is Olympia bored?</p>
<p>Olympia looks uninviting. Her body is stiff. Her torso is taut. If she is a prostitute, why is she so uninviting?</p>
<h5><strong>Maid</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Offers Olympia a bouquet of flowers, presumably a gift.</li>
<li>Black women were often servants in brothels.</li>
<li>Created 15 years after slavery had been abolished in France,</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Cat</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Symbol of independence</li>
<li>Black color – symbol of nighttime</li>
<li>Associated with brothels</li>
<li>Reference to female anatomy</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Olympia</em></strong> was displayed in the Beaux-Arts Salon of 1865.  The jury accepted his work, but it still ignited scandal. It was called “inconceivable vulgarity” despite the Impressionists loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Manet</strong> is the bridge between Realism and Impressionism. This was a new beginning of artists becoming interested in modern Parisian life. There was something uniquely urban, sensational, and chic about modern Parisian life that deserved to be captured.</p>
<p>Impressionists departed from tradition by rejecting perspective, balanced compositions, chiaroscuro, and modeling. They desired sensation from color and light. There was a lack of finish to their work as well as individual technique.</p>
<h5><strong>More About Manet</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Édouard Manet (1832-1883)</strong> was a member of Paris’s upper-middle class (bourgeoisie). The artist was the only one of his contemporaries who didn’t have to sell his paintings to earn a living. Although his father wanted him to study law, <strong>Manet</strong> still preferred art. <strong>Manet</strong> loved Courbet, Velazquez, and Goya.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Everything is mere appearance, the pleasures of a passing hour, a midsummer night&#8217;s dream. Only painting, the reflection of a reflection &#8211; but the reflection, too, of eternity &#8211; can record some of the glitter of this mirage.&#8221; &#8211; Édouard Manet</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Y no hai remedio (And There’s Nothing to Be Done) </em></strong>by <strong>Francisco de Goya</strong> uses <strong>etching, drypoint, burin, and burnishing.</strong> The work measures <strong>5 feet by 6.5 feet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Uses the etching technique</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A metal plate is covered with wax.</li>
<li>(<strong>Drypoint method happens here</strong>) An image is carved (incised) into the surface of the wax using a burin, revealing the plate underneath (the printing part is cut into, while the non-printing parts are left uncut).</li>
<li>The plate is put into acid and eats away at the exposed metal parts, leaving holes.</li>
<li>The plate is heated so all wax melts off.</li>
<li><strong>(Burnishing technique happens here)</strong> Surface of sheet is covered with ink, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas.</li>
<li>Ink will be wiped away from the rest of the plate</li>
<li>Paper is applied to top to transfer image using pressure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drypoint technique is used in the second step listed above.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Incise lines directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus while applying <em>lots</em> of pressure.</li>
<li>This results in uneven, jagged lines where shavings curl up on either side and makes ridges.</li>
<li>Rather than blowing or wiping those shavings off, they are left to give extra texture to the printing.</li>
<li>Because the ridges/shavings are delicate and will be flattened through printmaking, the earliest prints in a series are more expensive and highly valued.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Burnishing technique is used in the fifth step listed above</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can see this where the smoke comes out of the gun à the burnishing makes this spot look transparent, wispy, and smoky.</li>
<li>Plate is rubbed with a burnisher to polish it, giving it a shiny or slick look once the ink is applied.</li>
<li>The plate is polished to lighten it.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>A general in the Spanish army asked Goya to record the horrors imposed on the country by Napoleon’s troops. It needed to be Pro-Spanish and Anti-French.</p>
<h5><strong>Propaganda</strong></h5>
<p>It draws attention to the abuses and injustices of Napoleon’s rule in Spain by criminalizing and protesting the French occupation. Thus, Goya made his into prints for easy distribution. Yet, it was not printed until 35 years after Goya’s death. Before this, it was dangerous to publish these political views.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Remember <strong>PINE </strong>(Past, Irrationality/Insanity, Nature, Emotion/Exotic)</p>
<p>This is part of a series called <strong><em>The Disasters of War</em></strong> that focused on Napoleonic abuses against the Spanish.</p>
<p>Original title of the series was: <em>Fatal Consequences of Spain’s Bloody War with Bonaparte and other Emphatic Caprices</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1<sup>st</sup> group showed the consequences of violence between Spain and France</li>
<li>2<sup>nd</sup> group showed the effects of a famine under French rule</li>
<li>3<sup>rd</sup> group showed the disappointment of Spanish rebels</li>

</ul>
<p>A <strong>man</strong>, <strong>blind-folded</strong>, head downcast, stands bound to a wooden pole. He wears all white, with rips and tears. He reminds us of Christ, broken but still heroic.</p>
<p>A <strong>man on the ground</strong> has been murdered. Blood and brain ooze out of his skull.</p>
<p>Other men are similarly secured to stakes in the background. We wonder if all these men are civilians. Or soldiers? It is intentionally ambiguous. Does it matter? Darkness crowds us.</p>
<p>The cause of the violence is Napoleon’s soldiers, all in a neat row on the sides. All we can see is the <strong>barrels of their guns</strong> pointed at the main figure. This cannot be stopped. His death is inevitable.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Napoleon seized control of Spain in 1807.  </strong>He did this under the guise of helping Spanish King Charles IV invade Portugal. Charles agreed. Napoleon moved all his troops into Spain. Then, he swiftly overthrew Charles IV.  Napoleon took the throne and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as ruler of Spain.</p>
<p>The result was the <strong>Peninsular Wars (1807-1814)</strong>. A bloody rebellion ensured with tremendous loss on Spanish side.</p>
<p>Goya had originally been the court artist to Charles IV. Then court artist for Joseph Bonaparte!</p>
<p>Goya could not publish this during his life, and his family waited for 35 years, until after his death to do so. They wanted to be sure that the Napoleonic influence was gone.</p>
<p>France was expelled in the Peninsular Wars.</p>
<p>This work was inspiration for Goya’s most famous image: <strong><em>Third of May.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong>About Goya</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Francisco Goya (1746-1828)</strong> was a Spanish artist known for creating paintings, drawings, and engravings. His work reflected the times in which he lived.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Oxbow (View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm) </em></strong><em>by artist</em> <strong>Thomas Cole </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 4 feet 4 inches by 6 feet 3. </strong></p>
<p>The artists during this time did not paint outdoors, but only sketched. <strong>Cole’s</strong> innovation was to lift landscape painting to the history painting level, with a large size and a grand and noble treatment. The diagonal line from top left to bottom right divides the image. We literally see an East and a West.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This was intended to be <strong>a marketable painting</strong>. There was no patron. It shows the potential and possibility of the national landscape. The landscape encapsulates the uniqueness of America. The expansion is divinely ordained (<strong>Manifest Destiny</strong>).</p>
<p>While the Western expansion positively altered the land, tension is created as wild landscape is eliminated. When does this become too much?</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>When examining PINE (Past, Irrationality/Insanity, Nature, Emotion/Exotic) we understand this work illustrates nature.  The work depicts the Connecticut River near Northampton, Massachusetts after a thunderstorm, with a recognizable bend in the river, that the locals call “The Oxbow”.</p>
<p><strong>Sublime</strong>, intense, dramatic, grand, and incomprehensible. This landscape is vast, and beyond our ability to grasp.</p>
<p>To the <strong>west/left</strong> <strong>side</strong> a huge storm is rolling away on a virginal landscape that is unruly and untamed. A blasted tree on the bottom left shows the indiscriminate power of nature.  So too does the lightening.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Cole</strong> includes his <strong>self-portrait</strong> in the lower part. He is an American making American art in the American wilderness. Artists can bridge the gap between these two worlds. Wearing a coat and hat, he stands before a stretched canvas placed on his easel.</p>
<p>To the <strong>east/right side </strong>is a peaceful, pastoral landscape. Man has made this landscape productive and civilized. What was once wild has been overtaken is becoming productive and orderly. Animals, crops, chimneys, and boats are illustrated, while the sun shines brightly.</p>
<p><strong>On the hill</strong>, logging scars are visible which form two Hebrew letters.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you read them right side up, they say “Noah”.</li>
<li>If you read them upside down, they say “Almighty”.</li>
<li>Does the beauty of the land reveal God? Is human intrusion sacrilege? Is civilization linked to God? Historians are not sure what Cole meant by these inclusions.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Landscape by the early 19<sup>th</sup> century</strong> had become synonymous with American pride.</p>
<ul>
<li>Westward expansion – westward goes the course of empire</li>
<li>Discussions of political expansion dominated western discourse</li>
<li>Louisiana Purchase had recently doubled the size of the US</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Landscapes were popular </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Captured American uniqueness/potential (<strong>Manifest Destiny</strong>)</li>
<li>Remedy for urban life/industrialization (<strong>Transcendentalism</strong> was a popular philosophy and ideology promoted the immersion into nature as healing, powerful and good.)</li>
<li>Capture life/state that is vanishing</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Thomas Cole (years) </strong>was a member of the <strong>Hudson River School</strong> (not an actual school but a group of New York city-based landscape painters).</p>
<p>Cole was <strong>British</strong> and moved to Philadelphia when he was 17. Then, he moved to Steubenville, Ohio which was literally on the edge of the American West.</p>

<p><strong><em>Slave Ship (Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On) </em></strong>by artist <strong>Joseph Mallord William Turne</strong>r is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>3 feet by 4 feet</strong> in size.</p>
<p>The painting has an emotive power of color due to the wide range being used. Look at the enormous, deep red sunset (Turner sunset) over brown sea. The sun seems to slice open the sky. The colors are fiery and rageful. (Imagine what this would look like if David painted this – far more restrained.)</p>
<p>There is a thick sensuality of paint. This later had a huge effect on modern art.</p>
<p>Clarity and scale are not important here – Turner is willing to let them go.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>In 1840, at the first World Congress meeting of the anti-slavery league (Crown Prince Albert, a well-known abolitionist, was present at this meeting). Turner’s painting was exhibited. Turner was deeply moved by this story and might have wished to impress Crown Prince Albert at this World Congress meeting.</p>
<p>The work was exhibited with lines from a poem that Turner himself had written:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay,<br />
<em>Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds<br />
<em>Declare the typhoon’s coming. Before it sweeps your decks, throw<br />
<em>Overboard the dead and dying – ne’er heed their chains<br />
<em>Hope, hope, fallacious hope! Where is thy market now?</em></em></em></em></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Transcendentalism</strong> is the awe and amazement at the brutal and indiscriminate power of nature.</p>
<p>This work is also a <strong>criticism of society</strong> and questions the viewer. Is this worth the profits?</p>
<p>The viewer sees the magnitude of man’s cruelty vs. the magnitude of nature’s power. The moral of the story is that the power of nature is greater than the power of man. Remember, this is during the Industrial Revolution when the arrogance of man (industry, science, technology) is starting to worry people.</p>

<p><strong>Drama</strong> is more important than accuracy. The artist takes liberties by adding in a storm to heighten the drama of the story. Turner was inspired by the Zong, but not documenting it.</p>
<p>There is a sailing ship on the horizon going towards the left. There are body parts, chains, fish, and sea monsters sticking up out of the water. Hands and legs sticking out of the water are dark-skinned. We see chains evident (even though they would not float with these on).</p>
<p>Sea gulls are encircling. Sails of the ship are not unfurled as sea spray flies everywhere.  The storm is coming in.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>allegory of the fight of humankind with the elements</strong>. Is this a biblical metaphor? Christians often utilized a ship in a storm as a metaphor.</p>
<h5><strong>The Story of The Zong </strong></h5>
<p>The Zong was a British slave ship that sailed for Jamaica in <strong>1783</strong>. It was the captain’s last journey and he wanted to collect a great profit for retirement. He sailed with 470 slaves and 17 crew. Many had begun to die from sickness in the Doldrums of the Atlantic (an area where the winds are so calm, there are hardly any winds at all). Seven of the 17 crew died, along with 50 of the slaves.</p>
<p>The slaves got sicker and sicker, and water was running out. The only way to collect insurance on dead slaves and not take a loss is to claim accidental drowning (not sickness). This was intended to encourage captains to treat slaves humanely, by not letting them starve, or not having enough water.</p>
<p>The ship captain doubts the likelihood of them all making it&#8211;not just alive, but healthy enough that he could sell them for a profit. So, he decided to throw them overboard and collect insurance. This way he could collect 30 pounds per slave.</p>
<p>He threw 132 slaves overboard.  Most were women and children. Some did not sink and struggled, trying to climb back up on the boat. The crew then attached cannonballs to them and then threw them over.</p>
<p>This left 288 slaves on the boat. These were sold to slave traders in Jamaica for 36 pounds each.</p>
<p>Once in Jamaica, the ship’s owner filed for insurance. The captain said his actions of throwing slaves overboard was the humane thing to do and necessary because of his concerns over lack of water.</p>
<p>The insurance company refused, so the ship owner and captain went to court to make the insurance company pay. The court case was not about the morality of throwing these slaves overboard.</p>
<p>The court ruled in favor of the owner/captain making the insurers pay 30 pounds per slave.</p>
<p>Judge said: “<em>What is this claim that human people have been thrown overboard? This is a case of goods. Blacks are goods and property – it is madness to accuse these well-serving men of murder. They acted out of necessity and in the most appropriate manner. The late Captain Collingwood acted in the interest of his ship to protect the safety of his crew. The case is the same as if wood had been thrown overboard</em>.”</p>
<p>The case was brought to attention of abolitionists who decried the injustice.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Auguste Rodin </strong>is a <strong>sculpture-in-the-round </strong>comprised of<strong> bronze. </strong>It was made using the<strong> lost-wax technique</strong>.</p>
<p>Figures are arranged into a dynamic circle. No one figure is the focal point. This allows the sculpture to be viewed in-the-round from multiple perspectives, without a clear leader. There is no contrast or emphasis.</p>
<p>The men are fragile vs. the heavy, rhythmic drapery that anchors them. This makes them broader. There is a roughness and stylization to the figures. Their bodies appear in agony, both twisted and contorted. This is not a heroic monument, unlike <em>George Washington</em> and <em>Augustus Prima Porta.</em></p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>In 1885, <strong>Rodin </strong>was commissioned by the French city of Calais to create a sculpture that commemorated the heroism of Eustache Saint-Pierre.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saint-Pierre was a prominent citizen of Calais during the 100 Years War between England and France (began in 1337)</li>
<li>The statue would be timely as Calais being besieged by the English in the 100 Years War was similar to France being besieged by Prussia (Germany) in the Franco-Prussian War, which ended in 1871.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The patrons wanted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A heroic statue of Eustache (It was Common to depict heroic men as sole figures like George Washington.)</li>
<li>Raised pedestal</li>
<li>Heroism was key to show Eustache in a heroic light</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Rodin wanted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All six men</li>
<li>An emotional work to enhance a personal connection with the viewer and bring the audience in.</li>
<li>He wanted it to be street-level so the audience could feel a part of the tragedy.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>The Resolution</strong></h5>
<p>This tug-of-war persisted between Rodin and the committee for ten years. The correspondence reveals that the Calais mayor tried to keep Rodin’s interest in the project despite their disagreements and delays.</p>
<p>The <strong>patrons were so disappointed</strong>, they did not want to purchase it. They wanted one statue of Eustache since he was the council leader of the burghers. And where was the pedestal?</p>
<p>They did not like that the men were unidealized and emotional. They thought this display of male emotion was inappropriate, and made them look vulnerable and weak, instead of ennobled.</p>
<p><strong>Rodin gave them a version with a pedestal</strong> to satisfy them. Then, <strong>he made a second version without a pedestal for himself. </strong></p>
<p>The patrons were still so disappointed, they did not order additional castings like they had discussed.</p>
<h5><strong>One Moment in Time</strong></h5>
<p>Look at the choice in <strong>the moment of the narrative</strong> (have not discussed this since Baroque art!)</p>
<p><strong>Rodin</strong> does not show these men when they were released. Instead, he shows them in the moment they gather to go to their deaths. We see them in agony. Instead of elating the men in the moment of full knowledge that they will not die, he shows us that the threat of death is very real.</p>
<h5><strong>The Men</strong></h5>
<p>Six men appear – these are the <strong>burghers</strong> (councilmen) of Calais. They are wearing only simple tattered sackcloth (<strong>King Edward humiliated them by making them wear sackcloth</strong> to reinforce his power over them). The clothing anchors them to the ground. There is no escaping their fate.</p>
<p>They appear <strong>thin and malnourished</strong>. The city had been besieged for 11 months. The man with the beard is <strong>Eustache de Saint-Pierre.</strong></p>
<p>The men stand together, but they do not make eye contact or interact with one another. Each is reflecting on their own choice and their own sense of loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some have their heads bowed.</li>
<li>Some raise their hands.</li>
<li>Others gaze out into the distance (one with key to the city: Jean d’Aire).</li>
<li>Some plea.</li>
<li>They are united then not through contact but by their posture and circumstance.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Warring and Death</strong></h5>
<p>Calais was besieged for 11 months with dwindling food and water. To end the assault on the French, English King Edward III made a deal with the city of Calais. If they wished to save their lives and the city, they must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surrender the key to the city to the king.</li>
<li>Six burghers must die!</li>
</ul>
<p>The burghers had to decide what to do. Unbeknownst to the burghers, their lives would be spared. The king’s wife Philippa persuaded him to not kill the burghers. She believed the deaths would be a bad omen for their unborn child</p>
<h5><strong>More About Rodin and</strong> <strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rodin</strong> was denied entry into the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris three times. He <strong>needed recognition and approval,</strong> so he took this job despite not being interested in it. The committee selected him because he was cheaper than a Beaux-Arts artist!</p>
<p>He revolutionized the sculpture and disregarded the traditions of heroic sculpture. <strong>Rodin</strong> used a version recounting the 100 Years War by a 14<sup>th</sup> century French chronicler named Jean Froissart.</p>
<h5><strong>Artist Backgrounder</strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Auguste Rodin (1840-1917)</strong> was born in Paris, France. He started out in the field of decorative arts and did not become a sculptor until his 40s.  His most famous works include, <strong><em>The Age of Bronze</em></strong><strong>, </strong><strong><em>The Thinker, The Kiss</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>

Funerary</p>
<p><strong><em>Memorial Sheet for Karl Liebknecht </em></strong>is a<strong> woodcut </strong>work by artist<strong> Käthe Kollwitz, </strong>which measures<strong> 1 foot 2 inches by 1 foot 9 inches.  </strong></p>
<p>The artist first experimented with her creations. She tried first to make etchings, then lithographs. Then ultimately, she settled on woodcuts for which she is best known for. <strong>Kollwitz </strong>believed woodcuts captured the rough, vital energy needed for depicting horrors of war. Figures are made sharp and stark.</p>
<p>The composition is divided into <strong>three sections. </strong>The densely packed <strong>top level</strong> has well modeled faces. In the <strong>middle level</strong> one figure breaks between the barriers. The <strong>lowest level</strong> is contrasted with white and blackened faces. It is an inverted color scheme from the one she establishes up above. The contrast and emphasis lets us see Liebknecht’s face.</p>
<h5><strong>German Expressionism </strong></h5>
<p><strong>German Expressionism</strong> has two main characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jagged, rough lines</li>
<li>Vivid, expressive colors</li>
</ul>
<p>While this work does not utilize color, it certainly has the rough, expressive, and splintered use of line.</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>propaganda</strong> to ennoble, aggrandize, honor, and memorialize Liebknecht. <strong>Prints</strong> were able to produce multiple copies of the same image. This was cheap and easy to distribute. It was the ideal medium for spreading political statements.</p>
<p>After the death of Karl Liebknecht, his family asked <strong>Kollwitz</strong> to make a work to <strong>memorialize him</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>She had 2 sons join the army in WWI; one died; her work stagnated; she had lost passion</li>
<li>She had seen Liebknecht speak and admired his charisma, even though she was not a communist.</li>
<li>However, communists criticized her because she was not a communist herself.</li>
</ul>
<p>She defended herself, “As an artist, I have the right to extract emotional content out of anything.”</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Made in the style of the Lamentation, with Liebknecht as the Christ-like figure/martyr
<ul>
<li>Followers of Christ/Liebknecht mourning over their dead bodies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus is on common people – workers – affected by tragedy
<ul>
<li>Dignity, variety of working class</li>
<li>Mother and child (future generations affected)</li>
<li>Mourner’s hand connects to the chest of the martyred revolutionary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Text says: From living to dead memory; indicates he will live on as Christ did</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About Liebknecht </strong></h5>
<p>In 1912, Liebknecht became a communist and was elected to the Reichstag (German Parliament). He was very opposed to WWI.</p>
<p>Liebknecht formed the Berlin Spartacus League which printed an illegal newspaper called the Spartacus Letters (from the name Spartacus after the slave who led a failed revolt against the Roman Army in 73 BCE). Spartacus League essentially became the German Communist party.</p>
<p>In 1916 the Spartacists called for an end to the war. Liebknecht was arrested and spent the rest of the war in prison. In 1918 he was released when amnesty was granted to all political prisoners.</p>
<p>In 1919 a German Revolution (aka Spartacus Revolt) was attempted. It was the Spartacus League vs. the government of Friedrich Elbert. The revolt was defeated with ease by Elbert’s Germany army.   Liebknecht was murdered, after being held in a hotel room, before being transported to prison.</p>
<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kollwitz </strong>was the first woman accepted into the Prussian Academy of Arts (she received a studio, an income, and a professorship).</li>
<li>In political turmoil after WWI, many artists turn to prints as an ideal medium for spreading political statements.</li>
<li>German Expressionism grew as a reaction to WWI: exhibiting the disjointed, broken, jagged society that remained.</li>

Man v. nature</p>
<p><strong>Villa Savoye</strong> created by architect <strong>Le Corbusier</strong> is a <strong>steel and concrete</strong> construction that stands in <strong>Poissy-sur-Seine, France. </strong></p>
<p><strong>International Style</strong> was named that because its rational approach to design could be used universally. It was devised through the <strong>Five Points of Architecture,</strong> a universal system of architecture.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pilotis</strong>: slender columns (derived from classicism) to raise the building off the ground.</li>
<li>Two Roof terraces: bring nature into an urban setting.</li>
<li>Free and open floor plan.</li>
<li>Façade that is simple, smooth, unadorned, lacking ornamentation, white</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ribbon windows</strong>: let in light but reinforce simplicity, a streamlined look, and a view of nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delicate floating box</li>
<li>Completely devoid of historical ornamentation</li>
<li>Ribbon windows seem industrial, productive</li>
<li>Painted white to evoke simplicity and the classics, while creating a smooth quality.

<li>Non-traditional transitions between floors with spiraling staircases and ramps.</li>
<li>In contrast to hallways, corners, edges that we are used to that demarcate space.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>The patrons were Pierre and Emilie Savoye. They believed in the benefits of fresh air and sunshine and considered outdoor time to be the mark of modern leisure. They wanted a home that <strong>integrated outdoor and indoor spaces. </strong></p>
<p>The home was <strong>designed to maximize pleasure and efficiency,</strong> while stripping away excess. This required minimal distractions and an integration of exterior and interior.</p>
<p>The home is in the Paris suburb <strong>to escape from crowded Paris.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is a functional house with a roof garden with plants and sculpture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top</strong>: garden with decoration inspired by grain silos / steam liners</li>
<li><strong>Middle</strong>: rooms</li>
<li><strong>Bottom:</strong> garage</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Le Corbusier</strong> wanted to capture the essence of modern architecture. Therefore, he needed to use modern technologies. The architect looked to cars, ocean liners, factories, even grain silos to do so.</p>
<p>In 1929, he a wrote book entitled <strong><em>Toward an Architecture</em>. </strong>In it he argued that classical architecture when combined with ideas pulled from <strong>cars, airplanes and trains</strong> could be used to make modern homes. He said science, technology, rationalism, efficiency, leisure, cleanliness, and order helped to maximize leisure. Therefore, this should be the most important thing.</p>
<p>The Greeks created ideal and streamlined forms, beautiful in their simplicity. Think the Parthenon.</p>
<p>Modern cars, airplanes and trains are also simple, beautiful, and efficient. They are streamlined, orderly, clean, and harmonious in their design. Therefore, a modern home, based on the objects of modernity should have all these same influences and qualities.</p>
<blockquote><p>Le Corbusier wrote, “A house is a machine for living in.” This was a radical new idea of the domestic home.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure) </em></strong><em>by </em><strong>Meret Oppenheim is a fur-covered cup, saucer, and spoon</strong>. It is Chinese gazelle fur. The saucer measures<strong> 9 inches in diameter.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Form</strong><strong>                                                                                                                        </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sculpted objects and assemblages</strong> had become prominent features of <strong>Surrealist art practice.</strong></li>
<li>Surrealists took Duchamp’s Fountain (absurd sculpture) and gave it a multiplicity of meanings</li>
<li>How might an otherwise typical, functional <strong>found object</strong> be modified so it represents something deeply personal or symbolic? à Appropriation.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Surrealism’s</strong> love of alchemy is revealed by turning something cool, smooth, ceramic, and metal into something warm, furry, and bristly.</p>
<p>This work has <strong>taken something utilitarian and turned it into a sculptural work</strong>. In a way, this is like a readymade!</p>
<p><strong>Oppenheim stresses the physicality of the object</strong>, like Brancusi’s <em>Kiss.</em> It retains its original starting shape.</p>
<p>Imagine the feeling of the fur while drinking from the cup and using the saucer and spoon. How is this different than viewing a Renaissance or other work? The point is the viewer experiences the work. They think through what it would be like.</p>
<p>The form of this work is familiar to us, but the experience is not. Fur imbues these functional, hand-held objects with sexual connotations. Transformed genteel items traditional associated with female decorum into sensuous, sexually punning tableware. A small concave object covered in fur, that you put warm liquid into and is meant to be in your mouth…</p>
<h5><strong>A Note</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Oppenheim </strong>herself said her work was not meant to have a sexual interpretation. She was very frustrated by this. She believed this interpretation was only because she was female, and she stopped producing art for a number of years.</p>
<h5><strong>The Hallmark of Symbolism</strong></h5>
<p>However, Surrealist interpretations vary and morph. This is believed to be a fair evaluation and the “way it worked”. It was thought that when a Surrealist artist makes their artwork and then displays it, the public has the right to make interpretations of it. This is a hallmark of Symbolism.</p>
<h5><strong>The Original Title</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Oppenheim’s</strong> title was <strong><em>Object,</em></strong> but another Surrealist took the liberty of adding to the title: <strong><em>Le Dejeneur en fourrure</em> (Luncheon in Fur)</strong> a sexual connotation for oral sex.</p>
<p>This is a play on Manet’s infamous Impressionist painting <strong><em>Luncheon on the Grass</em></strong> and a famous erotic novel <strong><em>Venus in Furs.</em></strong></p>
<h5><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>A 22-year-old <strong>Meret Oppenheim</strong> was with Pablo Picasso and his mistress Dora Maar in a café. Oppenheim was wearing a brass bracelet covered in fur. Picasso, admiring it, proclaimed “Anything can be covered in fur!” Oppenheim replied, “Even this cup and saucer!”</p>
<p>Another version is that she commented her tea needed a fur coat to keep it warm.</p>
<p>When she finished <strong><em>Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure),</em></strong> she submitted it for an exhibition of Surrealist artworks, in Paris. Many declared it a quintessential Surrealist object.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Park </em></strong>by Mexican born artist <strong>Diego Rivera </strong>is a<strong> fresco </strong>measuring<strong> 15 feet and 8 inches by 49 feet. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Congested picture plane with overlapping organic and geometric shapes, curving lines, bright colors</li>
<li>Interior is lightest, edges are darkest</li>
<li>Landscape depicts three separate groups</li>
<li>Figures are stacked up for better viewing</li>
<li><strong>Fresco</strong>: tempera on wet plaster</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is a <strong>dream-like</strong> depiction of the <strong>true history of the people of Mexico</strong>. The artist believed history is written by the victors, and thus depicts an incomplete story. <strong>Rivera</strong> depicts stories typically written out of history. He deliberately includes <strong>people of all classes</strong>.</p>
<p>This work is painted in the Versailles restaurant of the Hotel Prado, a government hotel next to Alameda Park.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is supposed to capture a dream-like fantasy of Mexican history. Since dreams are so strange, <strong>Rivera</strong> can juxtapose a variety of subject matter together.</p>
<p><strong>Left (Spanish Conquest):</strong> Conquest and religious intolerance led to democratic nation</p>
<ul>
<li>Inquisitors</li>
<li>Cortez in white ruff and bloody hands</li>
<li>Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz</li>
<li>Benito Juarez who restored the republic after French occupation in the Second Mexican Empire</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Center (Fight for independence and revolution): Bourgeois men and women in park</strong></p>
<p>This is in Alameda Park originally an Aztec marketplace and a place to burn heretics during the Spanish Inquisition. This was transformed into a private park for Spanish creole society. After the Mexican independence it became open to the public as a popular destination.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera</strong>, shown as a child, holds hands with <strong>La Catrina</strong>. She represents the Aztec goddess Coatlicue whose <strong>symbol is that of a skull</strong>. Grinning skeletons are common in Mexican culture and were part of Aztec art before the Spanish conquest. Now she is in European clothing, also inspired by traditions of memento moris/vanitas.</p>
<p><strong>Frida</strong> has her hand on his shoulder, <strong>nurturing him</strong>.  She holds a <strong>yin/yang symbol</strong> which represents the duality and the complexity of their relationship.</p>
<p>A gigantic balloon says RM, <strong>symbolizing hopes for the Republic of Mexico</strong>.</p>
<p>Others in the scene in the center include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posada (the printmaker who designs the modern La Catrina)</li>
<li>Porfirio Diaz (dictator who did not modernize Mexico and inadvertently caused the Mexican Revolution).</li>
<li>An Indigenous woman clashes with police indicating not everything is better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On the Right (Modern achievements?) is the future any better?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Francisco Madero (overthrew Diaz and was assassinated in 1913), working class</li>
<li>Indigenous family vs. police</li>
<li>A man shooting someone in a face showing violence still pervades</li>
<li>People trampled by horses</li>
<li>There originally was a sign held by figures that said “God does not exist”</li>
<li>Statement was made in 1836 by a speaker and <strong>Rivera</strong> was an atheist <strong> </strong></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Workers’ flags</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rivera</strong> often painted frescos that <strong>celebrated the indigenous history of Mexico and socialism. </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>original work had a sign</strong> painted into it that said, <strong>“God does not exist”.</strong> In a deeply Catholic country, the accusation that God did not exist caused an uproar. Also, this was not what people expected to find in an upscale government hotel. <strong>Viewers protested the sign</strong>. The Mexican archbishop would not bless the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>The painting was attacked.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Rivera</strong> refused to change it, so it was hidden, until 1956.  Then Rivera agreed to alter it.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> San Francisco MOMA and Tate London have copies</p>
<p><strong><em>Fountain (second version) </em></strong>by<strong> Marcel Duchamp </strong>is a<strong> readymade glazed sanitary china with black paint. </strong>The work stands<strong> 15 inches tall.</strong></p>
<h5><em> </em><strong>Form </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Sculpture in the round</li>
<li>Toilet was a <strong>found object</strong>: artist appropriates it, choice to do this makes it art.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is known as a <strong>readymade</strong>, a commonplace object selected and exhibited as a work of art. The artist has had to do little as the work was made ready.</p>
<p>The ONE THING that had united ALL other works is that an artist’s hand made it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Duchamp said, “Why is art more about craft than vision?”</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Function</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Here, art is a transformation of ordinary materials into something that makes us see things in a new way</p>
<p><strong>Duchamp</strong> said this is what happens with pigments, roots, and oil. It is mixed up as paint and depicts an image. He questioned why was what he was doing so terribly wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Duchamp</strong> rejected the assumption that art must be linked to the craft of the hand. Instead, he said art should be about an idea.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s art because I said so,” said Marcel Duchamp. By saying this he illustrated the power of the artist to create a new thought and new purpose to an object.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is art, after all? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Does it have to be made by the hand of the artist? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can the artist just have an idea and put that idea into action?</strong></p>
<p>This work designates a lowly object as a work of art. It makes the viewer ask, what can be considered art? He INTENDED for this to be absurd, to demonstrate the societal constructions about art.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’ve done everything as other artists did it, yet people will say this isn’t art.” Marcel Duchamp.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>What Do We See? </strong></h5>
<p>He turned the urinal on its side and placed it on a pedestal (wooden block). This undermined its utilitarian associations and uses sculptural traditions of aggrandizement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pun: fountain spots liquid, a urinal is meant to collect it.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>We certainly wouldn’t want to drink from this…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He signed it R. Mutt 1917, and named it a Fountain (a nonsense name based on Mott Ironworks where he bought the urinal)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Dada </strong>was an art movement in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. It arose as a reaction to WWI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Artwork/poetry/performances are often nonsensical and absurd</li>
<li>Intentional mockery of society and conventions</li>
</ul>
<p>After moving from Paris to NYC in 1915, <strong>Duchamp </strong>became a founding member of the <strong>American Society of Independent Artists (ASIA)</strong>, a group dedicated to advancing new art forms. He was the director.</p>
<p>The group <strong>tackled the problem of juried art shows</strong>.  Juries always selected traditional works. Artists had to be selected to show art, ASIA wanted to promote new possibilities.</p>
<p>The 1917 Show was advertised as “No Jury – No Prizes. They planned to accept all works. The entrance fee was $80.  This was to <strong>encourage nontraditional works</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Duchamp</strong> submitted this urinal as sculpture and paid the $80 fee. It inspired a heated debate amongst the board and was rejected an hour before the opening. Remember <strong>Duchamp</strong> was the director! He resigned immediately in protest.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>French American artist <strong>Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968)</strong> produced paintings, sculpture, and short films. He was associated not only with Dadaism, but Cubism and Surrealism.</p>

<p><strong><em>Woman I </em></strong>by artist<strong> Willem De Kooning </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 6 feet and 4 inches by 6 feet and 4 inches.  </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Took a year and a half to complete (numerous preliminary studies)</li>
<li>Large canvas in reference to history paintings. This is clearly not in content, but he argues this is significant.</li>
<li>He often applied paint to the canvas and scraped it away.</li>
<li>He even discarded this canvas in the trash for a few weeks, then dug it back out.</li>
<li>Handling of paint is thick, rough, and opaque.</li>
<li>Prepared massive quantities of paint in kitchen bowls and constantly tweaked them by adding water or eggs or pigment.</li>
<li><strong>Action painting</strong>: physical, vigorous application of paint, involves the body.</li>
<li>Body is outlined in thick black lines.</li>
<li>Abrupt, angular strokes or <strong>orange, blue, green, yellow, and pink.</strong></li>
<li>Rejects idealization of female body</li>
<li>She is hefty but also flattened</li>
<li>Highly abstracted figure, aggressive brushwork, and intense color palette</li>
<li>Wanted huge canvases to speak to universal truth; take the history painting à make it full abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Critics had declared the figure obsolete in painting.  Instead of abandoning the subject, <strong>de Kooning</strong> readdressed this subject in a series of six paintings. This is the first.</p>
<ul>
<li> “Female painted through the ages” – timelessness</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Repeats tradition in showing us a female nude!</li>
<li>Aggressive, hulking, menacing, vengeful, wild-eyed figure of a sexualized woman
<ul>
<li>Reverses traditional female representations: gigantic eyes, massive breasts, toothy grin</li>
<li>Some accused him of misogyny, but a friend said “I don’t know if he hates women or if he likes them too much…”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An amalgam of female archetypes, from Paleolithic fertility goddesses to 1950s pinup girls (smile influenced by ad of women selling Camel cigarettes)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About Abstract Expressionism </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Abstract Expressionism </strong>started in NYC in late 40s and early 50s. It focused on total <strong>abstraction with no reference to representation</strong>, but applied paint to the canvas in a rough, physical manner a la Expressionism.</p>
<p>The theory was this nonrepresentational manner of painting would allow the artist to draw out greater truths and inner ideas. The image was <strong>not preconceived</strong>. It was the result of the creative process and the artist’s impulse.</p>
<p>This was the reaction to WWII and American regionalism. There was a feeling of despair.</p>
<h5><strong>Willem De Kooning</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Willem de Kooning (1904-1997) </strong>was born in the Netherlands. In 1926, he arrived in America, penniless and unable to speak English. He joined AbEx painters but differed in that he applies the Expressionist technique to figures.</p>
<p>The female figure was the subject he was most interested in and has caused much debate,</p>
<p>“I never was interested in how to make a good painting…,” he once said. “I didn’t work on it with the idea of perfection, but to see how far one could go…” Willem de Kooning</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Museum:</strong> Yale University</p>
<p><strong><em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks </em></strong>by <strong>Claes Oldenburg</strong> is made from<strong> Cor-Ten steel, steel, aluminium, and cast resin. </strong>It is<strong> painted with polyurethane enamel </strong>and stands<strong> 24 feet tall. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The original version</strong> was made of inexpensive materials including plywood tracks. It was not initially intended to be permanent and was damaged buy both deterioration and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>The new construction</strong> began with stronger materials. <strong>Cor-Ten steel</strong> rusts and eliminates the need for paint as the rust becomes the color.</p>
<h5><strong>Why this Art was Made </strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks </em></strong>was originally commissioned by students from the Yale School of Architecture to disrupt a public space, create a political statement, and to be used as a platform for public speakers, while making anti-war speeches.</p>
<p>It was placed in <strong>Beinecke Plaza on the Yale Campus</strong> and overlooked the office of Yale’s president and a WWI memorial on campus. The red lipstick was originally meant to be deflated when the platform was not in use and inflated to get students’ attention.</p>
<p>The work was a satirical comment on the Vietnam War with hawkish, hyper-masculine rhetoric of the military verses a feminine tube of lipstick. It was <strong>a comment on masculinity and femininity</strong> with the traditional masculinity of war (hard, gritty, violent) verses traditional femininity of lipstick (sensual, soft, alluring).</p>
<p>The inclusion of lipstick in this work also took on an additional meaning in <strong>commemoration of Yale becoming a coeducational university</strong>. It allowed female students into the undergrad programs for the first time <strong>in 1969</strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>Lipstick tube on tank</p>
<ul>
<li>Meant to look like a gun turret</li>
<li>Phallic and bullet-like, making the beauty product seem out of place, violent and comical</li>
<li>Male and female themes unite (feminine lipstick vs traditional masculinity of war)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Historical Backgrounder</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pop Art</strong> was a growing trend in <strong>American artwork</strong> in the 1950s and 1960s. It <strong>elevated the everyday</strong> and made these subjects appropriate for fine art.</p>
<p><strong>The Vietnam War</strong> was escalating at the time the work was created. There were many protests on college campuses against the war. Yale was one of those places.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>About the Artist </strong></h5>
<p>Swedish-born conceptual/pop artist <strong>Claes Oldenburg </strong>was born in 1929. He began proposing large-scale sculptures of everyday objects as a tribute to American consumer culture.  He is known for his ingenious, oversized renditions of ordinary objects elevated to a grand size (art historical tradition tells us if the artwork is large, it must be significant).</p>

<h5>TOPIC 4.1 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Later European and American Art</h5>
<p>From the mid-1700s to 1980 CE, Europe and the Americas experienced rapid change and innovation. Art existed in the context of dramatic events.</p>
<p>This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrialization</li>
<li>Urbanization</li>
<li>Economic upheaval</li>
<li>Migration</li>
<li>War</li>
<li>The formation of countries and governments</li>
<li>Women’s and civil rights’ movements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The Enlightenment</strong> was a European intellectual movement. It was based on the celebration of reason. This helped to understand the universe. Revolutionary developments in the arts, philosophy and politics occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific inquiry</strong> and empirical evidence were promoted to reveal and understand the physical world. Belief in knowledge and progress led to revolutions and a new emphasis on human rights.</p>
<p><strong>Romanticism</strong> focused on emotion and individualism, while reviving medievalism. It offered a critique of</p>
<p>Enlightenment principles and <strong>industrialization.</strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>A Proliferation of Art</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Artists </strong>assumed new roles in society. Styles of art proliferated and often gave rise to artistic movements.</p>
<p><strong>Art and architecture</strong> exhibited a diversity of styles, forming an array of “isms.” Diverse artists with a common dedication to innovation came to be discussed as the avant-garde.</p>
<p><strong>Subdivisions include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Neoclassicism</li>
<li>Romanticism</li>
<li>Realism</li>
<li>Impressionism</li>
<li>Post-impressionism</li>
<li>Symbolism</li>
<li>Expressionism</li>
<li>Cubism</li>
<li>Constructivism</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Surrealism</li>
<li>Abstract expressionism</li>
<li>Pop art</li>
<li>Performance art</li>
<li>Earth and environmental art</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these categories fall under the general heading of Modernism.</p>
<h5><strong>The Influence of Philosophy on Art Making</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>philosophies</strong> of Marx and Darwin affected worldviews, followed by the works of Freud and Einstein.  Later, postmodern theory influenced art making and the study of art.</p>
<h5><strong>An Architectural Revival</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Architecture </strong>witnessed a series of revival styles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classical</li>
<li>Gothic</li>
<li>Renaissance</li>
<li>Baroque</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Louvre</p>
<p><strong><em>La Grande Odalisque</em></strong> painted by <strong>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres</strong>, is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>2 feet 9 inches by 5 feet 5 inches.</strong> It encompasses elements of both Neoclassical/ Romanticism.</p>
<h5><strong>Neoclassical Elements</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>La Grande Odalisque</em></strong>  shows a glossy, enamel-like crispness, with a <strong>licked finish</strong> and no visible brushwork. This is an influence from David. It is as if someone has sucked all the air out of the image and it is full of precision.</p>
<p>The woman is arranged <strong>parallel to the picture plane</strong>. She is well-lit and pushed forward. There is Interest in the line. We can follow the line made by the curve of her back.</p>
<p><strong>Idealization and stylization</strong> are part of the work. She was painted “ideal” and sexual in Ingres’ mind, but this has required an unnatural elongation and stylization of her back. He claimed while painting that “he couldn’t stop himself” with her back. In fact, one may argue there are extra vertebrae in her back.  He believed a woman’s back was the most sensual part of the body. Additionally, placed her left leg in an impossible position, all to achieve a languidness and sense of curvature.  This reminds us of Mannerist elongation. Mannerism was Ingres’ favorite style.</p>
<p><strong>Compositionally</strong>, she is very large and touches nearly all four edges. This is a voluptuous and sensuous expression of the body. It was idealized to be erotic.</p>
<p><strong>Color Evoking Emotion</strong></p>
<p>She is icy, aloof, and has a distant look in her eye.  Use of blues makes the image cool with an association with the Middle East (lapis lazuli). Only warm spots are on her back and fan.</p>
<h5><strong>A Romantic Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was commissioned by Caroline Murat, Napoleon’s sister, and Queen of Naples. She was interested in the Middle East, due to Naples’ trade connections with that area. The painting was an experiment with new Romantic ideas using exoticism and eroticism.</p>
<p>It examines a reclining female nude in a new context that is no longer mythological, but real and exotic. The work also celebrates French imperialism, while objectifying the fetishize of the Orient. The French had a sexual and cultural fascination with this region.</p>
<h5><strong>The Scandal</strong></h5>
<p>This work was shown in the Salon of 1819, and it caused a scandal. Viewers were surprised by the frank gaze and sensuality of the nude. This exotic context was new and shocking. There was no way to connect this woman to Venus. Also, the elongation of the body struck viewers as odd.</p>
<h5><strong>Content: Romantic</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>Romantic content has <strong>P.I.N.E</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong> is for <strong>Past </strong></li>
<li><strong>I </strong>is for <strong>Irrationality/Insanity</strong></li>
<li><strong>N</strong> is for <strong>Nature</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> is for <strong>Erotic/Exotic</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Life in a Harem </strong></h5>
<p>This work depicts an odalisque. This is a woman in a harem, as a concubine, companion, and source of entertainment. Ingres had never been in a harem. This was a western/French fantasy of what a harem would be.</p>
<p>Historically, this is completely inaccurate. The woman in the portrait is a white-washed version of an Oriental woman.</p>
<h5><strong>The Reclining Female Nude</strong></h5>
<p>This work plays into the tradition of the reclining female nude&#8212;going back to Titian. The previous nudes were all said to be Venus, or they could at least be interpreted as Venus.</p>
<p>With Ingres’ <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,</em></strong> there is no way to interpret her as a Venus – she is a harem girl. This is <strong>not in a classical setting</strong>. This is exotic and <strong>Oriental</strong> which at time was commonly used to refer to <strong>Near East and North Africa</strong>, not the Far East. Look at the peacock fan, turban, enormous pearls and hookah, a pipe for opium.</p>
<p>Her body is shocking to the viewer. This is not Venus but a girl whose occupation is sex. She isn’t an ideal, imaginary goddess, but she is a real woman! She gazes directly at us. Her body is bizarrely elongated, seemingly rejecting all classical idealization.</p>
<p>Her body is made acceptable to French culture for two reasons. Ingres turns her over and away from the viewer. She is not as pornographic as she could have been. Also, she is geographically distant not a European woman. This is what makes her exotic instead of scandalous.</p>
<h5><strong>Orientalism</strong></h5>
<p>Orientalism was an interest in the Orient (Middle East and Asia) because of colonialism. France was a huge colonial power. The interest in non-western cultures was growing. This fascination with other cultures was paired with the belief that the French were civilized and superior.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>About Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1864) </strong> was a student of David. He absorbed his teacher’s Neoclassical vision but reinterpreted it. Ingres won the Prix de Rome and lived in Italy from 1806 – 24. In 1814, he traveled to Naples where he was employed by Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, and Napoleon’s sister. Naples, because of its proximity to the Middle East and its connections with trade, was interested in Orientalism and exoticism.</p>
<p>The artist returned to serve as the French Academy’s director, in Rome, from 1835 – 1841</p>
<p>When Ingres painted <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,</em></strong> he had started to reject neoclassical subject matter as too stuffy, dull, and arrogant in its moral instruction.</p>

<p><strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery </em></strong>by artist <strong>Joseph Wright of Derby</strong>, is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> large work measuring <strong>4 feet 10 inches by six feet eight inches</strong>. We would expect to see a history painting in this size, but here the artist is trying to aggrandize the sitters.</p>
<p><strong>Tenebrism</strong> is used for dramatic effect, although it is not religious in content. There is dramatic lighting and scale in a closely packed space, with a strong internal light source</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong> are painted with extreme <strong>realism</strong>. (He was criticized for painting people too realistically!) The figures are pushed forward on a picture plane and tightly packed. The philosopher in the middle is obvious, in the center, with the brightest lighting and wearing deep red. Often, <strong>conversation portraits</strong> (images of people sitting around together) were popular and were formally arranged. Wright of Derby was famous for his natural and informal arrangements.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work <strong>promotes a belief in science</strong>. It is an empirical observation grounded in science and reason that could best advance society. This is still about conversion (light symbolizes conversion) and transformation, but rather unlike <em>Calling of St. Matthew</em> where the conversion is to religion, we are witnessing a conversion to science.</p>
<p>This makes the argument that art and science go together. Artwork shows the power of science. Rachel Ruysch’s work did the same.</p>
<p>The artist took a history painting (large, noble, aggrandizing method) and applied it to a composition with a contemporary secular subject.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong><em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery</em></strong><em>, </em>depicts the moment of epiphany or transformation. Here people are witnessing the truth of science. The message is that science is for everyone – look at the wide variety of people who witness this event.</p>
<p>Notice all the figures are seated in a circle around the orrery which emits a central light source.</p>
<ul>
<li>All faces represent different phases of the moon – clever reference to the Lunar Society.</li>
<li>Two young boys gaze over the edge.</li>
<li>A teenage girl rests on the machine, concentrating.</li>
<li>A young man shields his eyes.</li>
<li>A woman stares intently.</li>
<li>A standing man takes notes.</li>
<li>The philosopher stands over the orrery (likely based on Sir Isaac Newton’s portrait – who had died in 1727). Notice the formal devices that make him stand out to us.</li>
<li>Bookshelves in the back indicates he is very educated.</li>
<li>An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system
<ul>
<li>A miniature clockwork planetarium.</li>
<li>Each planet with its moons is a sphere attached to an arm that rotates around the sun when cranked by hand.</li>
<li>Can simulate eclipses and illustrate the rotation of the planets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Enlightenment</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Enlightenment</strong> was an 18<sup>th</sup> century philosophical movement that shifted Europe away from traditional religious models and moved towards an empirical, scientific approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Science &gt; religion</li>
<li>Knowledge is for everyone, and knowledge should be democratic.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>English painter <strong>Joseph Wright of Derby (1734 – 1829)</strong> added the region he was born to his professional name, because there was another painter named Joseph Wright, who also lived close by.</p>
<p>Joseph Wright of Derby became the unofficial painter of the Enlightenment. He was known for depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods. The artist belonged to a scientific group called the Lunar Society of Birmingham. This was an informal group that met to talk about scientific topics of the day (Erasmus Darwin – grandfather of Charles Darwin was a member of this group).</p>

<p><strong><em>The Swing</em></strong><strong>, </strong>artist<strong> Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s </strong>much beloved<strong> oil on canvas </strong>painting measures<strong> 2 feet 8 inches by 2 feet. </strong></p>
<p><em> </em>The work shows multiple characteristics of <strong>Rococo</strong> style.</p>

<li>Aristocrats at play (<strong>fête galante</strong>)</li>
<li>Pastels</li>

<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>In 1767 a painter named Doyen was approached by an unknown gentleman who asked the artist if he would come to meet him at his “pleasure house”. These were spaces for men to be with their mistresses. Upon arrival, the gentleman asked Doyen if he would paint his mistress on a swing that a bishop would push. The gentleman would be placed in such a way that he would be able to see up the skirt of his mistress.</p>
<blockquote><p>Doyen declined by saying “well…thank you for thinking of me but I don’t really paint things like this. However, I know someone who does, and his name is Fragonard.”</p>
<p>This painting was the result!</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been speculated that the patron may have been Baron de Saint-Julien.</p>
<h5><strong>Fun and Frivolity</strong></h5>
<p>This work celebrates the leisure of the upper class. It was painted to be erotically tantalizing. It was meant to represent a game. Gardens are for play. The couple is playing a game. We are playing the game by interpreting the painting.</p>
<h5><strong>Upon Closer Inspection</strong></h5>
<p>There is a lot going on in this work, which makes it an <strong>intrigue painting. </strong>A scene of scandal, playfulness, and flirtation, suggests a secret love affair. The patron/lover in the lower left is looking up the skirt at the young lady who swings while a Bishop pushes her. This could be a possible comment on the corruption of the church.</p>
<p>The garden is fertile, abundant, growing out of control.  This is based on an <strong>English garden</strong>, with controlled and constructed outdoor spaces. It has the appearance of being wild and natural, despite still being planned and arranged. Here the figures seem to be in a private park, hidden away.</p>
<h5><strong>Iconographic interpretation</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Swinging</strong> is an association with fickleness and female inconstancy. It is in reference to the act of lovemaking, but swinging is also a reference to a cheating lover.</p>
<p>The <strong>barking dog</strong> might be alluding us to the fact that the scene should be quiet and calm.  The dog does not symbolize fidelity here, rather impatience, carnal desire, animalistic urges, and arousal.</p>
<p>The <strong>pink roses</strong> are a symbol of female genitalia, as is the <strong>pink dress</strong> and shape of the opening.</p>
<p><strong>Shoe coming off</strong> is a common indication of lost virginity and one who has succumbed to passion.</p>
<p><strong>Man’s hat off </strong>at the end of a long slim arm<strong>,</strong> is a symbol of an erection.</p>
<p>The <strong>man is embedded in a rose bush</strong> as a symbol of sex.</p>
<p><strong>Rake on the ground</strong> is similar to a crass term for male genitalia in French.</p>
<p>The <strong>shushing cupid</strong> is based on a statue that was in Madame de Pompadour’s home (a famous woman known for love) and heightens the illicit nature of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Dolphins </strong>are a reference to Venus because she was pulled to the shore by dolphins. <strong>Putti </strong>is Cupid’s friends sitting on top of the dolphin.</p>
<p><strong>The garden</strong> is fertile, abundant, and wild with unbridled passion.</p>
<h5><strong>Leisure of the French Aristocracy</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Indulgences</strong> that characterized the French aristocracy before the Revolution included the pursuit of pleasure, and playfulness. Games were very popular. This calls attention to the amount of leisure time they had. Games were also symbols of the poor. It was trendy to “play” poor and simple, like farm girls and peasant boys.</p>
<p>The strict rules of conduct were loosened in these societal situations. Additionally, by participating in these activities, aristocrats believed they received health benefits or relaxation, while stimulating both their senses and intellect. This combated boredom!</p>
<p><strong>Public parks</strong> and <strong>private gardens</strong> were increasingly popular. These were places where flirtatious physical interactions were allowed.</p>
<h5><strong>Aristocrats, Status and Art </strong></h5>
<p>Artistic renderings of aristocrats playing and being frivolous were very popular. Showcasing such works was a sign of status. By definition, aristocrats did not have jobs. They existed to express their status.</p>
<p>There was also a new element of freedom. After the French Revolution and the death of Louis XIV the aristocrats who had previously lived in the rigid ceremonial world of the king, were now free to celebrate themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Monticello </strong>created by<strong> Thomas Jefferson </strong>is a structure crafted with<strong> brick, glass, stone, and wood. </strong>It is in<strong> Virginia, US. </strong>The floor plan is not very Neoclassical. Jefferson planned this part before he was influenced by Neoclassicism, but by then it had already been built.</p>
<p><strong>Monticello</strong> was inspired by Palladian classicism (Villa Rotunda) and Pantheon.</p>
<p>The <strong>west garden façade view</strong> has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetrical three-story brick home, balanced</li>
<li>Doric entablature; two-column extended portico; four Doric columns wide</li>
<li>Triangular pediment decorated by a semi-circular window</li>
<li>Octagonal drum and shallow dome</li>
<li>Wooden balustrade that circles roofline</li>
<li>Brick building, stucco applied to give the look of marble</li>
</ul>

<p>Jefferson chose to make his own bricks from the clay on his land. He used local timber, stone, and locally made nails. This saved him a great deal of money&#8212; as did the slave labor!</p>
<h5><strong>Symmetrical Interior Design</strong></h5>
<p>The numerous, tall French doors and windows allow for circulation in humid Virginia.</p>
<p>Jefferson was obsessed with saving space. There is a very narrow spiral staircase. Beds are in alcoves or in walls.</p>
<p>As he disliked dark and cold corners, he preferred a nice octagonal room.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This was both a<strong> domestic space </strong>and a<strong> private space, </strong>as it was a plantation home.<strong>  </strong>It was built for comfort, entertainment and personal style. These were new ideas. The fact that architecture could display these things was a new and very modern idea in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h5><strong>Picking A Style</strong></h5>
<p>Jefferson’s choice was sure to display religious and political ideas. He needed to choose carefully and avoid certain styles.</p>
<p><strong>French Baroque</strong> would have connections to Louis XIV and absolutism. Jefferson felt <strong>English Baroque</strong> was too British for an American audience.  <strong>Italian Baroque </strong>was considered too Catholic and religious, and Jefferson did not want to set a religious precedent. <strong>Rococo</strong> was too frilly, playful, and lacked seriousness.</p>
<p><strong>Neoclassicism</strong> embodied democracy, aspirations, the classics, freedom, and civic pride. It symbolized a return to <strong>democratic traditions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jefferson believed art was a powerful tool and could encourage American aspirations.</li>
<li>Classics symbolized aspirations of the new American republic.</li>
<li>Classics symbolized America was the inheritor of classical democracy.</li>
<li>Classics invoked ideas regarding freedom, self-determination, prosperity, education, democracy, and civic responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Monticello </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">means “Little Mountain” in Italian, as the house sits atop a hill outside of Charlottesville, Virginia.</span></p>
<p>This was Jefferson’s plantation home.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Jefferson was one of the earliest supporters of <strong>Neoclassical architecture</strong> in the US. He was considered a “gentleman architect”, who was not a professional but highly educated.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>1768:</strong> Construction begins. The hill was cleared and leveled through slave labor.</p>
<p><strong>1771:</strong>  First phase (foundation) was completed (Neoclassicism hasn’t been invented yet).</p>
<p><strong>1784-1789</strong>: Jefferson left for France as an American minister. He observed Neoclassicism in France/Italy.</p>
<p><strong>1789:</strong></p>
<p>Returned to Monticello and began to redesign it along French neoclassicism lines. He was already stuck with a floorplan which is not very Neoclassical. But he changed the interior and exterior design to add Neoclassical elements</p>
<p><strong>1809:</strong> The house was finished.</p>

<p><strong><em>Oath of the Horatii </em></strong>an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> <strong>Neoclassical</strong> work by <strong>Jacques-Louis David </strong>measures<strong> 10 feet and 8 inches by 14 feet.</strong></p>
<p>Characteristics of Neoclassicism include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classical subject</strong> AKA history painting</li>
<li><strong>Classical</strong> <strong>setting</strong> and architecture and clothing</li>
<li><strong>Figures are parallel</strong> to picture plane, pushed forward like a Roman relief, set in a Roman atrium dominated by three arches at the back, and uses Doric order.</li>
<li>Idealized</li>
<li>Linear perspective</li>
<li><strong>Licked finish</strong> using invisible brushstrokes so small it is as if a cat licked it.</li>
<li>History painting is large size, low horizon line, idealized and large figures, didactic, historical subject.</li>
<li>Tripartite composition</li>
<li>Men: vigorous, powerful, animated, emphatic, muscled arms in rigid salute; comprised of straight strong lines</li>
<li>Women are curvilinear, soft, rounded, collapsed, slumped</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Made for a King</strong></h5>
<p>The patron was <strong>Louis XVI</strong>. France was on the brink of revolution. Louis wanted this to be a statement of loyalty to the monarchy, and he loved this work when it was exhibited.</p>
<h5><strong>Fixing Society Through Art</strong></h5>
<p>David had other ideas – he wanted it to rally republicans as opposed to monarchists. He painted this in Rome after looking at ancient Roman sculpture, paintings, and friezes.  He believed the classics were superior. David wanted to return ancient masculinity and strength to France to reject the frilly, decadent Rococo.</p>
<h5><strong>Political Self-Sacrifice</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Great change will take great sacrifice and great loss. It is still necessary.</li>
<li>Must make sacrifices for the greater good</li>
<li>Willingness to die for a principal</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Exemplum virtutis</strong> is a painting that depicts a bold or powerful model of virtue or a didactic moral message.</p>
<p>The story of <strong><em>Oath of Horatii</em></strong> is a legend that was discussed by Roman historian Livy. It is about a conflict between the Romans and rivals in the nearby Alba. The warring had reached a stalemate. To prevent further deaths, three combatants from both sides pledged to fight on behalf of the cities. The Romans selects the three Horatii brothers while the Albans choose the three Curatii brothers.</p>
<p>One of the women on the right is a Horatii engaged to marry a Curatii. One of the sisters of the Curatii is married to a Horatii.</p>
<p>The message is there will be inevitable loss, but you still must make these sacrifices.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>This is the first Neoclassical painting and the birth of Neoclassicism. </strong></p>
<p>In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome, the prize awarded to the best Academy artist. He was able to go to Rome for five years, and study art&#8212; all expenses paid!</p>
<p>After returning, his work was severely undecorated, anti-Rococo, extolled virtues of stoicism, masculinity, patriotism and honor. This was the reaction against the femininity, vanity, lasciviousness, and pleasure pursuing of Rococo.</p>
<p>He exhibited this in at the Salon of 1785 and people were amazed. They had never seen anything like it.</p>

<p><strong>Jacques-Louis David</strong> (1746-1825) was a French painter in the Neoclassical style. He was an active supporter of the French Revolution.  He was essentially an art mercenary! He would paint for whoever was in power at that moment. The work above was commissioned for Louis XVI. The artists painted it even though he personally agreed with revolutionaries. Ultimately, he painted Napoléon!</p>

<p><strong><em>George Washington</em></strong><em> a</em><strong><em> marble </em></strong><em>work by</em> <strong>Jean-Antoine Houdon </strong>is a life-sized sculpture standing<strong> 6 feet 2 inches. </strong> It is <strong>Neoclassical</strong> in style, but the American version is “down to earth,” simple, and less dramatic</p>
<p>Based on Polykleitos’ Doryphoros.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revives the restraint and idealism and control of classical Greek art (rationalism)</li>
<li>His stance mimics that of the <strong>contrapposto</strong>; sculpture in the round</li>
<li>Idealized, noble, casual pose</li>
<li>Alternation of tense/relaxed and straight/bent</li>
<li>Left as bare marble à recalls the idealization and simplicity of classical statuary</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was designed to commemorate <strong>George Washington</strong>. Its aim was to show that a legendary leader was also an ideal leader, capturing the <strong>duality</strong>. He was a humble private citizen and an honorable public servant.</p>
<p>This was commissioned by the Virginia legislature and installed in the capitol rotunda in 1796. This was the year Washington gave his farewell address.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This shows George Washington as a public servant. He does not wear a toga or other classical garment, but instead wears his military uniform.</p>
<p>Left arm rests atop a <strong>fasces</strong> (where the word fascism comes from). This is meant to invoke a classical column. Fasces was given to Roman slaves to symbolize their freedom.</p>
<p>The <strong>bundle of 13 rods</strong> symbolizes the original colonies. His hand rests on top showing that he unifies these colonies but also that he draws strength from them. This visually represents the concept of E Pluribus Unum – Out of Many, One. (Congress approved this in 1782)</p>
<p>He does not hold <strong>his officer’s sword</strong>, it hangs on the outside of the fasces, just outside his reach. This signifies he can be strong but should not immediately resort to this.</p>
<p>He is a private citizen. A plow rests behind Washington and reminds us that he is a simple man tied to the earth. This refers to the story of the Roman dictator Cincinnatus, who resigned when his leadership, so he could return to his farm (rather than Caesar who created absolute power for himself). This parallel shows how Washington turned down the office and stepped away from the Presidency.</p>
<p>The <strong>walking stick</strong> symbolizes that Washington was well-known as a man who loved to stroll his estate. This is evidence that power does not have to corrupt.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>After the end of the Revolutionary War, the new American government turned to public art to commemorate the occasion and develop an American identity.</li>
<li>A European sculptor had to be sought out since there was a lack of artistic talent in US colonies
<ul>
<li>Jefferson, ambassador to France, suggested Jean-Antoine Houdon</li>
<li>Houdon went to the Academy in Paris and won the Prix de Rome in 1761. He was a famous neoclassical sculptor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you create a new nation’s imagery/symbols? What is art’s role in this?</li>
<li>Houdon created an idealized, classical bust of Washington. Washington didn’t like it and insisted on being shown in contemporary attire.</li>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Uffizi</p>
<p><strong><em>Self-portrait</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Elisabeth Louise Vigée-Lebrun </strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet 6 inches. </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What does by “The Natural” mean? </strong></h5>
<p>This is not a real style but rather a way of thinking about a trend in portraiture. In fact, these images were designed to look as relaxed, natural, and effortless as possible. This was becoming enormously popular as artists and patrons disliked the pomp, circumstance, and opulence of the Baroque era.</p>
<p>Here you will observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual elegance</li>
<li>Precise nonchalance or contrived to look effortless</li>
<li>Idealized (she was much older here than she appears)</li>
<li><strong>Self-portrait</strong></li>
<li>Well lit, up front towards the picture plane, attention to fabrics is great</li>
</ul>
<p>This<strong> “Natural” </strong>work also uses<strong> Grand Manner Portraiture. </strong>This helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggrandize the sitter</li>
<li>Make them large, in the forefront</li>
<li>Appear gently idealized</li>
<li>Casual yet composed (“studied nonchalance”)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work was created after <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong> had fled France, following the French Revolution. She was in danger as a well-known royalist. She painted it for the Uffizi Gallery in Florence as an addition to their collection of well-known artists’ self-portraits. This put her in league with male painters.</p>
<p>She was able to occupy in a non-threatening manner both worlds&#8211;the world of artists, dominated by men, and the world of femininity.  She shows she can paint just as well as men, and is even friendly with royalty. But, she is not a threat because of her great femininity. She is pretty, demure, soft, gentle, and sophisticated.</p>
<p>Female artists had to traverse a very fine line of showing their talent to be equal to a man but consoling men and calming them by reminding them that their genders were quite different.</p>
<p>Critics called the artist vain and self-important.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong> was 35 when this was painted. She is looking at the viewer as she paints a portrait of Marie Antoinette. She was Queen Marie Antoinette’s official court painter and personal friend.</p>
<p>In the painting she sits in a relaxed pose at her easel. She looks very pretty. Her skin looks soft, with rosy cheeks, gentle curls, piercing eyes, and flowing silk. She wears a white turban and dark dress with a soft white ruffled collar – in the free-flowing Grecian style. This was inspired by the style that Marie-Antoinette had made popular at the French court. Certainly, not an outfit a painter would paint in. Yet, the brushes are ready along with a palette.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In 1783, <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong>, who specialized in portraiture, was admitted to the French Royal Academy, as the first female member.  Her entrance however was orchestrated by her most important patron&#8211; Marie Antoinette! Now, she certainly deserved to be there, but to many men, it looked like one corrupt woman pulling strings for another woman.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette was deeply disliked at this point in France. Many artists and writers argued that it was Rococo, and by extension women in general, who were leading France down the road to decay.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette, the Rococo excesses, indeed femininity in general, was criticized for having made France and men effeminate. This was blamed for all of France’s problems (debt, corruption, a weak Louis XVI, and a deeply disliked Marie Antoinette). Many believed the only way to end this was revolution.</p>
<p>When the French Revolution occurred, <strong>Vigée-Lebrun</strong>, had to flee and escape. This work was created soon after her departure from France.</p>
<p>The artist ended up traveling to Italy and Russia to paint nobility and royalty. She was enormously famous in her life and ended up writing an autobiography.</p>

<p><strong><em>Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</em></strong> by artist<strong> Miguel Cabrera is an </strong><strong>oil on canvas work </strong>set in realistic space. There is a naturalistic treatment of the body, and it is well-proportioned.   Note the use of variety in the background with color and implied texture.</p>
<p>Once again, we see the “Natural” style with some Grand Manner techniques mixed in. The work is casual, relaxed, and elegant, with a low horizon line, pushed forward, and a larger figure.</p>
<p>We can see the quality of artists have improved over works such as <em>Angel with Arquebus</em>.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This portrait insists on her status as an intellectual as well as a nun. It ennobles her as an intelligent and pious woman. The work also commemorates Sor Juana 55 years after her death, for admirers, who were likely supporters of Jeronymite order. She was obviously quite a famous Jeronymite nun.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is a famous depiction of the esteemed Mexican nun and writer. Cabrera modeled this painting on images of male scholars seated at their desks.</p>
<p>She wears the <strong>habit</strong> of her religious order and an <strong>escudo de monja</strong> (nun’s badge) on her chest (similar to Sin Sukju). This displayed the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation.</p>
<p>Her <strong>left-hand</strong> toys with her rosary, while she turns a page of an open book with <strong>her right hand</strong>. The book is a text by St. Jerome. This is a contrast between her religious life (rosary) and her intellectual life (books).</p>
<p>She looks towards us, her gaze direct and assertive, as she sits at a desk in her library. We see books on philosophy, natural science, theology, mythology, and history.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">Sor Juana was born a </span><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">creole</strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> (Europeans born in New World) in 1648.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>At age 15, she amazed people at court by excelling at an oral exam that tested physics, philosophy, theology, math, poetry and plays.</li>
<li>Her reward was to live as a lady in waiting at the Viceroy’s House
<ul>
<li>She hated it and soon became a nun to avoid a wedding</li>
<li>Joined Jeronymite order in 1669 as a nun (named for St. Jerome)</li>
<li>In privileged Mexican convents, nuns lived in comfort with servants and households</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She corresponded with scientists, theologians, and other intellectuals, and was a writer</li>
<li>In 1690, she became involved in an ecclesiastical dispute between the bishops of Mexico City and Puebla.
<ul>
<li>She told them they were both wrong and proposed an answer and garnered criticism.</li>
<li>She responded to the criticism she received as a woman writer in a text called <em>The Answer </em>which defended her right as a woman to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite her eloquent defence, the Church forced her to relinquish her literary pursuits and library.
<ul>
<li>She was forced to sell her library, musical and scientific instruments.</li>
<li>She had to write a document that renounced her learning which ended with “I, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the worst in the world” and signed it with her own blood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She fell sick and passed away in 1695 after caring for plague victims.</li>

<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People</em></strong> by French artist<strong> Eugène Delacroix </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 8 feet 6 inches by 10 feet 8 inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delacroix</strong> believed color was more important than precise academic drawing (He would have agreed with Rubens on this point.) In <strong><em>Liberty Leading the People </em></strong>note the contrast and emphasis on Liberty, the clouds behind her are white and grey and do not distract us from her face. This is a pyramidal composition with Liberty at the apex.</p>
<p>The work was completed in <strong>history painting style</strong> with a large canvas size and monumental figures. What is unusual however is that the figures are not calm, academic models or even models that are ennobled. Instead, while we do see urgency and power, we also see low class, death, and grittiness</p>
<h5><strong>Delacroix’s Purpose</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Pro-republican/anti-monarchist statement</li>
<li>Showing France in an honorable light</li>
<li>Visual commemoration of July 1830 Revolution</li>
<li>Manifesto that celebrates Parisians and their revolutionary drive</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Initial Reaction</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People</em></strong> caused an immediate scandal. It seemed like it was trying to be a history painting, but this was <strong>not an appropriate subject</strong> because it was too modern. Even though one could argue the Marie de’ Medici series was a “modern history painting,” these had been painted in the Grand Manner, and these figures were gritty, unglamorous, and dead!</p>
<p>The realism of the dead and dirty bodies, combined with the figures’ distance from academic models provoked harsh criticism. Critics said Liberty looked like a prostitute and insurgents looked like criminals.</p>
<p>The French government bought this to remind Louis-Philippe of how he came to power. After the 1848 Revolution, when Louis-Philippe was overthrown, it was taken down for being too inflammatory and kept out of view. Paris was concerned about inciting yet another violent revolution.</p>
<p>The work was moved to the Louvre to exhibit in 1863.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People </em></strong>depicts the <strong>July Revolution of 1830</strong>. It uses the conventions of a history painting, but it was painted this the same year the event happened.</p>
<p><strong>Marianne </strong>is represented as an <strong>allegory</strong> or a human who represents a moral or political idea. Here, the idea is Liberty. Here, she wears the Phrygian cap, a classical signifier of freedom from ancient Rome for freed slaves.</p>
<p><strong>Delacroix</strong> was inspired by Michelangelo’s nudes for the figure of Liberty. Marianne is monumental, and nude to the waist, in reference to classical nudes.  He painted her in yellow to allude to that classical nudity. Vibrant, rebellious, victorious, and fiery, she represents the will of the people. She holds a bayonetted musket in one hand and the tricolor flag in the other.</p>
<p>Men around her represent the different types of people who participate in the revolution. We see that all classes are united in this revolution</p>
<p><strong>Gavroche </strong>is a symbol of youthful revolt against injustice. He is based on the character of Gavroche in Victor Hugo’s Les Mis (Hugo and Delacroix were friends). Wearing a black velvet beret, worn by students, he has a cartridge pouch slung across his shoulder. There is a war cry on his lips, urging others to fight, while brandishing a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Bourgeoisie</strong> is the kneeling figure with a top hat that may be based on Delacroix himself. Notice the loose-fitting trousers and elegantly tailored jacket. This represents that the revolution is for the affluent.</p>
<p><strong>A worker</strong> wears and apron, shirt, and sailor’s trousers. From his dirty body, we can see he is a laborer.</p>
<p><strong>The ground</strong> is littered with the dead. One figure lacks pants. This is intentional with the aim of showing savagery, while also demonstrating Delacroix’s knowledge of the male nude.</p>
<p>Chaos, fervor, and passion is captured.</p>
<p>Notre Dame situates the action in Paris (also another reference to Victor Hugo and his book the Hunchback of Notre Dame).</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: Romanticism shoes <strong>PINE</strong> (Past, Irrationality/Insanity, Nature, Emotion/Exotic) and is full of emotion.</p>

<h5>About the Artist</h5>
<p><strong>Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863)</strong> was an exceptionally trained French Romantic artist. He was admitted to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, which was not associated with the state Academy, but a rival. Delacroix lived in Paris during this event. He began his allegorical interpretation of this moment in September 1830. It was exhibited in May 1831.</p>

<p><strong>Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) </strong>by architects <strong>Charles Barry and Augustus W. N.

This emphasizes the verticality, as well as Gothic ornamentation with pinnacles decorating the top, large towers, and large windows that emphasis the vertical tracery.</p>
<p>The horizontal balance and rhythm of the façade is a classical component. The architects wanted to balance the horizontal with the vertical.</p>

<p>In the <strong>windows</strong>, there are metal grilles, which were placed here after the fire of 1834. These were built to cover the windows in the <strong>Ladies’ Gallery in the House of Commons</strong> to ensure MPs were not distracted by the women while at work. This area was not accessible to all women (only well-connected, elite women) and was difficult to see and hear out of. This made the room hot and stuffy and when wearing corsets, some women fainted. These women became a powerful symbol of women’s exclusion from Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Suffragettes</strong> targeted the gallery during the campaign for the vote in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. In 1908, two suffragettes chained themselves to the grille as a protest. It had to be removed from the window for the women to be cut off. The grilles were removed permanently from the gallery following a house vote in 1917.</p>

<p>This was built in 1097-1099 under William II, son of William the Conqueror (from Bayeux Tapestry!). He wanted to impress his new subjects with his power and majesty. This was the largest hall in England (and Europe) at the time and measured 240 by 67 feet.</p>
<p>The <strong>hammerbeam roof</strong> a decorative open timber roof typical of English Gothic architecture. The roof is still mysterious to historians. This predates the point where builders could create roofs wider than the available timber. Because of this, it has been assumed that there must have been columns to support the ceiling but there is no evidence of any.</p>
<p>The room is used for banquets, ceremonies, coronations, law courts, funerals.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Pre-1834: English kings lived in <strong>Palace of Westminster.</strong></p>
<p>In 1834 the Great Fire destroyed much of <strong>Palace of Westminster</strong>, both houses of Parliament as well as most other buildings. Westminster Hall was saved through a change of the wind and heroic fire-fighting efforts. Wooden tally sticks (voting system) were burned in the basement when the fire started.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria had to vacate and build a new palace (Buckingham Palace).</p>
<p>A competition was held to see who would build the new Houses of Parliament. The stipulation was that the new structure had to be in one of two historical, or what were called Revivalist styles: Neo-Elizabethan (Shakespearean times) or Neo-Gothic. Industrialization unsettled people as modernity seemed ugly. When they looked to the past, it seemed beautiful and traditional. Both were styles associated with the pre-Industrial era and English ingenuity and craftsmanship, even though Gothic wasn’t English, it was adopted in England.</p>
<p>Neoclassicism was popular but was associated with revolution and republicanism. These were associations which Britain did not want to have, as it is one of a few European countries that did not have a revolution in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>There were 97 entries that included 91 in Gothic and 6 in Elizabethan.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Barry</strong>, famous English architect, won the competition. He estimated it would take 6 years to build but took more than 30 years and cost over 2 million pounds back then.</p>
<p>Barry turned to <strong>Augustus Welby Pugin</strong>, a 23-year-old architect who was an expert in Gothic style.</p>
<p>Barry designed the overall layout and Pugin added in the decoration on the interior and exterior.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Destroyed in 1945; was in Dresden</p>
<p><strong><em>The Stone Breakers</em></strong> by French artist <strong>Gustave Courbet</strong> was an oil on canvas work that was destroyed in 1945.  It measured 5 feet 5 inches by 8 feet 5 inches.</p>
<h5><strong>Realism </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Realism is an accurate and objective depiction</strong> of the world full of everyday scenes and gritty hardships of impoverished lives. The crisp precision of Neoclassicism was going out of style, but Realist paint is still not gestural like Impressionist paint would later be.</p>
<p>The word <strong>realism</strong> means it has been painted to look true to life. This involves a large canvas with large figures, befitting a history painting – but this is not a history painting subject!</p>
<p>Brushwork is rough – consciously rejected Neoclassical finish. Often people thought the work was not finished. The canvas often seemed dirty with muted colors of brown yellow and cream. Figures are isolated in the foreground with flat space and dark color.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work illustrates the artist’s concern for the plight of the poor.  This was advocacy (maybe even propaganda) for a class that has been ignored and not deemed worthy, either by society or in art. It is not meant to be heroic. This is an account of abuse and deprivation and exploitation. It challenged traditions of academic painting and asked, “Why are the wealthy the only appropriate subjects?”</p>
<p>There was no commissioner. The art world was moving away from a clear patron or desire. Now, the art market had developed. There was an ample market for works that artists decided to create.</p>
<p>This work was rejected at the 1855 Salon as “inappropriate”. The reaction to the work was disgust. Never had mundane activities and peasants been represented in art, unless ennobled and honorably working the land.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Courbet’s comment on the painting:</strong></p>
<p><em>I stopped to consider two men breaking stones on the highway. It’s rare to meet the most complete expression of poverty, so an idea of a picture came to me on the spot. I made an appointment with them at my studio for the next day. On one side is an old man of seventy, bent over his work, his sledgehammer raised, his skin parched by the sun, his head shaded by a straw hat; his trousers, of course material, are completely patched; and in his cracked sabots you can see his bare heels sticking out of socks that were once blue. On the other side is a young man with swarthy skin, his head covered with dusk; his disgusting shirt all in tatters reveals his arms and parts of his back; a leather suspender holds up what is left of his trousers, and his mud-caked leather boots show gaping holes on every side. The old man is kneeling, the young man standing behind him energetically carrying a basket of broken rocks. Alas, in labor such as this, one’s life begins and ends this way.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We see two figures work on the side of the road. They are stone breakers who are in charge of breaking up stones and clearing rubble so the roads can be made. This work was the results of industrialization</p>
<p>They are dirty, dressed in ripped and tattered clothing. We do not see faces and though they work together, they do not communicate. Not only are they isolated from us, but they are also isolated from each other. The figures are that of a boy (too young for this kind of labor) and an older man (too old for this kind of labor).</p>
<h5><strong>A Closer Look</strong></h5>
<p>Set in front of a low hill, it looks like the town of Ornans, where <strong>Courbet</strong> lived. The hill reaches the entire top of the canvas except for a small spot on the far-right corner. This effectively isolates the laborers and makes us feel they are trapped. Their entrapment is not only physical (in this painting) but also social and financial.</p>
<p>Even though we know that the space between them and the hill is very deep, the colors and lack of sky make the painting seem flat and almost claustrophobic</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>This work was destroyed in the WWII British Bombing of Dresden, in 1945. It was in a transport vehicle, with about 150 other paintings to a castle for safekeeping when it was bombed. Painted only one year after Karl Marx wrote <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> which impacted <strong>Courbet.</strong></p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution across Europe led to a two-class system, the Bourgeoisie who were factory owners and the upper class, and proletariat or working class.</p>
<p>The message is that the Proletariat was exploited. They must unite and overcome the bourgeoisie to create the perfect classless society. Marx advocated for a violent revolution if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Courbet</strong> turned away from his wealthy bourgeoisie upbringing to adopt a self-imposed vagrancy and Bohemian lifestyle. This was unconventional with few ties. It was based on art, music, poetry, and free love.  Think of Bohemians as the hippies of 19<sup>th</sup> century Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Courbet</strong> did not attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was not a formal member. This marks the end of the Ecole’s influence over artists.</p>
<h5><strong>About Courbet</strong></h5>
<p>French born artist <strong>Gustave Courbet (1819-1879) </strong>was instrumental in the emergence of Realism. Rejecting the French Academy and classical styles, his work focused on what was real. Think the working class and people living in the countryside. He was an outspoken political activist, <strong>Courbet </strong>died in Switzerland, while in exile.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Saint-Lazare Station</em></strong> by French artist <strong>Claude Monet</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>2 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 4 inches.  </strong></p>
<p>This was painted <strong>Plein air</strong> or plain air, meaning it was painted outside. This changed tradition. The artists who used this method to paint thought they should paint what they see and not bring items back to the studio. They brought soft aluminium tubes of paint with them. These were painted on small canvas, without the pretense of trying to be like history paintings. All materials were easily transported.</p>
<p><strong>Monet</strong> focused on capturing the essence of what he saw, rather than capturing formal clarity. The focus is on light, color, and atmosphere. Some areas are almost completely abstract, with loose, gestural, painterly brushstrokes. There is no sense of traditional modelling. This focuses on the play of light and color.</p>
<p>The hardness of lines is dissolved by the light. He used rapid, swift brushstrokes to create transience of smoke and conveys speed. Light is filtered through the smoke and metal grid.</p>
<p><strong>Is this that different compositionally from a traditional landscape?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visual movement going back in space</li>
<li>Framing devices on either side</li>
<li>Lines that recede and carry our eyes back</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Modern critics had urged painters to “<strong>paint their own times</strong>”.  A wide variety of subject matter suddenly became acceptable (and even encouraged) when previously this subject matter would have been inappropriate and unthinkable for painting.</p>
<p>Charles Baudelaire had urged artists to be “painters of modern life”. A painter’s goal was to capture the very nature of modernity, distilling something essential from its transitory, busy qualities. The traditional Academy challenged this. Why paint what was viewed as ugly and unattractive? It was a radical idea to paint real life, but it was an emblem of modernity.</p>
<p>A train is a <strong>symbol of modern life</strong>, which was perfect for Impressionist goals.</p>
<p>Novelist Emile Zola said: “You can hear the trains rumbling in, see the smoke billow up under the huge roofs . . . That is where painting is today . . . Our artists have to find the poetry in the train stations, the way their fathers found poetry in forests and rivers.”</p>
<p>A Series of 12 works were difficult to sell, however, as many buyers were not caught up with Impressionist ideas. Impressionists were not very popular in their lifetimes. This bothered many of them, especially Renoir. The term <strong>“Impressionist”</strong> was coined to be derogatory. It was used as a way of saying the artists couldn’t paint. They could only make impressions.</p>

<h5><strong>Context </strong></h5>
<p>Monet rented a flat near the <strong>Saint Lazare Station</strong> in 1877 and asked to paint the station. In the spring of that year, he exhibited seven of these canvasses.  Having previously lived in Argenteuil, a Parisian suburb, <strong>Monet</strong> knew the phenomenon of commuter railroads. It was a very modern idea, that people would travel to work in the city. He viewed the changes in Paris very positively at this time.</p>
<p>By 1877, Paris had been transformed through industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancements (Haussmannization of Paris).</p>
<p>Under the direction of Baron Haussmann, prefect for Napoleon III, Haussmann was asked to achieve many things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernize boulevards to both widen and lengthen them.</li>
<li>Build new facades on existing apartments and build new buildings (fenestration – arrangement of doors, windows on an elevation; use uniform rooflines)</li>
<li>Build bridges to allow commuters to pass more easily over Paris’s Seine and surrounding rivers</li>
<li>Build new train stations to facilitate travel in and out of city, while increasing the size of existing ones. Saint Lazare is tripled in size.</li>
</ul>
<p>This led to an <strong>increase of commuters and encouraged tourism</strong> around the city. An expanding middle class could support this leisure time and they had the money. Trains became faster, and more times were offered for travelers.</p>
<h5>About Monet</h5>
<p>French Impressionist <strong>Claude Monet (1840-1926)</strong> might be best remembered for soft pastel shades, of his serenely beautiful garden and lily pond, at his countryside home in Giverny, France. Other series of works include haystacks (1891), poplars (1892) and Rouen Cathedral (1894).</p>

<p><strong><em>The Valley of Mexico from the Hillside of Santa Isabel</em></strong> by Mexican artist<strong> Jose María Velasco</strong> is <strong>an oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>4 feet 6 inches by 7 feet 4 inches.</strong></p>
<p>The canvas is large, making it a landscape elevated to the traditions of a history painting. The deep space lends a monumental quality to the landscape. It has a dramatic perspective and vista. Notice the atmospheric perspective used. Higher horizon allows us to see more of the land and a focus on nature. The human figures are small.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This work highlights the <strong>connection between landscapes and patriotism</strong> in Mexico. It helped to define the Mexican identity, not just to the Mexican people, but globally, as this was exhibited at the World’s Fair.</p>
<h5>The Perfect Landscape</h5>
<p>A popular <strong>Romantic landscape</strong> was known as a <strong>pastoral idyll</strong>.  It was where poetic harmony and daily life united.</p>
<h5><strong>Aztec Historical Elements</strong></h5>
<p>The white peaks of <strong><em>The Valley of Mexico from the Hillside of Santa Isabel</em></strong> are the Popocatepetl and Iztacchihuatl volcanoes, that are prominent Aztec volcanoes. The subject is of the legendary love story between an Aztec princess and warrior. This is symbolized by the mountains.</p>
<p>Lake Texcoco is the lake where the Aztecs settled. The island in the lake is Tenochtitlan.</p>
<h5><strong>Catholic Elements</strong></h5>
<p>The middle ground in the painting illustrates Catholic history. The artist’s hometown is located at the foot of the small hill. This same hill was the site where the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego.</p>
<h5><strong>Modern Indigenous Historical Elements</strong></h5>
<p>In the painting the human forms are an Indigenous family in their landscape. The clothing connects them to Mexican heritage. The mother with children shows the future of Mexico.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>In the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, the first art school in Latin America was established in Mexico City. The Royal Academy of San Carlos was modeled after the Art Academy of San Fernando, in Madrid, which fostered Romantic and Neoclassical aesthetics.</p>
<p>After The Mexican War for Independence in 1810-1821 (from Spain), Mexico used art to establish its national identity (just like what Americans tried to do with the George Washington statue).</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jose María Velasco (1849-1912)</strong> was one of Mexico’s most accomplished landscape painters.  He trained at the Royal Academy of San Carlos, where he learned Romanticism and was encouraged to paint Mexican landscapes. During his career, he won numerous prizes and awards in national and international competitions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Starry Night</em></strong> by Dutch painter <strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring 2 feet 5 inches by 3 feet. Loosened brushwork emphasizes the physical application of paint onto the canvas&#8212; painterly, gestural, impasto. The colors are vibrant.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It often seems to me that the night is even more richly colored than the day, colored with the most intense violets, blues, and greens. If you look carefully, you’ll see that some stars are lemony, others have a pink, green, or forget-me-not blue glow. And without laboring the point, it’s clear that to paint a starry sky, it’s not nearly enough to put white spots on black.” <strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong></em>(September 1888)</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>The Details of the Work</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Balance (tree on left balances with hills and stars on right)</li>
<li>Low horizon line, which allows us to see more of the sky</li>
<li>Deliberately stylized and simplified
<ul>
<li>Van Gogh enjoyed medieval woodcuts: thick black outlines and simplified forms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Composite landscape: not based exactly on what he saw; he would not have had this view out of the window he worked from</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>Landscapes were popular in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and <strong>Van Gogh</strong> participated in this trend. People desired landscapes in part because of their dissatisfaction with modern city life. He painted not what he saw, but what he felt. This was key in Post-Impressionism.</p>
<p>A night-time landscape presented technical challenges he wished to confront.</p>
<h5><strong>C</strong><strong>ontent</strong><strong style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"> </strong></h5>
<p>The artist painted this from his studio in the mental asylum of Saint Remy. His studio did not look out at the mountains, but rather had a view of the garden. It is assumed that he composed this view using elements of a few previously completed works in his studio.</p>
<h5><strong>Sky</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Largest “star” is Venus</li>
<li>Whirling forms in the sky match published astronomical observations of clouds of dust and gas (nebulae)</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Town</strong></h5>
<p>The steeple of the church resembles those in his native Holland, not the style common in France where he was when he painted this. We see presence of human life but not activity. See the hushed village of houses.</p>
<h5><strong>Tree</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>A cypress tree is a visual link between land and sky.</li>
<li>Symbolically, cypress could be seen as a bridge between life (earth) and death (sky).
<ul>
<li>Commonly associated with heaven, graveyards, and mourning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong> Van Gogh</strong> was a Dutch, largely self-taught, artist. He produced over 2,000 oil paintings, watercolors, drawings and sketches. He did not sell any works in his lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Chronology of breakdown beginning in 1888 (exact sequence is not known)</strong></p>
<p>The friendship/partnership with Paul Gauguin broke down. Although<strong> Van Gogh</strong> thought they were close friends, Gauguin denied feeling close to <strong>Van Gogh</strong> at all and doesn’t want a partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Van Gogh</strong> cut off his ear and delivered his ear to a prostitute. Later, he asked what had happened to him, as he had no recollection.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>Van Gogh</strong> was hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, in Saint-Remy, in southern France, a clinic for the mentally ill. During his convalescence here, <strong>Van Gogh</strong> was encouraged to paint by his brother Theo. The artist often chewed his paint brushes. Paint was made with led, which could cause difficulty focusing and halos in front of the eyes. This is caused by lead-induced enlargement of retina.</p>
<p>He was medicated with a plant called the foxglove. If given too much of the drug, it causes patients to experience yellow too intensely.</p>
<p>While staying in Saint Remy hospital in southern France, he was able to spend hours contemplating the stars without interference from gas or electric city streetlights. He had never seen the night sky like this.</p>
<p>In 1890, <strong>Van Gogh</strong> shot himself in the chest, while standing in a wheat field.  There were no witnesses and he died there two days later. Some have suggested he was murdered. He remains in our consciousness as the quintessential misunderstood genius.</p>
<h5><strong>Self Portraits</strong></h5>

<p><strong><em>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?  </em></strong>By French artist <strong>Paul Gauguin</strong> is an artwork of <strong>oil on canvas</strong> that measures <strong>10 feet and nine inches by 31 feet and 4 inches.</strong></p>
<p>This work casts realism aside in favor of expression. It <strong>uses color experimentally to evoke feelings</strong>. This is one of the greatest Post-Impressionist qualities. Here, colors are stylistic, vibrant, expressive, and nonrealistic. <strong>Golds and browns set against blues and greens.</strong></p>
<p>The work was inspired by the Impressionist interest in flat fields of unmodeled color from Japanese art.</p>
<p>Proportions are ignored. Space is not logical. The work uses the stylization that is common in Oceanic art. The simple <strong>bodies are not modeled</strong>.</p>
<p>Gaugin uses cultural appropriation or <strong>pastiche</strong>. In other words, he took the style of the Pacific and made it his own using <strong>primitivism.</strong></p>
<p>The composition is designed and painted to recall frescoes or icons painted on gold ground. The upper corners have been painted gold to contribute to this effect.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Potentially argues the inevitability of the basic processes of life: there is no escaping youth, adolescence, adulthood, and old age.</li>
<li>Precise, complete interpretations remain out of reach for historians; likely it had private meaning for Gauguin</li>
<li>Reveals <strong>primitivism</strong>: utilizes native traditions in non-native artwork</li>
<li>Represents the artist’s painted manifesto created while he was living on Tahiti</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe that this canvas not only surpasses all my preceding ones, but also that I shall never do anything better or even like it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This work contains numerous humans, animal, and symbolic figures arranged across an island landscape with the sea and volcanic mountains in the background.</p>

<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Gauguin</strong> was a “Sunday painter” or someone who paints for his or her own enjoyment. He had a wife and five children.  After his career as a stockbroker failed in the early 1880s, he took on painting more seriously. He went to work with Van Gogh for 9 weeks – we know how that turned out!</p>
<p>He had cardiovascular syphilis and when left untreated, will spread to the heart and veins. Syphilitic sores on legs were often mistaken for eczema and treated with…arsenic!</p>
<p><strong>Gauguin</strong> made his first visit to Tahiti in March 1891. He returned to Paris in 1893. He then abandoned his family and wanted to leave behind all that was “artificial”.  He complained that Tahiti was not as exotic as he expected. As a French colony, he said it had already been destroyed by missionaries and disease. Yet, he was swept up in the exoticism of what he did see.</p>
<p>When he was 50 years old, he married a 13-year-old Tahitian girl. She became pregnant almost immediately. At the same time, he married two other 14-year-olds! He gave all three girls syphilis. He named his Tahitian home the “House of Orgasm”.</p>
<p><strong>Gaugin </strong>painted this canvas in 1897. Just after learning of the death of his daughter Aline, he decided to climb up into the mountains, paint this canvas, and then kill himself afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p>While he may or may not have attempted suicide, he certainly realized that saying this would make a good story. “I painted this planning on committing suicide afterwards, and then decided not to because this painting made me want to live again.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Gauguin was extremely self-conscious of his image</strong> as a bohemian vanguard artist and concerned with self-promotion.</p>
<p>A few months after completing this, <strong>Gauguin</strong> sent it to Paris along with several other of his works, insisting they be exhibited altogether in a gallery. He sent his friends careful instructions about how they should be framed and who should be invited to the exhibition. These facts show that his awareness of the Parisian art market and how his art would be received was of utmost importance even as he supposedly renounced this society by living on a tropical island on the other side of the globe.</p>
<p>Gaugin was hugely important in art history for beginning the path towards expressionistic color and (unfortunately) primitivism. He died in 1903 on the Marquesas Islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Coiffure</em></strong> by American artist <strong>Mary Cassatt</strong> is a <strong>17 by 12-inch work</strong> using both drypoint and aquatint.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Drypoint?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Drypoint is an etching technique. </strong>A metal plate is covered with wax. An image is carved or <strong>incised </strong>into the surface of the wax using a <strong>burin. </strong>Incise lines directly into the surface of the plate with a stylus while pressing down hard. This results in uneven, jagged lines where shavings curl up on either side and makes ridges. Rather than blowing or wiping those shavings off, they are left to give extra texture to the printing. This reveals the plate underneath. The printing part is cut into, while the non-printing parts are left uncut.</p>
<p>The plate is put into acid. The acid eats away at the exposed metal parts, leaving holes. The plate is heated so all the wax melts off. The surface of sheet is covered with ink, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. It will be wiped away from the rest of the plate. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Aquatint?</strong></h5>
<p>A layer (or more) of <strong>powdery resin</strong> is applied to the plate. The plate is heated so it melts. Then it is cooled to create a hardened, fine, but still grainy pattern.  The plate is placed in acid which eats away around the powdered resin, leaving small indentations in the plate.</p>
<p>The plate is rinsed, and then ink is applied, so that the ink will pool into the incised areas. Paper is applied to the top to transfer image using pressure.</p>
<p>Different <strong>tints and hues of a color can be controlled</strong> by how much resin is on the plate and how long the plate was in acid.</p>
<h5><strong>Influence from Japanese Prints</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Spare composition</li>
<li>Tilted perspective; love of flat patterning; rejects Western assumption of 3D space</li>
<li>Simplicity of line and form</li>
<li>See figures from multiple angles</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Repetition and Contrast of Form</strong></h5>
<p>Note <strong>the curve</strong> of the woman’s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair.</p>
<h5><strong>Limited Color Palette</strong></h5>
<p>The palette consists of only four colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>rose</li>
<li>white</li>
<li>brown</li>
<li>cream</li>
</ul>
<p>This enables us to focus on line and clarity. From an artistic point of view, <strong>Cassatt</strong> was trying to imitate the haziness and softness of Impressionist form.</p>
<h5><strong>Additional Notes</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Asymmetrical composition</li>
<li>Spatial flattening</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>Mary Cassatt’s</strong> exercise in <strong>Japanese techniques. </strong>It is based on <strong>ukiyo-e prints.</strong></p>
<p>There is a de-eroticization of women, showing a boudoir/toilette scene that is not sexualized. This is likely because of the gender of the artist. This is a twist on the traditional female nude that we have been seeing in art history.</p>
<p>It captures fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are <strong>two cultural influences</strong>. While the work is Japanese in form (mostly), it is (mostly) Impressionist in content.  This was inspired by a woodblock print (in Cassatt’s personal collection) of the daughter of a prosperous Japanese Edo businessman. Toilette/boudoir scenes have their art historical roots in Old Master paintings. Think Odalisque, reclining Venuses, toilette scenes, and women bathing for example.</p>
<p>This is a private moment of a woman adjusting her hair. <strong><em>The Coiffure </em></strong>means “Hairdo” in French.</p>
<p>The <strong>ritual of getting dressed</strong> for the day had a great deal to do with status, based on royal rituals with Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette. To wear elaborate hairstyles, one needed a maid. Yet, the woman here is tending to her hair alone. We see a working woman. This can be a comparison between the historically elite nature of the event vs. the everyday normalcy of this woman.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>voyeuristic element</strong>, but the body is not sexualized. Though her breasts are exposed, her chest and the details of her body are otherwise muted. No anatomical accuracy or detail is given.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>The was a wave of <strong>Japonisme</strong> spreading across Europe. In 1854, US Naval commodore Matthew Perry forcibly opened Japan to Western trade. Japanese goods flooded into Europe for the first time since the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Lacquers, fans, bronzes, hanging scrolls, kimonos, ceramics, illustrated books, and ukiyo-e prints were all popular. This inspired a Japanese style across Western art.</p>
<p>In 1890, Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris showcased an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints. <strong>Mary Cassatt</strong> was in the audience and was absolutely taken with these prints.</p>
<h5><strong>About Mary Cassatt</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Mary Cassatt (1844-1925)</strong> was born to a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She studied art in Europe and settled in Paris after befriending Degas. She regularly showed artwork with the Impressionists.</p>
<p>Cassatt rarely made nudes. Most often, she depicted her friends and family members with their children.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Scream</em></strong> by Norwegian artist <strong>Edvard Munch</strong> was created using <strong>tempera and pastels on cardboard</strong>. It measures <strong>3 feet by 2 feet and 5 inches</strong>. This is a highly simple work.  There is an androgynous, skull-shaped head, elongated hands, wide eyes, flaring nostrils and an oval mouth.</p>
<h5><strong>The Five Versions</strong></h5>
<p>This work was replicated into five versions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1702" src="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/122-Multiple-Screams.jpg?resize=990%2C435&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="990" height="435" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/122-Multiple-Screams.jpg?resize=1024%2C450&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/122-Multiple-Screams.jpg?resize=300%2C132&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/122-Multiple-Screams.jpg?resize=768%2C338&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/medievalarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/122-Multiple-Screams.jpg?w=1167&amp;ssl=1 1167w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<li><strong>There were 2</strong> tempera and pastel on cardboard.</li>
<li>Tempera on cardboard.</li>
<li>Lithograph</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>More About the Form</strong></h5>
<p>The colors are <strong>orange, yellow, red, and blue-green</strong>. We would expect the sky to be blue and the land to be orange, but he has swapped this. The high horizon line lets us see more of the landscape than sky.</p>
<p>The strict linearity on the left contrasts with the curves and rounded shapes on the right. The foreground and background blend into one another. Wide curves of the figure are repeated in the landscape, and it literally ripples through or affects the man’s body.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is part of Munch’s semi-autobiographical cycle “The Frieze of Life”, painting not what he saw, but what he felt. It shows internal emotion through external form. This is Munch’s feelings/experience of <strong>synesthesia</strong> or the union of senses. It’s a visual depiction of sound and emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></p>
<p>How does one convey experiences that are not visual?</p>
<p>How does one convey sensations that we experience with more than one sense?</p>
<p>Can art be used to depict sound, perception, anxiety?</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong>The theme of this work is <strong>death, dread, and anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p>Three main areas illustrate this.</p>
<p>The <strong>bridge</strong> extends at a steep angle from the middle distance at left to fill the foreground</p>
<p><strong>Human figures</strong> also display this. A <strong>screaming figure</strong> in the foreground, is linked to the landscape, as both are made of curves. One feels the cry of nature, a sound that is sensed rather than heard. The figure’s face resembles a Peruvian mummy that was exhibited at the World’s Fair in Paris in 1889. Many artists were inspired by this.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two rigid figures</strong> on the back of the bridge. Are they coming or going?</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape</strong> also represents the theme. The shoreline, lake, hills, and churning sky are reflected on the water.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Symbolism?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Symbolism</strong> expresses emotion and ideas. It ignores naturalism. Symbolist artists came from diverse international backgrounds.</p>
<p>“It is not the chair which should be painted, but the human’s relation to it”. In other words, it expresses emotion.</p>
<h5><strong>The Decline of the Traditional Art School</strong></h5>
<p>This was a <strong>Norwegian artist</strong>. The art world was expanding. One no longer had to be French, Italian, or Dutch. Therefore, traditional art schools were declining in their power and necessity in the art world.</p>
<h5><strong>Influences on the Work</strong></h5>
<p>Both his mother and sister died when Munch was a child. The artist was ill, depressed much of his life and suffered from synaesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>Passage in his diary dated January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1892, written in Nice, France likely is the inspiration for this piece.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I was walking along the road with two friends. The sun went down, and I felt a gust of melancholy. Suddenly, the sky turned a bloody red. I stopped, leaned against the railing, tired to death, as the flaming skies hung like blood and sword over the city. My friends went on, but I stood there, trembling with anxiety, and I felt a vast and infinite scream tear through nature.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What could this have been? What was he inspired by?</p>
<p>The unnaturally harsh colors were likely observed by Munch. It may have been due to volcanic dust from the eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883. The dust lingered in the atmosphere for 10 years making extraordinary sunsets</p>
<h5><strong>Desired by All</strong></h5>
<p>In 2012, a version of <strong><em>The Scream</em></strong> sold to a private collector for $120,000,000, making it at that time, the 2<sup>nd</sup> highest price ever achieved at auction.</p>

<p><strong>Museum:</strong> Philadelphia Museum of Art</p>
<p><strong><em>Mont Sainte-Victoire </em></strong>by French artist<strong> Paul Cézanne </strong>is an <strong>oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong>  2 feet 4 inches by 3 feet.</strong></p>
<p>There is a <strong>proto-cubist</strong> stress on geometric structure. You will see a co-existence of <strong>multiple viewpoints in a single scene. </strong></p>
<p>Are the views here always possible?</p>
<p>How can we see so many parts of the mountain flattened towards us?</p>
<p>How can we see the tops and sides of trees at the same time?</p>
<p>There are <strong>three horizontal bands in the composition</strong>. The band closest to us has foliage and houses. Rough patches of <strong>yellow, emerald, and green</strong> suggest a wide plain. <strong>Blues, violets, and grays</strong> form the mountain surrounded by sky. This alludes to atmospheric perspective through the bluish gray of the background. With its <strong>sketchy outlines </strong>this was not considered “finished” by academic standards of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cézanne</strong> used <strong>blocks of color</strong> to create forms and <strong>evenly distributed lighting. </strong>Our viewpoint is elevated, though we do not see how. Presumably, we are on another mountain. This in conjunction with the high horizon line allows us to see more of the valley.</p>
<p>A complicated pattern of diagonals can be found in each of the roofs, lines of the mountain, and arrangement of patches on the plain. This creates a deep, unified space that our eye can travel in.</p>
<p><strong>Flatness coexists with depth. </strong>Somehow, he has flattened everything by making forms using rectangular swabs of paint. Yet, we understand the illusion. Things recede backwards.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is yet <strong>another study on this mountain and valley</strong>. It occupied an important part of <strong>Cézanne</strong><strong> </strong>oeuvre.  <strong><em>Mont Sainte-Victoire </em></strong>poses a central question.  Can you use flat, unmodeled color to create the illusion of depth?</p>
<p>Can you explore coexisting views while flattening? In other words, when we flatten something, inherently we understand that to mean that we can only see one side. However, <strong>Cézanne</strong> thinks. “Can I flatten things and still create the illusion of showing more than one flat side of this object?”</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>There are three segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foliage/houses</li>
<li>An expansive plain</li>
<li>Craggy mountain and sky</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <strong>sense of stillness</strong> across the landscape. Note the absence of human activity. We see human presence though. The subject was not chosen for historical interest or picturesque qualities. <strong>Cézanne’s</strong> principal interest was to explore the formal properties of his surroundings. For example, the huge iron cross that was on Mont Sainte-Victoire, never showed up in any paintings that he did of this scene.</p>
<h5><strong>The Location</strong></h5>
<p>Mont Sainte-Victoire dominates the skyline of <strong>Aix-en-Provence, the hometown of</strong> <strong>Cézanne</strong>. The mountain’s name means Mountain of Holy Victory. It is associated with a celebrated victory of Provence’s ancient Roman inhabitants against an invading army.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Paul Cézanne</strong> (1839- ) was born in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. He developed artistic skills at an early age. Today, the artist is considered the father of modern art and a proto-cubist.</p>
<p><strong>Cézanne</strong> would return to this mountain more than 60 times in his career. Each time he painted it differently than the time before. He constantly tried multiple angles and points of views.</p>
<p><strong> Cézanne </strong>bought an acre of land on this hill in 1901 and built a studio on it.</p>
<p>Historically, within the artworld, <strong>Cézanne</strong> took Impressionism to its logical next step. What happens when you apply the loose, gestural brushstroke approach to everything, not just scenes of the Parisian bourgeois class? This is what <strong>Post-Impressionism</strong> does. It further pursues the Impressionist mission with simplified color, and broken lines and forms. It reacts against the naturalism of Impressionists</p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</em></strong> by Spanish artist <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong> is a painting using <strong>oil on canvas</strong>.  It measures <strong>8 feet by 7 feet 8 inches</strong>. This work fully explores abstraction and marks a radical break from traditional composition and perspective in painting.</p>
<p>The space comes towards us in jagged shards. The <strong>figures are aggressively abstracted</strong> into sharp geometric forms. The limbs seem at times dislocated. The figures do not have rounded volume, instead, they are splintered. There is no modeling as that would have created the illusion of roundness. The space is radically compressed and flattened, like a still life.</p>
<p>Do not let the rough painting and jagged form make you think this was quick. The result took over 100 sketches.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Picasso</strong> continued to <strong>examine the female nude</strong>, as artists have done throughout western art history. He created his <strong>personal fantasy</strong> by playing on the reclining female nude with not one but five women.</p>
<p>He also had anxiety about sleeping with prostitutes. There was considerable anxiety over life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, pleasure was linked to morality in an era before antibiotics.</p>
<p>Here he created his version of <strong>Cubism</strong>. This was a new visual style in art.</p>
<p>Picasso’s intense <strong>competitive nature</strong> drove him to outdo his rivals (Matisse) and role models (Cezanne).</p>
<h5><strong>Audience Response</strong></h5>
<p>The viewers responded with complete confusion, and disgust. They felt he had butchered historical art traditions. What possible reason could there be for this?</p>

<p>The title is in reference to a famed Avignon Street in Barcelona which <strong>Picasso</strong> frequented.</p>
<p>The work is of <strong>five prostitutes</strong>.  The women stare directly at the viewer. This builds on what Olympia had done for art.  <strong><em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon </em></strong>replaces sensual eroticism of traditional female nudes, with aggressively crude pornography. Notice the figure squatting in the lower right.</p>
<p>The faces are splintered and inspired by African masks. Two women push aside curtains, while the others strike seductive and erotic poses. We see that this has become a show for <strong>Picasso.</strong></p>
<p>Originally, the work contained two men, but he removed them. Why? If men were present, women would attend to them. If there were no men, <strong>Picasso</strong> was their focus. Viewers become the customers.</p>
<h5><strong>Desirable vs. Dangerous</strong></h5>
<p>Picasso frequently went to brothels. Across Europe, there was a growing public health crisis, with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.  Prostitutes were beginning to be seen as intriguing, and desirable, but dangerous. Getting an STD could literally kill you.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Faces were <strong>influenced by Primitivism and African masks</strong> that Picasso had collected. France was still a major colonial power in Africa. Many African artworks were taken and sold in Paris.</p>
<p>The work was also <strong>inspired by Archaic statuary</strong> (Anavysos Kouros). The figure on the far left shows this (one leg forward, arm down by side). Picasso had recently seen an exhibition of archaic sculpture at the Louvre.</p>
<h5><strong>Pablo Picasso</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)</strong> contributed to many art movements including Surrealism, Neoclassicism and Expressionism. He was a founder of Cubism, along with artist George Braque.  Picasso’s paintings often included dominant colours, like the Blue Period or Rose Period. Picasso not only painted, he created prints, drawings, sculpture, ceramics, and even set and costume designs for ballet.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Kiss</em></strong> by Austrian artist <strong>Gustav Klimt</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>5 feet 11 inches by 5 feet 11 inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art Nouveau</strong> means “New Art” with organic lines, simulating forms in nature and an emphasized on decorative patterns. <strong>Austrian Secession</strong> is highly ornate, decorative, fanciful, and feels dream-like or other worldly.  Here we see the beginnings of abstractions.</p>
<p><strong>Gold leaf</strong> was used on a highly decorative surface that creates both texture and reflection.</p>
<p>The larger male figure is characterized by square and rectangular forms.  The female form has soft lines and floral patterns with a rounded form.  The formal qualities such as patterning and repetition, make the space seem flat and as if there is no recession. The work ignores perspective, scale, space, modeling, and proportion.</p>
<h5>Function</h5>
<p>This is a new avant-garde treatment of traditional subject matter. Lovers are quite common in art history, but these lovers don’t look anything like other lovers we have seen.  Think: <em>The Swing</em>. The artists rejected the Vienna art establishment.</p>
<p>The theme of lovers preoccupied <strong>Klimt</strong>. This shows love as an icon and something to be worshipped and adored. This illustrates a transcendent universal experience even in times of great change and modernization. The work is an ideal of what love can be.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>This is the <strong>theme of lovers</strong>, united through a kiss. They are embracing in a field of flowers which is reminiscent of fertility, and vibrancy. The man is bent over the woman, and she clings tightly to him as he kisses her. They are dangerously close to the edge of the precipice. This is likely due to the fin de siècle anxiety expressed through the danger and beauty of their passion.</p>
<p>The <strong>golden halo</strong> surrounds the couple, and unites them, as they are lost in the kiss</p>
<p>The <strong>man</strong> is physically powerful. We see the intensity of his desire. He is larger and dominates her. This is detailed, with <strong>rectangular and square forms</strong>. The <strong>woman</strong> is passively falling into his embrace. This is detailed with <strong>ovals and circles</strong>.</p>
<p>Love transports them out of our world. The background is flat and gold, unlike our world. This is similar to the Byzantine use of gold. They are transported to a sacred infinite world.</p>
<p><strong>Klimt</strong> follows tradition in the gender representations of the two figures&#8212;also Byzantine conventions, in this theme of lovers</p>
<h5><strong>Fin de siècle</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Fin de siècle</strong> or end of an era was at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century to 1914. Society changed rapidly during the late 19<sup>th</sup>early to the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The middle class was growing and so too was their wealth. This was characterized by decadence, excitement, extravagance. On the reverse this was also a time of anxiety and worry about increasing agitations across Europe.</p>
<p>Art became a form of escapism.</p>
<h5><strong>1897: Austrian Secession</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Austrian artists objected to the conservatism of the Vienna art establishment.</li>
<li>Klimt was the president of the Austrian Secessionists.</li>
<li>Created their own exhibition space to explore what art could be without the strictures of the academy.</li>
<li>Time of incredible innovation</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>Austrian born artist, <strong>Gustav Klimt (1862-1918)</strong> is best known for his iconic painting, <strong><em>The Kiss</em></strong>.  He is famous for his “Golden Phase”, which culminated with this work.  It was Inspired by a visit to Ravenna during his travels through Italy in 1903 which introduced him to the world of Byzantine mosaics. Other inspirations were the medieval book covers with flat Gothic ornamentation and illuminated manuscripts.</p>
<p><strong>Klimt</strong> was a sought-after portrait painter, who specialized in Viennese ladies. One such painting is <em>Portrait of Adele Bloche-Bauer</em> (1907), a painting, now with its own layered history, which sold at auction for more than $135 million, U.S., in 2006, exemplifies his stunning style, in fin-de-siecle Vienna.</p>
<blockquote><p>Art consumed Klimt and he was noted to have said, “Whoever wants to know something about me must observe my paintings carefully and try to see in them what I am.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>The Portuguese </em></strong>by <strong>Georges Braque</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>3 feet 8 inches by two feet and six inches. </strong>The work takes the 400 years of Renaissance tradition&#8211;form, color, space, perspective, modeling, recession&#8211; and throws it away!</p>
<h5><strong>The Goals of Cubism</strong></h5>
<p>Instead of a single vantage point, the viewer sees the painting from <strong>many angles.</strong> The fixed point of view is gone. Cubism breaks an object down to its basic geometric forms.</p>
<p>Letters added to <strong><em>The Portuguese </em></strong>make the viewer aware of the flat surface of the painting. It reminds us that the painting is <strong>a constructed object</strong> rather than an illusion to reality.  This is an <strong>experimentation</strong> with perspective, and a total flattening of space. It occupies multiple vantage points. Depth is limited.</p>
<p>The monochromatic color palette <strong>emphasizes structure over color</strong>. This contrasts with Fauves and Post-Impressionists.  There is no consistent light source, but a variety of shadows over the picture plane.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>There is an ambiguity of a clear, distinctive reading of the image. The central goal is to attempt to show <strong>numerous viewpoints</strong> simultaneously. <strong>This is a complete change!</strong> All other works, despite stylistic differences, viewed objects from the front.</p>
<p>This fragmentation leads to multiple viewpoints. It reduces figures into basic geometric forms.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The guitar player on a dock was recreated from the memories of a Portuguese musician the artist saw years before, in a bar in Marseilles. It is totally broken in form, with large intersecting planes.</p>

<h5>About the Artist</h5>
<p><strong>Georges Braque</strong> (1882-1963) was a French born painter and sculptor. He is best known for being a founder of Cubism, along with Picasso. Some of his other masterpieces include <em>Piano and Mandola, Violin and Palette, Woman with Mandolin, and Women with a Guitar.</em></p>
<p>The artist even designed costumes for Ballets Russes and other companies in the 1920s to 1950s.</p>

<p><strong><em>Goldfish</em></strong> by French artist <strong>Henri Matisse</strong> is an oil on canvas work measuring <strong>4 feet 7 inches by 3 feet 2 inches.</strong>  Here, the artist shows interest in abstraction and simplifying all forms.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Fauvism?</strong></h5>
<p>Fauvism uses <strong>expressive, vibrant color in a non-realistic way</strong>. Placement of complementary colors in close proximity makes them more active. On a color wheel, green, yellow, orange, red and purple are all in a row. This breaks with the traditional approach to color. Also note the bold brushwork.</p>
<p>There is an incorrect rendering of space. A study of ovals and circles, becomes flattened as they do not recede all at the same angle. This enables us to see the fish simultaneously from two different angles. It is not necessary to perfectly imitate reality.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>By depicting the goldfish and the water, Matisse captures <strong>a stereotypical Western view of an Arab paradise.</strong> He invites the viewer to indulge in the pleasure of watching the goldfish. He wanted art that would be <strong>soothing and calming</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the use of color in a new and vibrant way &#8211;like Gauguin.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>We see Matisse’s own garden furniture, plants, and fish tank.</p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Goldfish were introduced to Europe from East Asia in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Goldfish were a reoccurring subject in the work of <strong>Henri Matisse</strong>. He visited Morocco, in 1912, and noted how the local population would daydream for hours, gazing into fishbowls. People found them tranquil, entrancing and calming.</p>
<p><strong>Matisse</strong> admired Moroccans’ lifestyle which appeared to him to be relaxed and contemplative. This is a dangerous – but common – Western fantasy of Arab/Oriental life. We saw Ingres and Gauguin do this same thing.</p>
<p>The theme of paradise is prevalent. Even the name <strong><em>Goldfish</em></strong> defines these creatures as a shorthand for paradise and a golden age, with beautiful shimmering scales. Water is a common theme in Islamic art for cleansing, purifying, and tranquillity.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p>French-born artist Henri<strong> Matisse</strong><strong> (1869 -1954) </strong>was known for his use of colour and his originality. Primarily known as a painter, he was also a sculptor, printmakers, and draftsman.</p>

<p><strong><em>Improvisation 28 (second version)</em></strong>, by <strong>Wassily Kandinsky</strong> is an <strong>oil on canvas</strong> work measuring <strong>3 feet by 6 inches and 5 feet and 3 inches. </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Form</strong></h5>
<p>There is little to no discernible representation with a high amount of abstraction, but this is not pure, total abstraction.</p>
<p>Some characteristics of <strong>German Expressionism</strong> include <strong>brilliant clashing color</strong> as well as the use of <strong>color for its own sake</strong>. It is not there to mimic, describe or capture.</p>
<p><strong>Black diagonal lines</strong> are also characteristic. These crisscross and lead your eye across the painting. Look at the top left to bottom right. Then, to the bottom middle and to the top right to bottom right. This creates a sense of musicality and staccato.</p>
<p><strong>Automatism </strong>is letting the mind go and purely letting the hands control the artmaking. It is a very difficult process to use. <strong>Kandinsky</strong> tried but found that representation, narrative and content seeped back into the work.</p>
<p>The artist wanted the work to be mostly abstract because he believed if we recognized things too clearly that our conscious mind would take over the interpretation. We would then close off our emotional ability to respond to color.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Improvisations:</strong> paintings which were inspired by “spiritual events”.</p>
<p><strong>Left side: Apocalypse</strong></p>
<p>Why did he select the apocalypse? Likely he saw a relation or connection to the chaotic times he lived in.</p>
<p><strong>On the top left</strong> there is a mountain. In the middle left there are cannons and smoke from a battlefield (atmospheric effects of smoke). On the bottom left there is a flood like the Old Testament flood. In the bottom middle, there are horses/riders of the apocalypse (a clever reference to Blue Rider name) through the curves of the manes and necks of the horses.</p>
<p><strong>The Right side: Salvation</strong></p>
<p>To the <strong>top right</strong> is a church on a hill. On the <strong>bottom right</strong>, figures are kissing.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kandinsky</strong> was influenced by music, especially the composer Wagner, and he often named his paintings in musical terms. He associated his paintings with music and called all of them improvisations. He referred to his paintings as dissonant or a cacophony. These terms refer to sound.</p>
<p>It is believed <strong>Kandinsky </strong>had <strong>synesthesia</strong> (like Munch). This allowed him to see sound and hear color.</p>
<p><strong>Der Blaue Rider</strong> moves towards abstraction and simplified forms to see our world. It still uses still German Expressionist (vibrant color/jagged line) characteristics.</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Portrait as a Soldier </em></strong>by German artist<strong> Ernst Ludwig Kirchner </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work <strong>measuring 2 feet 3 inches by 2 feet.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressionism</strong> is defined by the use of <strong>distorted, jagged forms</strong> and <strong>jarring colors</strong> <strong>for emotional impact</strong>.</p>
<p>The composition of this oil painting is tilted up and compressed. The perspective is strange with harsh colors. <strong>Greens, oranges, and yellows clash together</strong> in our mind. It causes a sense of instability, discord, and anxiety.</p>
<p>There are intense, harshly contorted forms, roughly sketched and stylized long. Angular forms are inspired by “primitive” African masks. Even the female nude is jarring and sharp…very different from Venus of Urbino.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is <strong>a self-portrait of Kirchner</strong> and an exploration of the artist’s personal fears. It focuses on his artistic failures and sexual impotency. It is his reckoning with his own weakness. His frustrations with his artistic, masculine, militaristic, and sexual inadequacy are captured.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Kirchner is</strong> <strong>dressed in a military uniform</strong>. It is not in a military context however, as he is in his studio. There is a number 75 epaulets on his shoulders. This indicates his membership in the 75<sup>th</sup> Field Artillery Regiment. Symbols on his cap represent the German Reich.</p>
<p><strong>Kirchner</strong> appears sallow, harsh, edgy, angular, yellow, and sickly. He holds a limp cigarette in his mouth in reference to his physical and sexual inadequacies.</p>
<p><strong>Kirchner </strong>has an amputated arm that is bloody. This is a symbol of his inadequacies. The amputation is a metaphor for his “artist’s block”. He felt like he couldn’t create, and when he did, it was not well-received.</p>
<p>What about the nude that stands behind him almost like a statue? The figure is very different from the fleshy, attractive, inviting bodies we have seen in <strong>Venus of Urbino</strong> and <strong>La Grande Odalisque</strong>.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>Kirchner</strong> stands in his studio with everything he would need to make love and make art, and instead he can do neither.</p>
<h5><strong>A Timeline</strong></h5>
<p>In <strong>1905 </strong>Kirchner <strong>helped found the German Expressionist group Die Brücke</strong> (The Bridge). They believed they would be a bridge to the future. They promoted an entirely new way of being an artist. The focus was on distorted, jagged forms and color to display emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Die Brücke artists</strong> were interested in “primitive” art, particularly from Africa. They believed “primitive” art was honest, direct, and purer than art from Western industrialized nations. Obviously, this is not a politically correct notion, but it had a huge impact on Expressionism. Die Brücke artists wanted to adopt the “natural” state they saw in “primitive” art.</p>
<p>In <strong>1913</strong> Die Brücke disbanded. It was two years before this painting was created.</p>
<p>In <strong>1914</strong> Kirchner volunteered to be a driver in WWI. He did this to avoid being drafted in a more dangerous combat role. He suffered a mental break down and was diagnosed as an alcoholic and barbiturate addict. He was discharged.</p>
<p>The artist returned to Berlin to paint but suffered a nervous breakdown again. Then, he lived in two mental institutions. He became severely addicted to alcohol and morphine. For a time, his hands and feet were paralyzed, and his limbs did not function as they should have.</p>
<p>Despite being well-received internationally (some argue he is as important, if not more so, than Picasso), <strong>his art was rejected by Hitler in the 1930s. </strong>Hitler persecuted artists who painted in a style that was outside of his “Aryan ideal”.</p>
<p><strong>The Degenerate Art Show in 1937</strong> was held by Hitler. He exhibited all modernist art he hated and 32 of the works were Kirchner’s. Hitler had over 600 of Kirchner’s works removed from public collections. Many were destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Kirchner shot and killed himself in July of 1938. </strong>He tried to get his girlfriend to do it with him. She refused and they had a huge fight. He went outside and shot himself in the heart.</p>

<p><strong><em>Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow </em></strong><em>by Dutch artist</em> <strong>Piet Mondrian </strong>is an<strong> oil on canvas </strong>work measuring<strong> 1 foot 6 inches by 1 foot 6 inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>De Stijl</strong> is the Dutch for “the style”. It moves towards absolute pure abstraction. There is an asymmetrical balance and total flatness. The image is simplified and non-representational. There is absolute abstraction without any reference to objects in nature.</p>
<p>The painting has no individual brushstrokes. This is very difficult to do.</p>
<p><strong><em>Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow </em></strong>uses pure primary colours of white, black, red, blue and yellow. It is abstracted to basic vertical and horizontal elements</p>
<h5><strong>Function </strong></h5>
<p>The goal was to create a relevant, new art style with the power to unite people. As a result of WWI, people had been so torn apart that they needed something to unite them.</p>
<p>Mondrian felt that pure abstraction was the only relevant, clear, and universal language. This could create the harmony and order the world needed this after WWI.</p>

<h5><strong>Context </strong><strong> </strong></h5>
<p>Art needed to reflect a greater universal truth as this was in question after WWI. Art needed to be accessible to everyone and free of cultural association.</p>
<p>Imagine <em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em> or Ndop figure. Depending on your cultural background, you can easily interpret those images or at least get the basic message. However, if it is not familiar to you, you must be taught.</p>
<p>What is the only thing that everyone universally can understand? Formalism and abstraction because there is no message to understand. That is the unifying power of abstraction.</p>

<p><strong>Piet Mondrian (1872-1944)</strong> was one of the founders of the Dutch modern movement De Stijl. He reduced his shapes to lines and rectangles and worked with a minimal color palette. He is best known for his work in the 1920s and 30s.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Jungle,</em></strong> by Cuban artist<strong> Wifredo Lam </strong>is a<strong> gouache on paper, mounted on canvas artwork </strong>measuring<strong> 8 feet by 8 feet.  </strong>Gouache is an opaque watercolor.</p>
<p>The forms are highly <strong>stylized and abstracted</strong>. Note the crescent-shaped faces, cloddish hands, feet, and long thin bodies. The color palette features <strong>blues, greens, oranges, and whites </strong>like in a jungle<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>There is <strong>an uneasy balance</strong> between the composition’s denser top and the more open bottom. There are not enough feet and legs to support all the figures in the top half.</p>
<p>The <strong>unorthodox landscape</strong> excludes the horizon line, sky, or wide view. Instead, it is tight and cluttered.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p>This is the artist’s <strong>emotional representation of the history of slavery</strong> in Lam’s native Cuba. It also illustrates how he thinks contemporary Cubans are viewed by Westerners as exotic and primitive. He uses stereotypes to combat stereotypes. This draws attention to the issues to oppression of Afro-Cubans and the harmful nature of Western stereotypes of the region.</p>
<p>Lam argues Afro-Cuban culture has been reduced to an absurdity, of both the exotic and primitive.</p>
<h5><strong>Content</strong></h5>
<p>The figures with <strong>crescent-shaped faces</strong> like African/Pacific masks, are in a landscape of Cuban sugarcane fields.  Lam often utilized symbols of Afro-Cuban culture, particularly Santeria (mix of Catholicism and African spirituality). In Santeria, the supernatural merges with the natural world through masks and animals. The figures are human, animal and mystical all at once.</p>
<p>At <strong>the top right</strong>, the furthest figure holds a pair of shears in reference to harvesting.</p>
<p>To call it <strong><em>The Jungle</em></strong> suggests a search for a primitive culture. We are not in an urban or civilized area, but an untamed wilderness. Lam paints <strong>sugarcane and tobacco</strong> which are domesticated plants. Sugarcane is alien to the jungle setting, rather, it is grown in fields.</p>
<p>So why the Jungle? It captures the exotic, wild Western fantasy of tropical Cuba and reduces its inhabitants to strange, mystical hybrids who are not fully “civilized”.</p>
<h5><strong>Context</strong></h5>
<p>Originally enslaved by Spanish and Portuguese traders, Africans were forced to work sugarcane fields and convert to Catholicism. Africans continued to practice their native religion in the safety of jungles and fields.</p>
<p>In the 1940s in Cuba, <strong>sugarcane</strong> was big business. It required the toil of thousands of laborers. The reality of Cubans engaged in hard labor was in sharp contrast to how foreigners experienced the island as a tropical playground. While Americans enjoyed Cuba as a resort experience, US corporations ran their sugar businesses. The US controlled Cuban policies for decades.</p>
<p>Lam painted this after returning to Cuba from a trip to Europe where he was introduced to <strong>Surrealism. </strong>Surrealists aimed to unleash the unconscious mind. This freed things that have been suppressed. It brought with it dream-like distortions.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Artist</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Wifredo Lam </strong>(1902-1982) was a Cuban artist and the grandson of an Afro-Cuban slave. His father was a Chinese immigrant who came to Cuba.</p>

<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>House in New Castle County</em></strong> by architects <strong>Robert Venturi, John Rauch, and Denise Scott Brown</strong> is a <strong>wood frame and stucco</strong> building in <strong>Delaware, US</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>“front” façade</strong> incorporates a floating arched screen in front of the home. This was done because the owners liked bird watching, and it camouflaged them. The <strong>“rear” façade</strong> was dominated by a <strong>pointed arch porch</strong> similar to a pediment and supported by four stubby flat “columns” that evoke the Doric order</p>
<p>The is no internal or external symmetry. It is unique and eclectic. Venturi said “<strong>Less is a Bore</strong>” in reaction to modernism and its simplicity.</p>
<h5><strong>Function</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>House in New Castle County</em></strong> was built as a private residence for a family of three who loved bird watching and music.</p>
<p>For Venturi, this is his summary of his Less is a Bore mentality. Rather than copy a specific style, he borrowed freely, juxtaposing, and reinterpreting different forms from other periods and styles</p>
<h5><strong>Content </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Playfully eclectic</li>
<li>Mismatched architectural features</li>
<li><strong>Exterior:</strong> Like many traditional <strong>American farmhouses</strong> and barns, the siding is white and gabled roofs have unstained wooden shingles; <strong>Greek temple</strong> elements (columns, portico)</li>
<li><strong>Interior</strong>: shows a music room; vaulted ceiling; wood decorations like ribs in a <strong>Gothic</strong> church; quirky wooden chandelier; you can see windows, with patio and wooden arched screen; colors that are typical for <strong>Southwestern</strong> styles (peach, turquoise)</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>The Architectural Team</strong></h5>
<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;"><strong>Robert Venturi</strong> (architect), <strong>Denise Scott Brown</strong> (wife/partner), <strong>John Rauch</strong> (Venturi’s business partner)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Venturi studied architecture at Princeton and the American Academy in Rome
<ul>
<li>Developed a preference for Mannerism and Baroque architecture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1966: published a book, <em>Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture</em> (very successful!)
<ul>
<li>Wanted to reject what Le Corbusier (house is a machine for living in) and van der Rohe (less is more) had done</li>
<li>Believed structures should have:
<ul>
<li>Contradictions (pieces that don’t traditionally go together)</li>
<li>Messy vitality &gt; obvious unity</li>
<li>Embrace elements purely for their decorative elements/aesthetic purposes</li>
<li>Inspired by styles of the past (opposite of form follows function)</li>
</ul>
</li>
