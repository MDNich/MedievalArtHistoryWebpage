The group are in darkened shades, being pushed out on the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>The theme here is triumphalism. Protestantism at this point in history is over 100 years old.

They outlawed <strong>simony<\/strong>, or the buying of church positions. The same was done to <strong>pluralism<\/strong> or holding more than one church office. They encouraged religious orders to promote conversion and used art to inspire the faithful.<\/p>\n<p>It was agreed that art should be straightforward,\u00a0 but not necessarily simple. The works needed to have clear messages, as well as amaze the viewer. The design of the church was simplified, so side aisles and narthexes disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>The Church decided to use its great wealth as a sign of its success and God\u2019s grace. Others saw this as a sign of corruption. Counter Reformation churches became more ostentatious and more expensive to build. The idea was to incite religious passion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About St. Ignatius Loyola <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>St. Ignatius Loyola <\/strong>founded the Jesuit order to put a stop to the spread of Protestantism. He\u00a0 also founded colleges for religious teachings. This spread Catholicism through conversion and monastic order.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-903\"

He was not tall but short, and very beautiful; his face was so aflame that he appeared to be one of the highest ranks of angels who are all on fire. In his hands, I saw a great golden spear and at the iron tip, there appeared to be a point of fire. This he plunged into my heart several times so that it penetrated me to my entrails. When he pulled it out, I felt that he took me with it, and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The pain was so severe that it made me utter several moans. The sweetness caused by this intense pain was so extreme that I did not possibly wish it to cease, nor was my soul content with anything but God. This was not a physical but a spiritual pain, though my body had some share in it \u2013 even a considerable share.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The way she wrote it makes the spiritual and physical sound the same.<\/p>\n<p>Bernini selects the most dramatic moment of the story. Not before the angel plunges the arrow into her, nor afterwards. Her pose suggests physical exhaustion, collapse but also ecstasy and pleasure. Notice how the arrow is plunged into her public area.<\/p>\n<p>She craved God, which in Bernini\u2019s image, means she craves penetration. Sexual symbolism to represent a spiritual experience. He uses human experience as a symbol of a vision of God to make it relatable.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Santa Maria della Vittoria was originally dedicated to St. Paul, but was rededicated to Virgin Mary, in gratitude for a military victory, in Bohemia, in 1620.\u00a0 The head of Cornaro family, Federico Cornaro, was cardinal in Venice, with important ties to Rome.<\/p>\n<p>Cornaros were patrons of Barefoot Carmelites, the order of nuns that Teresa belonged to. She had no chapel dedicated to her yet,\u00a0 despite being a prominent nun.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of Teresa Avila <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Teresa of Avila<\/strong> (1515-1582) was a Spanish nun of the Barefoot Carmelites. She had recently been canonized or made a saint in 1622.<\/p>\n<p>She lived in a Carmelite convent. While there, she\u00a0 wrote her accounts of viewing angels down. She also recorded her experience with levitations. Her diary was a best seller in 17<sup>th<\/sup> century Rome.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Direct Contact with God <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Catholic Reformation was all about pomp, extravagance, and drama, to grab the faithful and inspire piety in them. They were criticized by the Protestants, saying that Catholicism does not give the follower direct contact with God.<\/p>\n<p>Catholics began to promote stories that showed Catholics having these direct connections with the divine.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Bernini<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-912\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/89-Bernini-Images.jpg?resize=336%2C437&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/89-Bernini-Images.jpg?w=336&amp;ssl=1 336w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/89-Bernini-Images.jpg?resize=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680)<\/strong> was a sculptor, architect, painter, playwright, and stage designer, during the Baroque era.\u00a0 His father, Pietro, trained him, with an influence toward Mannerist sculpture, as well as Hellenistic works.<\/p>\n<p>The younger Bernini was employed on huge projects in Rome, while also in demand across Europe.

The square in Rome it was built on contains four fountains.

This new style was a reaction to the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century of Renaissance, which represented linear form in a very structured geometric way. Borromini took these geometric forms oval, squares and rectangles and choose to overlap the shapes. He also took classical elements from Greek and Roman architecture and molded them into new forms.<\/p>\n<p>Borromini was eccentric, brooding, quiet, and famous. He was a contemporary and rival to\u00a0 Gian Lorenzo Bernini and never was quite as well known.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 85. <em>Calling of St. Matthew<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Caravaggio.

There is also a window overhead in Contarelli Chapel which streams in natural light.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Techniques and Style<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Here Caravaggio uses <strong>tenebrism<\/strong> or \u201cdark manner\u201d There is extreme <strong>chiaroscuro<\/strong> or an effect of light and dark shadows. The images shift from dark to light very quickly without any shades in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>The painting has the <strong>Baroque characteristics of drama<\/strong>. The figures sit or stand on a narrow stage and the action happens close to the viewer. Caravaggio maintain the high naturalism of the High Renaissance but adds drama and intensity.<\/p>\n<p>He also employs <strong>radical naturalism, <\/strong>using everyday characters. These are earth bound common figures. Even Christ looks like a regular guy. He is barely elevated above his followers and there is only the fainted hint of a halo. Christ in this painting is far from the idealized beauty of the High Renaissance.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Dedication to Saint Mathew<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew <\/em><\/strong>is one of three paintings, by Caravaggio, hanging in the Contarelli Chapel, that are dedicated to the saint. Mathew was one of Christ\u2019s disciples.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew<\/em><\/strong>, hangs on the left, <em>Inspiration of St. Matthew<\/em>, is in the center , and Martyrdom of St. Matthew hangs on the right.<\/p>\n<p>The Chapel belonging to the French Cardinal Matthieu Cointerel chose him namesake Matthew as the subject of the chapel\u2019s decorative program.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew<\/em><\/strong> shows the moment of transition or spiritual awakening in Matthew. The work was intended to show the faith and piety of the believers and to inspire the non-believers.<\/p>\n<h5>The Story Within the Painting<\/h5>\n<p>The story is from the New Testament.\u00a0 Matthew is a tax collector who sits with other tax collectors, in a Roman pub. The foppishly dressed men lean forward to greedily count their money.<\/p>\n<p>The light in the painting symbolizes Christ and it enters with him\u00a0 He delicately and gracefully extends his arm outwards to Matthew. <strong><em>Calling of St. Matthew <\/em><\/strong>is Reminiscent of the hand of Adam in Sistine Chapel. This was intentional as Caravaggio was a big fan of Michelangelo.<\/p>\n<p>Christ points to Matthew and asks him to follow. Matthew is in disbelief and points to himself to clarify what Christ has just asked. This is one moment in time at the climax of the story.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-923\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/85-Close-Up.jpg?resize=435%2C718&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"718\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/85-Close-Up.jpg?w=435&amp;ssl=1 435w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/85-Close-Up.jpg?resize=182%2C300&amp;ssl=1 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Three hands (Trinity) point towards Matthew. The light cast on Matthew is the light of conversion.<\/p>\n<p>St. Peter is the heavy, powerful, burly man turned into the picture plane, who blocks Christ from being fully seen by the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The History of Art and Church<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>During Counter-Reformation, the church wanted to use art to emphasize that a personal connection to God was possible. This helped to make Catholicism real and accessible.<\/p>\n<p>To pull the viewer into the art it used moments of transformation. Think Bernini\u2019s approach for <em>Ecstasy of St. Teresa. <\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Unique Approach <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>While Bernini used a saint in his work Caravaggio, chose art for the masses, by bringing the masses into his art. For the first time, a sacred Biblical episode was depicted as a normal realistic event in the same timeframe it was painted in.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Caravaggio <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artist <strong>Caravaggio (1571-1610)<\/strong> was born in Milan, Italy. He was considered the father of modern painting at the time. When the bubonic plague killed his family, while he was a child, he apprenticed with Simone Peterzano, in Milan. He was just 11 years old. Afterwards, he moved to Rome where his technique in tenebrism proved popular.<\/p>\n<p>The commission for <strong>Contarelli Chapel <\/strong>gave his work exposure and more work would follow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Caravaggio<\/strong> led a troubled life with drinking gambling and fighting throughout.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>17<sup>th<\/sup> Century Southern Baroque (Spanish)<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Beginning in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century, Spain&#8217;s status as an international power was in decline.

Showing early artistic talents, he was already apprenticed, by the age of 11, to Francisco Pacheco, the city\u2019s most significant artist and art theorist.

The inspiration for the work was Japanese<strong> lacquerware<\/strong> part of Asian decorative arts that was extremely popular. This work uses a Mexican technique created to approximate that look called <strong>enconchado<\/strong>. Concha means shell in Spanish.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Art of Enconchado<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez is considered one of the best artists in <strong>enconchado. <\/strong>This consisted of placing tiny fragments of mother-of-pearl onto a canvas that sat on top of wood.\u00a0 Then the shells were covered with a yellowish tint and thin glazes of paint. This created a luminescence that could not be replicated by paint.<\/p>\n<p>Enconchado paintings often have highly elaborate frames. <strong><em>The Virgin of Guadalupe<\/em><\/strong> is shell inlaid with lavish floral motifs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Popularity of Virgin of Guadalupe<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Veneration of Virgin of Guadalupe increased because people attributed her with miracles and interceding on their behalf during times of turmoil.<\/p>\n<p>This work was created for individual worship and to display the owner\u2019s piety.

She averts her gaze and clasps her hands together in piety. Standing on a crescent moon supported by a <strong>seraph<\/strong>, or holy winged being, she wears the traditional clothes of Mary. This consists of a long blue cloak with hood.\u00a0 Roses decorate her dress and golden stars adorn her cloak.<\/p>\n<p>A mandorla of light surrounds her. Rays frame her head in reference to her crown of stars.<\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>roundels<\/strong>, the top left, top right, and bottom left scene apparitions. Each roundel is supported by an angelic figure.\u00a0 In the <strong>bottom right<\/strong> Juan Diego unveils her image on tunic to the Bishop.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Trade and Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Spanish Philippines traded with Japan.\u00a0 Japanese goods arrived in Mexico, via Spanish ships enroute to Europe.\u00a0 When Japan became isolationist in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century Japanese goods stopped arriving. This led to a high demand for Mexican artists to create some of their own Asian-inspired objects.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of the Virgin of Guadalupe<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The story of the <strong>Virgin of Guadalupe<\/strong> varies from region to region, but the basics remain the same. In December 1531, a man named Juan Diego was on his way to mass. He walked on the Tepeyac hill, formerly a site of a shrine to an Aztec mother goddess. Here, the Virgin appeared to him as an apparition. She asked Juan Diego to tell the Bishop of Guadalupe to construct a shrine in her honor on the hill.<\/p>\n<p>Juan Diego asked the Bishop.\u00a0 He did not believe Juan Diego and requested proof.<\/p>\n<p>Juan Diego returned to the site and saw her a second and third time. Finally, on the fourth meeting she told Juan Diego to take roses growing on the hillside and to the Bishop.<\/p>\n<p>When Juan Diego opened his cloak, the roses spilled out in front of the Bishop. The flowers were miraculously imprinted with the image of the Virgin.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately, the Bishop began construction on the hill!<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Tunic<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Virgin of Guadalupe\u2019s<\/strong> tunic was kept by the church here as a relic.\u00a0 Her image was made by an unknown artist. This image became the standard representation the Virgin of Guadalupe.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The artist, born in 1664 was considered the Michelangelo of Mexico.

Both the <strong><em>Golden Haggadah<\/em><\/strong> and the <strong><em>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene<\/em><\/strong> are rare and stunning works of art. Not only that they are incredibly expensive to begin with, but they reflect in a decorative way the education and intellectual curiosity of the patron and artists, who were familiar with many different artistic elements across religious and geographic barriers.<\/p>\n<p>The 14th century <strong><em>Golden Haggadah<\/em><\/strong> was a traditional Jewish book telling the Passover story for the holiday. It was meant for a private ceremonial use. This made it easier for the patrons to cross religious boundaries and employ artists who will use as inspiration the illuminated Christian prayer manuscripts such as the Psalters and Books of Hours. The injunction of the second commandment restricted the use of figures in the Hebrew manuscripts commissioned for synagogal use.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_445\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-445\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-445\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?resize=500%2C660&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?w=253&amp;ssl=1 253w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/64-A-Enhanced-Golden-Haggadah-Prepartion-for-Passover.jpg?resize=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lamentation<br \/>\u00a9 Scala\/Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Haggadahs were often illuminated using calligraphy, and decorative elements that organized the text: golden cartouches, full pages reserved for the tapestries at the head and end of the book. However, in the multicultural Moorish Spain, the illuminator profession became accessible to Jewish artisans, marking the beginning of figurative illuminated Hebrew manuscripts which would only be interrupted by the Expulsion to the Iberian Peninsula.<\/p>\n<p>Produced in 1320 in Barcelona and abundantly illustrated, the <strong><em>Golden Haggadah<\/em><\/strong> is one of the oldest rituals of the fourteenth century. The <strong>Spanish Jewish painting<\/strong> is marked by <strong>Moorish heritage<\/strong> and is also influenced by the very fashionable <strong>French and Italian styles<\/strong>. Its name comes from the golden backgrounds on which stand out the magnificent miniatures that adorn the opening pages of the manuscript. It is a masterpiece of illumination.<\/p>\n<p>The manuscript comes from a Catalan workshop where French influence was predominant in the first quarter of the 14th century. Its iconography, in Gothic style, consists of fourteen miniatures grouped at the head of the manuscript. The biblical scenes are arranged in four compartments per page, those relating to the ritual adorn the text. The miniatures depict episodes from Genesis and the Exodus; the first scene being that of Adam naming the animals, the last, that of Myriam&#8217;s song after the passage of the Red Sea.<\/p>\n<p>Next come scenes on the preparations for the Passover, where Miriam (Moses\u2019 sister) and her maidens dance and play musical instruments with Islamic motifs on them. The reading direction of the paintings is that of Hebrew writing, from right to left.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile the Mestizo culture of the New Spain openly encouraged the blend of the native and European cultures. The viceroy chose to celebrate the Habsburg power of the Spanish ruling dynasty and overlook the differences between the rich Mexica and rich Spaniards as his own wife was a descendant of the Monctezuma.\u00a0 <strong><em>Screen with the Siege of Belgrade and hunting scene<\/em><\/strong> reflects the cultural merging of the <strong>New, Old European, and Asian worlds<\/strong> and emphasize the New Spain\u2019s strategic location at the center of Spanish trade from the east (Spain) and the west (Philippines). This screen is the only known artwork <strong>combining the biombo<\/strong> (Japanese inspired folding screen) and <strong>the enconchado<\/strong> (the Native shell inlay). Inspired by Japanese folding screens and lacquer boxes the screen exhibits on top\/bottom decorative edges shining black margins with a rich floral motif embellished with gold and mother-of-pearl. The war and hunting scenes painted are of European inspiration. The inclusion of shell inlay in the composition of the war scenes creates motion as the sun on the shelf makes the soldier helmets shine.<\/p>\n<p>The inclusion of Classical Roman-Greek decorative garland is probably not volunteer just as it was in the Dutch printmaking. It was probably the lack of training of New World\u2019s artists in figurative painting that made the prints necessary in the first place. War and hunting scenes had nothing inherently religious and thus crossing the Protestant, Catholic barriers.
