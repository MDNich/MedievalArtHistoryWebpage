Churchgoers were confronted with agony, death, and sorrow. This was very different from the\u00a0 jubilant images of Christ that they normally saw in early Gothic art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Andachtsbild<\/strong> (end-ACHT-speeld) is the German word for devotional image. It puts human pain in perspective and reminds us of Christ\u2019s sacrifice and Mary\u2019s great suffering.

The Crown of Thorns has caused his face to bleed. Mary\u2019s face is twisted in anger, confusion,\u00a0 and anguish, as tears roll down her face.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A New Christ<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The is an early, medieval representations of Christ that is focused on his divinity. Prior\u00a0 to this Christ was depicted on the cross but did not suffer. Eventually, by the late middle ages or late Gothic era, this new focus on a suffering Christ emerged.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art Reflecting Life<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Suffering was part of the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century. It was a difficult time with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hundred Years War<\/li>\n<li>Plague<\/li>\n<li>Famine<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Artwork suddenly took on <strong>a tragic tone<\/strong>.\u00a0 Fearful churchgoers sought comfort and reassurance in the idea that Christ and Mary understood their suffering and the woes of humankind.\u00a0 Scenes of the Pieta and Mary\u2019s suffering became very common.<\/p>\n<p>This led to a period of worship called Marian Devotion. Mary was seen as an accessible, warm, motherly intercessor who could advocate for humankind through Christ.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Gothic Goes International<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>Late Gothic Era<\/strong> was so popular across Europe that it is known as International Gothic.

He wanted to atone for his sins of charging interest on a loan or the act of usury. Dante, in his novel, <em>Divine Comedy<\/em> even singles out the Scrovegni family for this sin.<\/p>\n<p>It was named Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel, because it was right by an old Roman area, which was part of the Scrovegni estate.\u00a0 This kind of art was known as good work to help the patron earn his way into \u00a0heaven.\u00a0 Enrico Scrovegni himself appears in the Last Judgement fresco on the side of the blessed.<\/p>\n<p>The chapel was intended for the private use of the Scrovegni family. It was a sign of great wealth to be able to build such a place.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Frescos Inside the Church <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are three registers of paintings, in reference to the Trinity.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top level: life of Mary starts with her parents Joachim and Anna.<\/li>\n<li>Middle level: Life of Jesus (Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Flight to Egypt)<\/li>\n<li>Lower level (closest to churchgoers): Passion of Christ (return to Jerusalem \u00e0 Resurrection)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The altar wall: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annunciation at the entrance<\/li>\n<li>Last Judgment at the exit<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>SUB-IMAGE (Lamentation)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_442\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-442\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-442\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=700%2C550&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/63-Inside-Chapel-Lamentation.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lamentation<br \/>\u00a9 Scala\/Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong><em>Lamentation<\/em><\/strong> is the scene when Christ has been taken down from the cross, with followers around him mourning him. It is a group scene of the event, unlike the Pieta, which was just Mary and Christ. A range of emotions are displayed: sadness, resignation, outbursts, and despair.<\/p>\n<p>Here, Mary holds Christ in a manner similar to other Mary and Christ Child scenes or Nativity scenes. She raises her right knee to prop Christ up. She puts her arm around him and leans towards him.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-651 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/63-Jesus.jpg?resize=300%2C245&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/63-Jesus.jpg?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/63-Jesus.jpg?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The diagonal cliff formation points the eye to the main action placed in the lower-left hand corner.

Here is how this is used in <em>Lamentation<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The land is baren except for a single dead tree. This is the Tree of Life, which withered at the fall of Adam.\u00a0 Christ is often thought of as the second Adam. This also gives reference to Winter and Christ\u2019s death, before Spring and the eventual resolution.<\/p>\n<p>In the quatrefoil to the left, Jonah is being swallowed by a whale, from the Old Testament story.\u00a0 Jonah is often seen as a typological precursor to Christ.\u00a0 He suffered a \u201cdeath\u201d in the belly of the whale for three days. Then he was spit out. This was seen as a resurrection.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Giotto di Bondone (1276- 1377)<\/strong> is considered the first artist of the Renaissance because he departs from the Gothic style and begins to place three-dimensional solid figures in a real and logical space. Art historians speculate that he was trained by Florentine painter, Cimabue, because their styles were so similar.<\/p>\n<p>Born just outside of Florence, he would paint chapels in not only Florence, but Assisi, Rome, Padua, and Naples. He is regarded as the most important Italian painter in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-648\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/14th-Century-Italy-Around-1400.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-648\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/14th-Century-Italy-Around-1400.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>14th CENTURY ART Theme: \u201cGrowing Interest in Reality\u201d The Florentines began to pursue art forms that rendered the world around &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/14th-century-art\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">14th Century Art<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[10,9,11],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/643"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=643"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/643\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":851,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/643\/revisions\/851"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=643"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=643"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=643"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
