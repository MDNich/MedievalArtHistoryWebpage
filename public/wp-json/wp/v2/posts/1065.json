Note the similarities and differences in the cultures, as well as in materials, processes, and techniques.<\/p>\n<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is among the world\u2019s oldest artistic traditions. Although its roots lie in northern \u00a0Asia, it developed independently between 10,000 BCE and 1492 CE, which marked the beginning of the European invasions.<\/p>\n<p>Regions and cultures are referred to\u00a0 as the <strong>Indigenous<\/strong> <strong>Americas<\/strong> to signal the priority of First Nations cultural traditions over those of the colonizing and migrant peoples that have progressively taken over the American continents for the past 500 years.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Categorization of the Art of Indigenous Americas\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Art of the Indigenous Americas is <strong>categorized <\/strong><strong>by<\/strong> <strong>geography<\/strong> <strong>and<\/strong> <strong>chronology<\/strong> into the designations of <strong>Ancient<\/strong><strong> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0America<\/strong> and <strong>Native<\/strong> <strong>North<\/strong> <strong>America<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Ancient<\/strong> <strong>America<\/strong> is the category used for art created before 1550 century, south of the current United States\u2013Mexico border. This region is traditionally divided into three main areas of culture\u2014 <strong>Mesoamerica, Central America*, Andean South America.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica <\/strong><strong>in Focus<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Ancient Mesoamerica <\/strong>encompassed what is now <strong>Mexico<\/strong>, from Mexico City southward. It also includes <strong>Guatemala, Belize<\/strong>, and western <strong>Honduras<\/strong>, from 15,000 BCE to 1521 CE. The time of the Mexica (Aztec) downfall.<\/p>\n<p>General cultural similarities of ancient Mesoamerica include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar calendars<\/li>\n<li>Pyramidal stepped structures,<\/li>\n<li>Sites and buildings oriented in relation to sacred mountains and celestial phenomena.<\/li>\n<li>Highly valued green materials, such as jadeite and quetzal feathers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Cultures and Styles<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The styles from the various Mesoamerican cultures differed markedly.<\/p>\n<p>Three major distinct cultures and styles of Ancient Mesoamerica (Middle America) were the <strong>Olmec<\/strong>, <strong>Maya<\/strong>, and Mexica, also known as <strong>Aztec, <\/strong>the empire that was dominated by the Mexica ethnic group.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Olmec culture<\/strong> existed during the first millennium BCE, primarily in the Gulf Coast. <strong>The Mayan culture<\/strong> peaked during the first millennium CE in eastern Mesoamerica, the Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The Mexica culture existed from 1428 to 1521 CE in the region of central Mexico, though subordinating most of Mesoamerica.<\/p>\n<p>There were other important cultures including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Teotihuacan<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Toltec<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>West Mexican<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Mixtec<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Zapotec<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Mesoamerican Sculptural Works<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mesoamerican sculptural and two-dimensional art tended toward the figural, particularly in glorification of specific rulers. Mythical events were also depicted in a realistic, figural mode. Despite the naturalistic styles and anthropomorphic interpretations of subject matter, shamanic transformation, visions, and depiction of other cosmic realms appear prominently in Mesoamerican art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Central Andes<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The ancient <strong>Central Andes<\/strong> comprised present-day southern <strong>Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia<\/strong>, and northern <strong>Chile<\/strong>. General cultural similarities across the Andes included an emphasis on surviving and interacting with the <strong>challenging environments, reciprocity, and cyclicality<\/strong>, rather than individualism. There was a reverence for the <strong>animal and plant worlds<\/strong> as part of the practice of <strong>shamanistic religion<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As with ancient Mesoamerica, the Central Andes region was a seat of culture and art parallel to the \u201cOld World\u201d in antiquity, diversity, and sophistication. <strong>Baskets<\/strong> from this region have been found dating to as early as 8800 BCE, proving early peopling from Asia through the rest of the Americas was accomplished by Neolithic times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chav\u00edn<\/strong> and <strong>Inka<\/strong> were representative and distinct early and late cultures and styles. <strong>Chav\u00edn <\/strong>lived in the northern highlands with reach to the southern coast between 1200\u2013500 BCE. While the <strong>Inka <\/strong>between 1438\u20131534 CE covered the entire Central Andes. Yet many other important, art producing cultures existed between them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Ecosystems and Environments<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Similarities within Central Andean cultures can be traced to the influence of three significantly distinct ecosystems in proximity. These were <strong>the dominant Andes mountains<\/strong>, and a <strong>narrow desert coast<\/strong>. In addition, there was the Amazon rain forest, the largest rainforest on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>These environments play a central role in art. Materials were influenced, especially by the <strong>prominence of camelid fiber and cotton textiles<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Working Together<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The political systems included coastal diversity, as well as highland impulses toward unification. Other factors include overall values in the form of reciprocity, asymmetrical dualism, and travel across long distances.<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, most Andean art seems to have been made by <strong>collaborative groups<\/strong>. The best known being the <strong>Inka high-status <em>aclla<\/em><\/strong><em>, <\/em>the empire\u2019s most talented <strong>women weavers<\/strong>, who were kept cloistered.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Gravesite Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Peoples of the Andes practiced the world\u2019s earliest and most persistent <strong>artificial mummification<\/strong>, in many forms, from 5500 BCE onward. \u00a0Almost all art became <strong>grave goods<\/strong> for use in the afterlife.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Andean art tends to explore the <strong>terrestrial<\/strong> through <strong>animal and plant imagery<\/strong>, <strong>mountain veneration<\/strong>, <strong>sculpting of nature<\/strong> itself, and <strong>organic integration of architecture<\/strong> with the environment. It also concerns the <strong>non-terrestrial<\/strong> via <strong>abstraction and orientation toward the afterlife<\/strong> and the other realms of <strong>the cosmos<\/strong>. Shamanic visionary experience was a strong theme, especially featuring humans transforming into animal selves.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Native North American Art <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Native<\/strong> <strong>North<\/strong> <strong>America<\/strong> denotes traditionally oriented cultures <strong>north<\/strong> <strong>of<\/strong> <strong>the<\/strong> <strong>United<\/strong> <strong>States\u2013Mexico<\/strong> <strong>border<\/strong> from ancient times to the present, with an emphasis on the period from 1492 century to today. Native North America has many regional subunits, such as the <strong>Northwest<\/strong> <strong>Coast, <\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Southwest,<\/strong><strong>\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Plains,<\/strong> <strong>and<\/strong><strong>\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Eastern<\/strong> <strong>Woodlands. \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The various Native American groups may be seen to share larger ideas of <strong>harmony with nature, oneness with animals, respect for elders, community cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership<\/strong>, and <strong>participation in large rituals<\/strong>, such as <strong>potlatches<\/strong> and <strong>sun dances.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Post-contact art<\/strong> not only reflects these long- standing values, but it is also concerned with the history of conflict within tribes and between indigenous people and the U.S. and Canadian governments.<\/p>\n<p>Indians, Native Americans, <strong>North American Indians<\/strong> (in the United States), and <strong>First Nations<\/strong> (in Canada) are nonindigenous terms for the indigenous peoples. These people were inhabiting areas north of what is now the United States\u2013 Mexico border, from ancient times to the present. They did not have a collective name for themselves, being many different tribes and nations.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Indigenous Influence on Invaders<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mesoamerica has had an influence on its invaders and the world at large since the 16th century. Mesoamerica is the <strong>origin<\/strong> of many of the world\u2019s staple foods\u2014 <strong>chocolate, vanilla, tomatoes, avocados, and maize, known as corn.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mesoamericans discovered <strong>rubber, invented the first ball game<\/strong>, and included several matrilineal and matriarchal cultures. Recognition of the importance of this area in world history and art has lagged, but it increases as inclusiveness and multiculturalism grow in scholarship and popular consciousness.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Impressions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>When Mexico was first discovered by Europe, gifts of Mexica art sent to Charles V alerted such artists as Albrecht D\u00fcrer to the unfamiliar but impressive media and images from the New World. Colonial artists preserved certain pre-Hispanic traditions both overtly and covertly in their art. After independence from Spain, in the early 19th century, the Aztec were claimed in nationalistic causes, and national museums were created to promote ancient art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Incorporation into Modern and Contemporary Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Twentieth-century muralists, such as <strong>Diego Rivera<\/strong>, overtly incorporated themes from the Mexica past. Twentieth-century European and American artists, such as Henry Moore and Frank Lloyd Wright, were strongly influenced by the sculpture and architecture of ancient Mesoamerica as well.<\/p>\n<p>Being more distant geographically and aesthetically, Andean art was less well known to early modern Europe and current society than was Mesoamerican art. However, some key modern Euro- American artists, such as Paul Gauguin, Josef and Anni Albers, and Paul Klee, found inspiration in ancient Peruvian textiles and ceramics. Modern Latin American artists, such as <strong>Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garcia<\/strong> of Uruguay, blended Inka art and architecture with modernist theory and style, exploring a common abstract vocabulary.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>People and Language<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Indigenous culture continues. More than seven million people speak Mayan languages today, and more than one million speak Nahuatl, the Aztec language. The European invasions prevailed beginning in 1534 CE, but indigenous descendants of ancient peoples remain. Eight to ten million people still speak Quechua, the Inka language.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Maintaining Cultural Identity<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Although disease and genocide practiced by the European invaders and colonists reduced the Native American population by as much as 90 per cent, Native Americans today maintain their cultural identity and uphold modern versions of ancient traditions in addition to creating new art forms as part of the globalized contemporary art world. Because of the history of suppression and forced assimilation into white culture, the influence of Native North American art on modern U.S. and European art styles has been minimized. However, recent cultural revitalization of traditions and active contemporary artistic production by self-taught and academically trained artists keep Native American participation in global artistry alive.<\/p>\n<p>Strains range from self-conscious revival of ancient arts, such as in Puebloan pottery, to cutting political commentary on racism and injustice.\u00a0 Centuries of interaction with colonial and migrant peoples means that some <strong>imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon are now considered traditional<\/strong>. Likewise, in subject matter, the <strong>Spanish-introduced horse<\/strong> has become a cultural and artistic staple, alongside the indigenous buffalo, raven, and bear.<\/p>\n<p>European influence is inevitable but may be subtle. What is considered traditional is constantly changing. There is no singular, timeless, authentic Native American art, or practice.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(<\/strong><strong>5) 154.

Did the canyon provide ceremonial or spiritual significance? Did the canyon provide significant protection from environmental elements?<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>cliffs were eventually abandoned<\/strong> in 1300 CE. It is not clear as to why . Was there drought?

He ruled for 60 years from 681-741 CE and commissioned this site as well as many sculptural works.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Jaguar had a son <strong>Bird Jaguar<\/strong> with his second wife. Shield Jaguar chose Bird Jaguar to be the next ruler, even though he was not royal because he did not come from the first wife.<\/p>\n<p>Then from 741 \u2013 752 <strong>Civil War<\/strong> raged.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bird Jaguar<\/strong> ruled from \u00a0752 \u2013 768. He had difficulty being accepted by the Mayans because he <strong>lacked royal status. <\/strong>Therefore, many did not consider him the rightful heir to the throne.\u00a0 To legitimize his throne, he had decorative steles and reliefs added to Yaxchilan.<\/p>\n<p>The City-state of Yaxchilan <strong>collapsed in 9<sup>th<\/sup> century<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s a fact: <\/strong>Maya writing was not fully deciphered until 1970s and 1980s<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Women and the Maya Court <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Women played <strong>a prominent role<\/strong> in the Maya court. \u00a0They held positions as queens and mothers.

It is assumed she is buried somewhere around the temple.<\/p>\n<p>It was believed that when a member of the royal family shed his or her blood, a portal to the other world was opened allowing gods and spirits to pass through it.\u00a0 <strong>Letting blood was a sign of sacrifice and piety<\/strong> to acquire the favor of the gods. This helped to dedicate new buildings, legitimize kings, and commemorate births of children.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bloodletting for queens<\/strong> was believed to grant significant visions. However, medically, these visions were <strong>hallucinatory states<\/strong> resulting from large amounts of blood loss.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 161.
