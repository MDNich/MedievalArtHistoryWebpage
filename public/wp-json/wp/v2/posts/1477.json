This helped to shape the regional identities of people within Asia.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Shared Cultural Ideas<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The core cultural centers in Asia became home to many of the world\u2019s great civilizations and ruling dynasties, including Gupta India, Han China, Khmer Cambodia, and Heian Japan. The shared cultural ideas in each region and civilization gave birth to visual traditions that employed related subjects, functions, materials, and artistic styles.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Religion and Philosophy<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Many of the world\u2019s great <strong>religious and philosophic traditions<\/strong> developed in South and East Asia. Distinctive religious art forms developed in this region to support the beliefs and practices of these\u00a0religions.<\/p>\n<p>The ancient Indic worldview that dominated South Asia differentiated earthly and cosmic realms of existence. Certain sites were recognized for beings sacred, with an understanding of time and life as cyclic.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>religions<\/strong> that developed in this region\u2014<strong>Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism<\/strong>, and numerous <strong>folk religions<\/strong>\u2014all worked within this worldview and sought spiritual development, spiritual release, or divine union through various religious methodologies and social practices. The Indic worldview was also grafted onto the preexisting animistic and popular beliefs in Southeast Asia during several waves of importation and Indian attempts at\u00a0colonization.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art and Religion<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The practice of the indigenous Asian religions necessitated the development of novel art and architectural forms to support them. Uniquely Asian art forms include iconic images used in Buddhist and Hindu traditions. It also incorporates elaborate narrative and iconographic compositions created in sculptures, textiles, and wall paintings. These are used to ornament shrines, temples, and caves.<\/p>\n<p>There are also Buddhist stupa and monastic complexes, and Hindu temples. <strong>Raigo <\/strong>scenes are images that are associated with Pure Land Buddhism, where Amid Buddha meets the dead and takes them to the heavenly realm.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there are relaxing Zen rock gardens, sacred spaces for Zen monks to perform their daily practice.\u00a0 Zen ink painting also began in Zen monasteries.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Figural Imagery<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Religious practices associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism are iconic. Figural imagery of divinities and revered teachers plays a prominent role in religious practice. The wealth of Buddhist imagery in Asia alone would rival, if not surpass, the wealth of Christian imagery in medieval Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Figural imagery associated with Asian religious art may be found in temples or shrine settings or may inhabit conceptual landscapes and palaces of ideal Buddhist worlds.<\/p>\n<p>These images also appear in mandalas. The word means \u201ccircle\u201d and these works can be made in sand, or as thangka paintings on cotton or silk. Figural subjects are common in Indian and East Asian painting<\/p>\n<p>East Asian religions emphasize the interconnectedness of humans with both the <strong>natural <\/strong>world and the <strong>spirit<\/strong> world. <strong>Daoism<\/strong>, with its almost antisocial focus, thrives on living in harmony with nature. The <strong>Dao<\/strong>, and <strong>Confucianism<\/strong>, are more of an ethical system of behaviors rather than a religion. All three were developed in China in the <strong>5th century BCE<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buddhism<\/strong>, which arrived in China in the early centuries of the Common Era, shared clear affinities with the indigenous Chinese religions through its focus on <strong>nature, interconnectedness<\/strong>, and <strong>appropriate behavior<\/strong>. Traditions in Korea were heavily influenced by China and incorporate Confucian, Buddhist, and local shamanistic beliefs and practices. The <strong>ancient Japanese<\/strong> landscape was alive and inhabited by animistic nature spirits, whose veneration forms the basis of the <strong>Shinto<\/strong> religion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Courtly and Secular Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia have rich traditions of courtly and secular art forms that employ local subjects and styles. In India, regional painting styles developed to illustrate <strong>mythical and historical subjects<\/strong>, and <strong>poetic texts<\/strong> documented court life.<\/p>\n<p>In China and Japan, a new genre of <strong>literati painting<\/strong> developed among the educated elite. Literati paintings often reveal the <strong>nonprofessional<\/strong> artist\u2019s exploration of <strong>landscape <\/strong>subjects, which are frequently juxtaposed with <strong>poetry<\/strong>. Chinese societies also developed a hierarchical and differentiated society that encouraged appropriate social behaviors that are expressed in art and architecture.<\/p>\n<p>The term \u201csecular\u201d is a bit misleading when describing Asian art, as religious ideas or content frequently are carried over into secular art forms. For example, Hindu deities depicted in Ragamala painting, associated with melodies in India. Or think of Zen Buddhist sensibilities applied to ceramic production and flower arranging in Japan.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Architecture from these regions is frequently religious in\u00a0function. <strong>Islamic architecture<\/strong> in South and Southeast Asia takes two major forms: <strong>secular <\/strong>(forts and palaces) and <strong>religious <\/strong>(mosques and tombs). Islamic mosques are decorated with nonfigural imagery, including calligraphy and vegetal forms. All mosques have a Qibla wall, which faces the direction of Mecca, home of the Kaaba. This wall is ornamented with an empty mihrab, which serves as a niche for prayer.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 192. <em>Great Stupa at Sanchi.<\/em> <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Buddhist; Maurya, late Sunga Dynasty. c. 300 B.C.E.\u2013100 C.E.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2559\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2559\" style=\"width: 946px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-2559\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Great-Stupa-at-Sanchi.jpg?resize=946%2C489&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"946\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Great-Stupa-at-Sanchi.jpg?w=472&amp;ssl=1 472w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Great-Stupa-at-Sanchi.jpg?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Great Stupa at Sanchi<br \/>\u00a9 Atlantide Phototravel\/Corbis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Learning Objective: <\/strong>Buddhist stupa<\/p>\n<p><strong>Themes: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Reliquary<br \/>\nPilgrimage<br \/>\nAppropriation<br \/>\nPassage of time<br \/>\nFunerary<br \/>\nReligion<\/p>\n<p>The<strong> <em>Great Stupa at Sanchi<\/em> <\/strong>in<strong> Madhya Pradesh, India <\/strong>is a work of<strong> stone masonry <\/strong>with<strong> sandstone on the dome. <\/strong>The initial monastic center started with the original stupa (Stupa1) + monolithic pillar built by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (reigned circa 269-232 BC) in the 3rd century BC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sanchi Stupa\u2019s outstanding importance include: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A large hemispherical dome crowned with a triple stone umbrella (chattras-Buddha stays under a chakra as royalty does) surrounded by a square railing<\/li>\n<li>Around the 1st century CE under the Shungas<\/li>\n<li>The stupa was later enlarged and encased in stone<\/li>\n<li>The four magnificently carved gateways called toranas were added at the cardinal points.<\/li>\n<li>The square posts of the entrances support three curved architraves with scrolled ends completely covered with relief sculptures<\/li>\n<li><strong>Depict Jatakas (stories of the Buddha&#8217;s earlier incarnations, Bodhisattavas), <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Scenes from the life of the historical Buddha <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Buddhist aniconic symbols. <\/strong><\/li>\n<li>A stone-paved processional path at the ground level enclosed by a balustrade and accessed through the four gateways<\/li>\n<li>A second higher terrace, also enclosed by a railing, is approached by a double staircase.<\/li>\n<li>Represents the Buddha, the path to Enlightenment, a mountain, and the universe<\/li>\n<li>Following the decline of Indian Buddhism, the site decayed; rediscovered in the 19th century<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Great Stupa at Sanchi<\/em><\/strong> acknowledges <strong>early fertility symbols<\/strong> associated with the vitality of the <strong>fruit-bearing tree.<\/strong> At each end of the ornate torahs (gates) three yakshi sculptures act as architectural brackets, supporting the sandstone beams that ran above their heads.

On the Northern gate of \u201cstupa one\u201d in Sanchi the <strong>Buddha\u2019s body is represented by the Body tree, a crowning lotus rosette <\/strong>on a column like structure, <strong>a stupa<\/strong>, the <strong>Buddha\u2019s footprints with the Wheel of the Law (dharma chakra).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Each symbol <strong>represents a pivotal event in Buddha\u2019s life:<\/strong> a lotus (or elephant holding a lotus before birth) representing his birth, a fig tree or throne representing his enlightenment that he reached after meditating under the tree, a wheel, a flaming column with a Wheel of the Law for his first teaching\/sermon (the Four Noble Truths), and a stupa (funerary mound) for his bodily demise.\u00a0 In some cases, he is also represented by a pair of footprints.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Stupa -Jataki Monkey King story &#8211; Bodhisattva<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>A depiction of the Mahakapi Jataka<\/strong> appears on the western gateway of the Great Stupa (Stupa 1) at Sanchi. \u00a0<strong>The first scene, depicted at the bottom, shows the arrival of the king of Benaras<\/strong>, mounted on a horse accompanied by soldiers. The king is shown with a parasol or chatra over his head, which signifies his royal status.<\/p>\n<p>A feature that arouses curiosity is the portrayal of <strong>musicians who accompany the king<\/strong>\u2014perhaps meant to accentuate the royal status of the king, suggesting that he travels with an entourage of attendants and musical accompaniment. <strong>To the right<\/strong> of the king an archer appears with bow and arrow aiming at the Bodhisattva <strong>(Great Monkey)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The artist(s) of the Sanchi relief shows the Bodhisattva as the bridge by which monkeys escape the king\u2019s arrows to join the rest of the troop in the forest. <strong>On the left side of the river<\/strong> (which in this relief is full of active fish and rhythmic waves of water), two men, presumably following the order of the king, appear holding a sheet below the Great Monkey as he falls.<\/p>\n<p>The episodes depicted in the Sanchi panel <strong>give no indication of order<\/strong> through either time or cause and effect. Such is the complexity of this portrayal that even a viewer well-versed in this story must closely examine the panel to \u201cread\u201d it accurately. Apparently, the artist made this for an audience with previous knowledge of the Jataka stories. There is mention of Bodhisattva instructing the king in Buddhist law before dying from the sustained wounds.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Stupas predate Buddhism<\/strong>. Before Buddha, teachers and philosophers were buried in stupas (Hindu funerary monuments). The shape was supposed to represent a person seated in meditation.<\/p>\n<p>In the 6th century BCE stupas built after Buddhism contained portions of the Buddha\u2019s ashes (not known exactly when Buddha died for sure). There were 8 stupas originally because there were 8 kings who wanted to split the remains.<\/p>\n<p>In the 3rd century BCE Great Stupa was one of the oldest and best-preserved stupas from Ashoka\u2019s reign. Ashoka was the greatest Mauryan king in India and the first ruler to associate with Buddhism in India. He converted after killing 100,000 people. When he converted, he disinterred Buddha\u2019s remains from the other stupas and distributed the remains to his new stupas.<\/p>\n<p>Ashoka built many stupas across his empire so the faithful could always access them. Ashoka chose this site because it was raised on a hill<\/p>\n<p>In the 2nd century BCE, the Sunga Dynasty in India enlarged this stupa and decorated it by adding the gates.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 193.

This pattern is known as Panchayantana in Indian doctrines. Notably, this structure reminds us of four minarets surrounding the famous mausoleum, Taj Mahal by Shah Jahan. The function served is quite contradictory in the case of this Hindu temple. As it is a Nagara-style temple, it comprises the main space called\u00a0<em>garbha griha<\/em>\u00a0or sanctum, which houses the god-statue of <strong>Lord Vaikunth Vishnu<\/strong>. It is a small, windowless, and no-contact, sacred space, where most priests are allowed to perform routine rituals.<\/p>\n<p>Vishnu is one of the main gods of the Hindu pantheon, which <strong>symbolizes preservation and protection<\/strong>. The cult of Vishnu in India is known as Vaishnavite. Mentioned in the Vedas, he is a Vedic god and thus had a large following throughout the continent of India since the ancient past. Most importantly, Vishnu is the god who regularly incarnates on the earth whenever there arises a great force of evil.<\/p>\n<p>Vishnu appeared on the earth through ten reincarnations which consist of popular gods like Rama, Krishna, Parshurama, among six others. In addition, Vishnu also appears in a variety of other divine forms, among which Vaikunth Vishnu is also a significant one. The god with three heads and four hands, is a powerful emblem of taking charge of the preservation of life and beings. The three heads represent three combined incarnations viz. Narsimha, Varaha and Saumya.<\/p>\n<p>Facing east, the\u00a0<strong>garbha griha<\/strong>\u00a0is enclosed in a tall spire structure called\u00a0<strong>vimana.<\/strong> Tapering at the top, the\u00a0<strong>vimana\u00a0<\/strong>symbolizes refinement of human senses to achieve supreme bliss and union with God. The sanctum connects to an alley called\u00a0<strong>antarala<\/strong>, which is a connecting bridge to the sacred space with a secular one.<\/p>\n<p>But how?<\/p>\n<p>The sacred space of\u00a0<strong>garbha griha<\/strong>\u00a0opens to a hall with many decorative columns, in hypostyle format, which is called\u00a0<strong>mandapa<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>There are categories to\u00a0<strong>mandapa,<\/strong> which comprise\u00a0<strong>ardhamandapa<\/strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>sabhamandapa<\/strong>,<em>\u00a0<\/em>concerning the performed activities. These activities include religious duties, chanting, singing hymns in the praise of gods and goddesses, among others.\u00a0<strong>Mandapa<\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em>is a secular space, where every layman is allowed to visit and pray.<\/p>\n<p>The interior of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong> is made with corbeled arch, a style of overlapping masonry, which is pressured on the ground for stability. This is known as <strong>Ashlar masonry<\/strong> with stones fitted using rivets instead of mortar or nails. Artists have used <strong>horror vacui<\/strong>, defining the profuse decoration on the outside walls. Significantly, the southern walls of the temple show intimate sexual poses of a male-female union.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2035\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2035\" style=\"width: 836px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-2035\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/200-D.png?resize=836%2C564&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"836\" height=\"564\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2035\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lakshmana Temple plan<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The temple sculpture in ancient India followed the aesthetics of <strong>rasa<\/strong> (acquiring relish) and\u00a0<strong>Taalmana<\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em>(proportion) to create evocative artworks. Hence, the figures are curvy, tall, slender, and extremely rhythmic. Moreover, they are lyrical, moving the gaze subtly and effectively. Artists were able to achieve this remarkable feat of precision because of <strong>sandstone, which is soft and workable<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from erotic couples called\u00a0<strong>mithuna,<\/strong> there are high reliefs of over 600 gods from Hindu pantheons. The short capitals show the form of lions, while before a devotee circumambulates the temple, the statue of Lord Ganesha assures of the correct revolving path. Significantly, in India, Lord Ganesha is worshipped by all creeds before initiating a new chapter of life. The human figurines are adorned with many accessories denoting royalness.<\/p>\n<p>The interior of the Lakshmana Temple is equally decorated with the narration of the lives of gods. Incarnations of Vishnu, Krishna Leela (tale), among many other narrative panels enliven the temple with the traditional culture of India. Based on Indian aesthetic theories, the placement of sculptures allots figures of speech (<em>alamkara<\/em>) quality. Hence, they suggest an abstract philosophy over describing it through inscriptions. The aesthetics of suggestions in Indian aesthetic theory is called\u00a0<em>dhvani<\/em>. Through love-making scenes on the temple, the importance of sex as a means to higher consciousness is emphasized by the ruling dynasty of Chandella.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Primarily, the <strong>Lakshmana Temple serves as the worshipping place of Lord Vishnu<\/strong>. The Hindu temples are deemed as a residing space for the god among the common masses. Visiting the temple, the devotee circumambulates the shrine to activate the divine energy and pay symbolic reverence and dedication. Most importantly, they should circumambulate in a clockwise direction.<\/p>\n<p>The Chandella kingdom followed the Vaishnaivite cult and to address social legitimacy, they built many temples. It also showed their piety. With respect to political agenda, they would often borrow the model of deity from the neighboring kingdom to maintain the cordial relation. In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple,<\/strong> king Yashovarman had followed the same method. However, it is stated that the present idol in the temple is not an original one.<\/p>\n<p>Rulers are depicted in tantric sex poses, which were seen as a kind of offering to the deities. The theme of the building is preservation (this is what Vishnu embodies): whether it be sexual prolonging or preservation of human life (through reproduction).<\/p>\n<p>The ancient Indian temples are solid proof of profound study, which are documented in the doctrines called\u00a0<strong>shastras.<\/strong> From the studies in the science of construction to the study of making love is practically demonstrated and celebrated in these documents.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong>, the legacy of architecture and art is combined with tantric philosophy, which presents a spiritual significance to sex. According to Tantrism, the union of the male and female body develops proximity with god.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Shilpashashtra and Kamasutra are ancient Indian texts on the art of sculpting and lovemaking, respectively. The main architect of the temple is known as Sutradhar or a Vishwakarma, a person who designs and directs the construction. Indian traditional doctrines are also replete with information to plan the building, as well as instructions to create a sculpture concerning the essential aesthetics. These structures of information have proven to be textbooks to the generation of artists in making high-relief or free-standing sculptures. Majorly, the narratives have been borrowed from ancient texts like Vedas, Puranas, and epics.<\/p>\n<p>Presenting a Vaikunth Vishnu idol in the sanctum, the Chandela kings propagated Vaisnavism. However, they also promoted Jainism and had also supported the construction of Jain temples.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Yashvoraman, a Chandella king, in 930 AD, augmented the construction of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong>, which eventually was completed during his son\u2019s rule. A guild of artists was employed to finish the massive plan of the temple. Concerning the ruler\u2019s desire to stand it out from the rest, a few changes were observed.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the <strong>Lakshmana Temple<\/strong>, the notion of sculpting erotic poses on the junctures was novel and performed for the first time. It is an example of using one of the figures of speech (<em>alamkara<\/em>) called\u00a0<em>slesha\u00a0<\/em>or pun. The temple was and is open to the visitors to seek the blessings of the preserver deity, Vishnu. It is one of the world heritage sites of India.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Lakshmana temple was constructed between 930 &#8211; 1050 CE. Yashovarman of the Chandella dynasty built many temples in Khajurao with an exemplary amount of exterior as well as interior decoration. Thus, it initiated the nomenclature of Chandela art and architecture with specific significance. Moreover, Khajurao was the capital of the kingdom that boasts many cultural sites.<\/p>\n<p>During the 10th century AD, the history of India had witnessed many falls and the rise of successful empires. Thus, the heritage was becoming predominant had followed a set of established rules.

It is an absolute artistic representation of the <strong>golden age of sculpture in India<\/strong> and made from <strong>bronze<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5><strong>Focus<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The viewer must train the eye to look beyond the mere dancing pose and try and grasp the deeper meanings of symbolic gestures and forms. Although <strong>Lord Shiva<\/strong> is shown in an effeminate dancing pose, it is a <strong>symbiotic form of male and female energy<\/strong>. With one leg lifted, knee bent, and a hand crossing over the chest, the lyrical composition brings attention to the cosmic rhythm of the universe.<\/p>\n<p>Etymologically, in Nataraja,\u00a0<em>nat\u00a0<\/em>means dance, and\u00a0<em>raja\u00a0<\/em>denotes the king. <strong><em>Narteswar<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>Natesa<\/em><\/strong> are two other names attributed to this sculpture.<\/p>\n<p>As one of the Hindu pantheon\u2019s top three gods, <strong>Lord Shiva<\/strong> is mentioned as a destroyer of the world, wherein he serves as an agent to initiate the process of new creation. That is why he is <strong>one of the most revered gods in India<\/strong>. Presenting primordial rhythm and sound, Natraja or Shiva as Lord of Dance amplifies two critical events of universal life: <strong>birth and death<\/strong>. As he performs the dance called\u00a0<strong>Tandava,<\/strong> he is annihilating the present world with utmost calm composure.<\/p>\n<p>As the most popular Indian sculpture, an emblem of worship and religiosity, <strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> <strong>symbolizes fearlessness, the defeat of evil, peace, wisdom, and immense knowledge<\/strong>. A cultural motif, different regions and timelines have depicted the Natraja in various styles, each showing a different number of hands of Shiva.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Visual Elements<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Each motif or the form in the Natraja is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.<\/p>\n<p>The arch surrounding the Shiva shows flames that originate from the mouth of the creature called <strong>Makara<\/strong>, a mythical sea creature, at the base. Thus, the encircling\u00a0<strong>nimbus represents<\/strong>\u00a0a cosmic circle of fire. This denotes the never-ending cycle of creation and destruction\u2014a cogent Hindu belief. This nimbus or halo is known as the\u00a0<em>Prabha mandala<\/em>. Interestingly, the earlier Natraja idols had an arch while later transformed into a fully circular halo. As he is ecstatically dancing, the flying locks of Shiva fan around, touching the nimbus.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>headdress<\/strong> consists of a skull, and a flower named Datura metel, denoting death as the ultimate truth and fragrance of life, respectively. Mounted with a crescent moon and the goddess <strong>Ganga<\/strong>, it indicates a peaceful state of mind despite the impending termination of life that everyone is destined to.<\/p>\n<p>According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was brought to earth from heaven by Shiva, to save the world from drought. It is a symbol of attaining higher consciousness in the face of much worldly adversity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shiva has four hands<\/strong>, which either carry some symbolic object or depict a hand pose called\u00a0<em><strong>mudra<\/strong><\/em><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upper right hand<\/strong> holds a\u00a0drum, called\u00a0<em><strong>Damaru<\/strong><\/em><u>,<\/u>which continues beating over time. Like a ticking clock, it symbolizes the primordial sound of regular and many creations and annihilations.<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>lower right-hand<\/strong> palm is raised, known as\u00a0<em><strong>abhaya\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>mudra, signifying fearlessness towards evil. The same hand has a cobra wrapped around the wrist, designating fear, danger, and turmoil. Yet, the lord is unperturbed.<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>upper left-hand<\/strong> holds <strong>agni<\/strong> (fire), an important element for the act of creation as well as destruction.<\/li>\n<li>Crossing his chest, the <strong>lower left-hand<\/strong> hides the heart of the Shiva. It is known as\u00a0<em><strong>tirodhaana<\/strong><\/em>, meaning concealment. The same hand points to the left foot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shiva possesses three eyes<\/strong>. Inclusive of the third eye on the forehead, is an inner eye that opens a vast pool of inherent knowledge and wisdom. Adorned with accessories like a bracelet and necklace, the loincloth also blows with the vigorous movement of dance, touching the halo. Shiva stands one-footed on the dwarf demon names Apasmara Purusha, which exemplifies ignorance and illusion.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, throughout all of this, Shiva continues to remain patient and peaceful, projecting the idea of control or\u00a0<em><strong>sayyam<\/strong><\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em>in the act. Hence, the sculpture is an eye opener in the chaotic world, where we tend to forget the higher purpose of life, while following a dogmatic routine.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why this was Created<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> is a cult statue dedicated to Lord Shiva, a prominent Hindu god. One of the oldest religions of India, Hinduism had been a pivotal belief in addressing the meanings of icons used in art forms. The doctrine Shilpashastra is the most important in ancient Indian literature that compulsively dominates the form, style, and composition of early Indian sculpture.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> condenses the ancient iconography of India, embodying the divine. It was created to anesthetize the laws of the universe into a narrative that can relate as well as connect to the common mass. It emulates the dancing form from the doctrine called Natyashastra, a book of theatre. Thus, it was a cult statue throughout the sub-religions of India.<\/p>\n<p>The sculpture of Shiva was first made <strong>in a dancing pose<\/strong> for temples during the 5th and 6th century CE as relief sculptures. The free-standing sculpture began to be made in the 10th century and <strong>preferably in bronze<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Around the 11th century, Nataraja statues were carried in processional parades, comprising priests and devotees. As a concept of commemoration, the Natraja idols would be <strong>covered with red and green cloth, surrounded by candles and flowers<\/strong>. The presence of the god in the statue, or deifying the idol, comes into being when a devotee worships it with immense faith.<\/p>\n<p>Indian art was based on the fundamental principles of art and aimed at evoking the inherent emotion <strong>(bhava)<\/strong> of the art piece into the audience called\u00a0<strong>rasa<\/strong>. The experience of expected <strong>rasa<\/strong> in the viewers is the marker of the successful artwork. Hence, developing an enormous reverence to the holy process of annihilation, which will inevitably become the ground of creation, Natraja follows this indoctrinated philosophy of art sincerely.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Composed in a balanced format, this bronze sculpture is from the Chola dynasty of the 10th century. The Chola artist employed the <strong>lost wax process<\/strong> or Cire perdue technique of casting. Hence<strong><em>, Natraja<\/em><\/strong> is also created with the same process. The cire perdue entails a long process of forming a wax model to prepare a core around it and pouring the molten metal either to produce a hollow or a solid cast.<\/p>\n<p>During the Chola period, bronze casting was in vogue, which is proved by a range of artifacts of a variety of Indian gods available in diverse collections. Significantly, these sculptures project stone temple carvings&#8217; style along with the iconographical features, which purports a commendable merger of technique and aesthetics. With the instruction from Shilpashastra, the\u00a0<em>talman\u00a0<\/em>or the proportion for the divine figures was preordained. The doctrine also commands how limbs should be styled, underlining Hindu ideology.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Chola dynasty served as a patron to <strong><em>Natraja<\/em><\/strong> or <strong><em>Shiva as Lord of Dance<\/em><\/strong>. Proliferating in trade and development, the Chola regions observed notable advancement in bronze casting. Moreover, the expanse of the empire extended until Srilanka in the south and other southeast Asian countries. Hence, they had enormous access to vast copper reserves, which multiplied the production of bronze sculptures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 203. <\/strong><strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanj\u00f4 Palace<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Kamakura period.

This emphasizes its <strong>violence, the skills of the samurai<\/strong>, as well as the <strong>luxury of the emperor and of his consorts. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The text usually precedes the illustration, but in this case, it frames it.

This technique was largely used in <strong>yamato-e paintings<\/strong> and creates a feeling of peeking indiscreetly.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Night Attack on the Sanj\u00f4 Palace<\/em><\/strong> uses a continuous narration technique. <strong>The action moves from right to left<\/strong> in panels that are unschooled by the narrator.<\/p>\n<p>A single ox carriage transports your eye in the whirlwind of carts and mounted warriors. The wheels of the cart are spinning, and people are trapped.<\/p>\n<p>A few characters appear more than once. Note the courtier Fushiwara and the mounted Minamoto Yoshitomo with his samurai horned helmet tied with a chin strap. The main characters are seen pushing the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa in the carriage.<\/p>\n<p>This work <strong>combines poems with drawings.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The artist uses a differentiated portraiture technique for the samurai heroes emphasizing their emotions and ruthlessness. Meanwhile the courtiers, and court ladies were depicted fugitively with stylized aristocratic dignified faces, lacking personality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<blockquote><p>Going from right to left, the hand scroll offered a cinema experience. Your eye draws imaginary diagonal lines, while following the ox cart carrying away the captured retired emperor. The use of diagonal lines emphasizes movement and disentangles the viewer from the mass of the samurai killing courtiers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The storytelling exhibits symmetry and relies on a crescendo to capture the viewer\u2019s attention. It starts with a nicely decorated single ox carriage. Following the carriage, the viewer gets entangled among colliding carts and warriors.<\/p>\n<p>The violence escalates. It culminates as the palace is engulfed by flames. Courtiers have their necks cut. Court ladies in heavy silk dresses are ambushed by arrows and chose to commit suicide by jumping in the wells.<\/p>\n<p>After kidnapping the retired emperor, the samurai flew on their horses leaving behind a disaster.\u00a0 In the end a running archer followed by a samurai led the rebels far away from the palace engulfed by flames. The samurai break free. They seem to draw energy from the violence they created.<\/p>\n<p>Without any remorse for the wreckage, the painting celebrates the samurai\u2019s swift and fatal power. It is the Minamoto clan (the victors) point of view.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>brushstrokes are refined<\/strong> while depicting the palace, the gateways, and people at the court. The <strong>brushstrokes become brisk<\/strong> for the horses and the samurai.<\/p>\n<p>The dramatic moment of <strong>the battle is captured using vivid red and green colors<\/strong>. The <strong>use of black<\/strong> for the palace focuses the viewer on its veranda event in which the emperor is forced to enter the cart.<\/p>\n<p>The painting is <strong>intended to be realistic<\/strong>. The attention to detail makes it a <strong>valuable historical reference<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>A handscroll tells a story<\/strong> section, by section as it is horizontally unrolled. <strong><em>\u00a0Night Attack on the Sanj\u00f4 Palace<\/em><\/strong> gives realistic details on the conflict between rival samurai clans.<\/p>\n<p>It was made in the 13th century to commemorate a 12th century event, glorifying the clan Minamoto and the Samurai in general.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The mounted armored archer and their war tactics seemed to illustrate the words of the Chinese tactician Sun Tzu (The Art of War):\u00a0<em>In raiding and plundering be like fire\u2026Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The facts in the painting happened in the end of the Heian period. The painting was commissioned in the Kamakura period (1185 -1333) and initiated by the Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo. During the Kamakura period the samurai were an established \u201cknightly\u201d class and Minamoto were the shogun\u2019s clan.<\/p>\n<p>The work also has documentary value on the Heiji Rebellion (1159-60). This detail-oriented painting provides precious information on the <strong>armor, head protection and weapons of the samurai<\/strong>, as well as <strong>the weaponry of other foot soldiers<\/strong>. Observe the historical references of the <strong>clothes of courtiers and court ladies.<\/strong> Also look at the <strong>architecture and decoration of royal gateways and buildings<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>hand scroll technique<\/strong> probably originated in India around 4<sup>th<\/sup> century BCE.<\/p>\n<p>Around the 6th century CE., it arrived via the Silk Road all the way to Japan together with the Buddhist religious scrolls and the Chinese writing system. It took almost two centuries for Japanese Buddhists to produce their own scrolls.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Night Attack on the Sanj\u00f4 Palace<\/strong> is a narrative painting, called <strong>e-maki<\/strong>. It combines an illustrated hand scroll, with the sequential technique of the Buddhist scrolls, and the traditional Japanese painting, yamato-e, developed alongside poetry during the Heian period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Initially e-maki depicted literary classics<\/strong> such as <em>The Tale of Genji<\/em>. In the military ruled Kamakura era, illustrated handscrolls often had a focus on \u201cwar tales\u201d like this one. The action-oriented paintings or the ones detailing historical events were preferred by men. They were called <strong>otoko\u2010e<\/strong>, or \u201cmen\u2019s paintings\u201d. An entire set was dedicated to the events of the Heiji rebellion. Another scroll tells the story of Taira recuperating the retired Emperor and one is only remnants.<\/p>\n<p>The attack on the retired emperor was insignificant, but the painting is a masterpiece of Japanese painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The audience of an emaki was reduced. It is an <strong>intimate object<\/strong> that was held in the hands of the narrator who presented the story scene by scene to a small group of listeners.<\/p>\n<p>With their exquisite calligraphy and paintings, generally done by official court painters, the <em>emaki<\/em> appealed to an educated elite, such as the imperial family, the shogun, or Buddhist monks.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The scene takes place during the Heiji Rebellion at the end of the Heian period. This was known as <strong>the period of calm and tranquility.<\/strong> This is considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court. At the end of this era the sovereignty laid with the emperor, but in fact the power was wielded by the noble clans.<\/p>\n<p>The Fujiwara and afterwards the Taira clan controlled the imperial court by marrying their daughters with the emperor and relegating the emperors to endless ceremonial functions. Japanese emperors reclaimed their power by abdicating in favor of a successor and relegating that one to conduct the ceremonies. Disputes ensued each time that the successor to the throne was chosen or an emperor retired.<\/p>\n<p>By participating in all these disputes, <strong>the samurai warrior class steadily rose and made political gains<\/strong> throughout the entire Heian period.<\/p>\n<p>In 1159, during the Heiji Rebellion the courtier Fujiwara no Nobuyori seemed the help of the samurai Minamoto no Yoshitomo to attack the palace. They started a fire and mercilessly killed courtiers and court ladies, in a bid to seize both the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa and his son from the power grip of the rival samurai clan, Taira.<\/p>\n<p>Minamoto tried to control the emperor. Another scroll continues the story by telling how the Taira managed to regain control of the Emperor. The continued rivalry between Minamoto and Taira led to the civil Genpei War, the destruction of the Taira and the establishment of the Minamoto Shogunate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 206. <em>Forbidden City<\/em>.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2043\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2043\" style=\"width: 850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2043\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/206.1.jpg?resize=850%2C564&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"564\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/206.1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/206.1.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2043\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forbidden City<br \/>\u00a9 Atlantide Phototravel\/Corbis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Ming Dynasty. 15<sup>th<\/sup> century.

Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu emperor. When Hongwu died in 1398, his first son was named next emperor. But when he died it was the first son\u2019s child who became emperor (Jianwen Emperor).<\/p>\n<p>Jianwen Emperor began executing his uncles, to remove them as threats. This angered Zhu Di who overthrew him and established himself as Yongle Emperor (Yongle means perpetual happiness). To solidify his power, the Yongle emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing and began building a new palace. He needed to show that he had the Mandate of Heaven, to display power and legitimacy and to protect himself.<\/p>\n<p>The Qing Dynasty continue to live and rule here.\u00a0 The last occupant was Puyi who was last emperor and was expelled by Chinese nationalists.

The \u201csolution\u201d was to have farmers create steel mills in their backyards. Millions died as not enough food was produced, steel mills caught fire and many other catastrophes. The plan backfires tremendously<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution of 1966<\/strong> continued for a few more years as a reaction to Mao realizing he was on the brink of losing power. Mao tried to turn frustration towards him into frustration towards the traditions of Chinese culture. Mao argued that his plan would have worked had it not been for Chinese traditions that stood in the way.<\/p>\n<p>Mao mobilized peasants <strong>(Red Army)<\/strong> and together <strong>they tortured<\/strong> traditional artists, scholars, and professors, while they <strong>destroyed <\/strong>thousands of books, historical objects, and artworks (anything Confucian or Buddhist they could get their hands on).<\/p>\n<p>Mao encouraged artists to create \u201cart for the people\u201d that would convey communist ideas in ways accessible to the masses. Realistic images of workers, soldiers, and peasants began to replace traditional ink\/silk images of landscapes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Liu Chunhua\u2019s<\/strong> image was painted in 1969 in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. Liu Chunhua was a member of the Red Guard.<\/p>\n<p>This work used socialist realism to portray Chairman Mao as a revolutionary leader committed to championing the common people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>UP NEXT:<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>South, East, and Southeast Asia<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>300 BCE\u20131980 CE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/south-east-and-southeast-asia-8-3\/\">TOPIC 8.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>South, East, and Southeast Asia 300 BCE\u20131980 CE TOPIC 8.2 Purpose and Audience in South, East, and Southeast Asian Art &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/south-east-and-southeast-asia-8-2\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">South, East and Southeast Asia 8.2<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[26],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1477"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1477"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1477\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2558,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1477\/revisions\/2558"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1477"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1477"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1477"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
