The composition is balanced, with 5 Disciples on each side of Jesus and John, who is sleeping.

Far in the background, the ark is floating on calm seas, but as the figures draw closer, the seas become more tumultuous, and several figures are shown attempting to escape death in the water by climbing to higher lands or boats.<\/p>\n<p>The landscapes are extremely bare, evidence of <strong>Michelangelo\u2019s <\/strong>disdain for painting landscapes. The tree to the left is bare, and there is no detail in the green land to the left. It appears as rocky outcrops. The figures are portrayed in a classical style, emphasizing musculature and mostly nude, but overlapping with each other in the scene.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Antiquity, it\u2019s back.<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The figural representations of the <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl<\/em><\/strong> and the Virgin Mary have similar idealistic and realistic portrayals, just like in the propagandistic representations of Caesar and Augustus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Michelangelo\u2019s Delphic Sibyl<\/strong> is a portrayal of a female seer from antiquity, one of a group who were rumored to have predicted the coming of Christ. Prophets and Sibyls are portrayed sitting on thrones, alternating male and female figures around the perimeter, all of whom prophesied the birth of Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>It is notable that the <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl<\/em><\/strong> is a representation of the voice of Apollo, a Greek god. This Gentile representation symbolized that Jesus\u2019s birth was not only for the Jewish people, but for all people in the world. The <strong>colors of her clothing, yellow, blue, white, and orange<\/strong>, are <strong>symbolic of<\/strong> the basic elements of life: <strong>earth, water, air, and fire<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Classical and Christian traditions are joined, as was common in High Renaissance works, but no perspective or emotional lighting is used. Michelangelo&#8217;s interest in the human body coincides here with humanist rhetoric and sermons given in the Sistine Chapel at the time, which exhorted both God and the created universe as worthy objects of praise.<\/p>\n<p>Both <strong>Delphic Sibyl and the Flood<\/strong> are stark contrasts to Leonardo\u2019s <em>Virgin of the Rocks<\/em>, in which there is a rich landscape and rocks. The figures are presented in a pyramidal grouping. Chiaroscuro reveals the figures, while the background is dark and mysterious. Leonardo employs atmospheric perspective to give the illusion of depth. The peacefulness of the scene in <em>Virgin of the Rocks<\/em> is very similar to the peacefulness portrayed in <strong><em>Delphic Sibyl<\/em><\/strong>, while it is in stark contrast to the chaos that occurs in the Flood.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2497\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Delphic-Sibyl.jpg?resize=761%2C596&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"761\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Delphic-Sibyl.jpg?w=761&amp;ssl=1 761w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Delphic-Sibyl.jpg?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Delphic Sibyl<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2499\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas.jpg?resize=638%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas-scaled.jpg?resize=638%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 638w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas-scaled.jpg?resize=187%2C300&amp;ssl=1 187w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1234&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas-scaled.jpg?resize=956%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 956w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas-scaled.jpg?resize=1275%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1275w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Virgin-of-the-Rocks.-Leonardo-da-Vinci.-Milan-Italy.-ca.-1483-C.E.-Oil-on-canvas-scaled.jpg?w=1594&amp;ssl=1 1594w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Virgin of the Rock<\/em>s.

He bears the trademark broken nose and buckskin boots of Raphael\u2019s rival, Michelangelo. When the scaffolding in the Sistine Chapel was temporarily taken down in 1510 C.E. and Raphael saw Michelangelo\u2019s frescoes, he added his portrait to the School of Athens in Michelangelo\u2019s own monumental style.<\/p>\n<p>Raphael was known for his ability to imitate the styles of other artists, and this witty out-Michelangelo-ing of Michelangelo has been equally interpreted by scholars as an attempt at flattery and as a painterly thumb to the nose.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Mannerism\u2014Not as Polite as You Thought<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The works of <strong>High Renaissance artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci<\/strong> served as a point of departure for the next generation of artists, the Mannerists, or Mannerism. <strong>Mannerists rebelled against the current cultural concept and idealistic classical portrayal and opted to present works as stylized, or mannered.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mannerist works are stylized to appear exaggerated or distorted<\/strong> in comparison to the balanced works of the Renaissance. Such stylizations are interpreted as refined or developed formal elements undertaken for the sake of beauty or refinement itself. They have been related to the sophistication of European courts or seen as a reflection of the religious and social tensions and controversies of the period. Mannerists rebelled against the current cultural concept and distorted classical portrayal.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Entombment of Christ<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Florentine artist Jacopo da Pontormo was one of the first Mannerists<\/strong>, whose work <strong><em>Entombment of Christ<\/em><\/strong> encapsulated spatial and anatomical distortions to create a weirdly visionary depiction.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Entombment of Christ<\/em><\/strong> works as part of a larger ensemble of images in the Capponi Chapel in the Church of Santa Felicita in Florence and is a depiction of Christ&#8217;s burial. Christ is the limp form to the left, carried by his grief-stricken followers to his tomb. Women comfort the Virgin Mary, in blue, who watches her son helplessly, her right arm reaching for him.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Entombment of Christ<\/em><\/strong> uses the characteristic <strong>Mannerist color palette of wild blue and pink<\/strong>, which stand in contrast to both the Renaissance color palatte of reds, golds, browns, and greens and the tortured expressions of the participants in the narrative.<\/p>\n<p>The scene is a departure from previous depictions of the Entombment. The faces appear not only sorrowful at the events taking place but also psychologically unbalanced. Olive-green shadows create the eerie lighting of the scene.<\/p>\n<p>The spatial setting and structure of the image are unclear, with some figures appearing to float. Mary&#8217;s garments envelop her like a cloud of fabric. The two bearers of Christ strike poses that are ungainly, highlighting both the strangeness of the scene and the painter&#8217;s facility in the handling of anatomy.<\/p>\n<p>The overall composition of the work circulates around the center of the canvas instead of a clear, rational focal point.<\/p>\n<p>The painting goes beyond the requirements of the Entombment narrative to include the painter&#8217;s own distinctive vision. The expression-filled faces, the garish coloring, the contorted figures, the disproportionate anatomy, and the lack of symmetry are all marks of Mannerist art. As compared to Italian Renaissance art, there is a lack of perspective and realism. Mannerists rejected Classicism&#8217;s perfect proportions as soulless, choosing instead to warp reality in search of emotional depth.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-727\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/78-Entombment-of-Christ.jpg?resize=690%2C1066&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Entombment of Christ \u00a9 De Agostini Picture Library\/The Bridgeman Art Library\" width=\"690\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/78-Entombment-of-Christ.jpg?w=213&amp;ssl=1 213w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/78-Entombment-of-Christ.jpg?resize=194%2C300&amp;ssl=1 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mannerism i<\/strong>s a distinct departure from previous styles.

The Florentines prided themselves on rational design, spatial construction, and on the \u201cintellectual\u201d nature of their art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Colorito<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Colorito refers to the Venetian penchant for <strong>subtle distinctions of color and light<\/strong>. Venetian paintings were often characterized as works of subtle poetic beauty, appealing to the eye and the senses.<\/p>\n<p>The Venetian painter Tiziano Vecellio, commonly referred to as <strong>Titian, produced lyrical and poetic secular works, which he described as poesie or favole, poems or fables<\/strong>, often for patrons outside Venice. Titian preferred subjects of beautiful women and love in the mythological contexts that interested him.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-518\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?resize=876%2C614&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/80-Venus-of-Urbino.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Venus of Urbino<\/em>. Titian. c. 1538 C.E. Oil on canvas.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Titian&#8217;s <strong><em>Venus of Urbino<\/em><\/strong> is set in a palace, emphasizing the subject&#8217;s wealth and decorum. Though the typical Venetian sky can be glimpsed through the background window, the painting is situated in the intimate indoor setting of the bedroom. <strong>Titian <\/strong>was innovative to place a Classical nude in this setting. This is a modern Italian setting, and Titian synthesized Classical and contemporary subjects, which had never been done before.<\/p>\n<p>The woman gazes timidly at the viewer. Roses, traditionally symbols of true love and unabashed sexuality, drop softly from the bouquet in her right hand. <strong>Titian<\/strong> draws on the Knidos Aphrodite from Greek sculpture, but his Venus is devoid of the attributes the Classical goddess, such as humility; instead, she is unashamedly erotic.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Speculation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Speculation over whom Venus represents is dominant. <strong>Titian<\/strong> sometimes employed <strong>courtesans <\/strong>as models. The <strong>pair of marriage chests in the background and the dog<\/strong> at the end of the bed<strong>, symbolizing faithfulness, emphasize the position of the woman as a wife.<\/strong> However, the dog is asleep, possibly signifying infidelity. As the goddess of fertility as well as love, Venus was often painted in reclining images on the inner lids of marriage chests.<\/p>\n<p>Though the painting was first owned by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, <strong>duke of Urbino<\/strong>, it is unknown if he commissioned the work or if it was originally intended to be connected to a wedding. Though it is not clear that the woman is supposed to be a portrait of the goddess Venus, brides as far back as antiquity had been linked to the goddess in terms of their shared traits of beauty, sexuality, and fertility. This enables the woman to be a Venus, though she may not be a depiction of the goddess.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Now, Back to Colorito and Disegno\u2026<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Venetian art was characterized by <strong>colorito<\/strong>, which had <strong>feminine connotations in contrast to the hard, analytical, and masculine style exemplified by the disegno.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was appropriate to paint the beauty of a woman in a soft, feminine style, linked to pleasure, emotion, and sensuality. This sums up the quality of Titian\u2019s work as a dual seduction of the viewer through both subject matter and style. This became the model of the reclining nude for later works like <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque <\/em><\/strong>and<strong><em> Olympia.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1495\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/107-Le-Grande-Odalisque.jpg?resize=425%2C239&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/107-Le-Grande-Odalisque.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/107-Le-Grande-Odalisque.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1542\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/115-Olympia.jpg?resize=439%2C298&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/115-Olympia.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/115-Olympia.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Mexica Redux<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Cultural changes extended beyond Europe during the Renaissance.
