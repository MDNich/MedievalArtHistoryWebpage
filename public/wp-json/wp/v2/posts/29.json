Some of these were the first fired <strong>ceramics<\/strong> and <strong>painting<\/strong>, as well as <strong>incised graphic designs<\/strong>, primarily on rock surfaces. <strong>Sculpture<\/strong> featured female forms and animal figurines. <strong>Architecture <\/strong>included stone megalithic installations.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The First Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Beginning approximately 77,000 years ago, the first \u201cart\u201d was created in the form of rock paintings and carved natural materials.\u00a0 These were <strong>two-dimensional<\/strong> creations of <strong>geometric patterns<\/strong> and <strong>human and animal<\/strong> lifeforms. <strong>Three-dimensional<\/strong> forms included <strong>sculpture, large scale objects, and monuments<\/strong>. Environments were assembled and\/or constructed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>West, Central and South East Asian Communities<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Humans established Paleolithic communities in West, Central, South East Asia, and East Asia between 70,000 and 40, 000 BCE.\u00a0 In prehistoric China, the ritual of making <strong>jade objects<\/strong>, started a 5000-year tradition of working with this precious medium.\u00a0 The semi-precious stone is soft but durable. These works had a spiritual symbolism, as they were often buried with the people who owned them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ritual, tomb, and memorializing arts<\/strong> are found across Neolithic Asia, including impressive funerary steles from Saudi Arabia and Yemen.<\/p>\n<p>Asia\u2019s greatest contribution to early world art is in <strong>ceramic<\/strong> technology, with some of the earliest pieces dating to 10,500 BCE produced by the Jomon culture in Japan. \u00a0Even earlier pottery continues to be found, particularly in China. Ceramics were also produced in Iran beginning in the eighth millennium BCE, and refined vessel forms arose from the adoption of the potter\u2019s wheel in the fourth millennium BCE.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Migration from Asia<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>In the Pacific region, migrations from Asia, approximately\u00a0 45,000 years ago, were possible because of lowered sea levels and the existence of land bridges. The earliest created objects have been dated to about 8000 years ago. The Lapita peoples, who moved eastward from Melanesia to Polynesia beginning about 4000 years ago, created pottery with incised geometric designs that appear across the region in multiple media today.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Statements<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe\u2019s artistic statements were made in small <strong>human figural sculptures<\/strong> (central Europe), <strong>cave paintings<\/strong> (France and Spain), and <strong>outdoor-monumental stone assemblages<\/strong> (British Isles). These provide glimpses into the beginnings of ritual life in 15,000 BCE.<\/p>\n<p>People tried to influence and integrate with the natural cycles of the cosmos and promote both\u00a0 human and animal fertility. These works establish the dynamic interplay of naturalism and abstraction found throughout art\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>American Continent Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>On the American continent, from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego, indigenous peoples who had recently migrated from Asia, before 10,000 BCE, made <strong>sculptural works, with animals and sacred humans<\/strong>, as main subject matter.\u00a0 These were made from <strong>animal bone<\/strong> and later from <strong>clay.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Similar to European- expressions, ancient American art adapts animal images to the natural contours of the chosen materials and also features fertile females. Many <strong>female figurines<\/strong> may also display unusual or supernatural characteristics. This\u00a0 suggests the importance of shamanic religion, brought from Asia, very early in human history.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 1.75rem;\">(1) 3.<em> Camelid sacrum<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Prehistoric American (Mexico). 14,000 \u2013 7000 BCE.

Archaeologists have unearthed supreme examples of congs, created by the Liangzhu people, in royal tombs, palaces, and workshops.\u00a0 Due to its varied colors and textures,\u00a0 jade is the material most highly prized throughout Chinese history.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is a Cong?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A cong is a tubular object with a circular hole cut into it in the middle like a cross section.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>At each corner of the Jade cong, there is a face patterned, with circular eyes and a slit-like mouth. These images could be deities or ancestral spirits. \u00a0\u00a0The faces are rather abstract, but suggestive indicating a man-like figure or a personified beast.<\/p>\n<p>The viewer focuses on the cylindrical void circular shape within the prism. The visual effect creates equilibrium. It is achieved by the symmetry of the corner face carvings, the concentric circles pattern, the perfect\u00a0balance given by its equal top and base,\u00a0by the rather uniform whitish jade color and its polished smoothness.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of this artwork might be Individual and Society because the congs were a status symbol for the deceased. It could also represent Knowledge and Belief due to the symbolism of the carved faces. It might also have as sub-theme of Life Cycles because the height of the cong might measure the generations of the clan and it might be the predecessor of the ancestral tablet.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What was the Function of a Cong?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Congs had funeral functions, but what specifically is not known. Congs were placed in the tombs of the wealthy and sometimes they were the only artifact placed there. Surely this means it was an important piece.<\/p>\n<p>One existing theory is that it represented details about the clan.\u00a0 The layers of the cong could have signified the age and number of generations of the clan.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, a tall cong would mean an old clan, while a short one would be a new clan. More congs in a grave, might mean the deceased was the head of more than one clan. The cong might be the predecessor of the ancestral tablet. This was placed in the ancestral temple, representing thus the spirit of the ancestors and a cosmic pillar connecting earth and heavens.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Background<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The cong belongs to the <strong>Neolithic Period<\/strong> 2500 B.C.E Liangzhu culture, Jiangsu province of China, located south of the Yangzi River. The Liangzhu culture was characterized by a series of prosperous city-states, cultivated rice, and domesticated pigs. With a stable food supply the society could afford the high specialization of its jade carvers.<\/p>\n<p>The Liangzhu society was hierarchal as the jade congs could only be found in elite tombs. The periods of relative calm between floodings must have been long because the cong is a large piece of jade. Jade\u2019s particularity is that it can only be sanded out. It cannot be simply cut. It must be polished, so the artisans needed time and resources to produce it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The cong associates jade with divinity and power.<\/strong> \u00a0This association continued until the late Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) during which a deity was called the Jade Emperor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(1)6. <\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><strong>Anthropomorphic stele<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Prehistoric Middle Eastern. 4,000 BCE.
