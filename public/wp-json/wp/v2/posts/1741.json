The two walls point towards either the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument. Where the walls meet, they are 10.1 feet high. Each wall slopes at the ends to less than a foot and is covered with <strong>text only<\/strong>. There are <strong>no images<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The work was inspired by <strong>Minimalism<\/strong>. This art movement that begins in the 1960s in the US, aims to eliminate all non-essentials in an artwork by reducing it to its most simple geometric elements. It goes further than Cubism.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Lin had to create a way to <strong>commemorate loss<\/strong> without designing a memorial that would tell people what to think about Vietnam. It needed to be approachable and apolitical, with a focus on work being a place of mourning and healing.<\/p>\n<p>The design does not aim to resolve conflicting emotions about the validity of the war. Instead, it is meant to be a space for catharsis, mourning and contemplation.<\/p>\n<p>The viewer must engage with the work close up to interact with it. The reflection of the loved one\u2019s name is a powerful reminder of their sacrifice for the country.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>sunken placement<\/strong> was meant to evoke <strong>a spiritual journey<\/strong> for the viewer.

She was still a student at Yale\u2019s School of Architecture. The work was made for a public design competition. Her professor had assigned this as a project for his students. (Meanwhile, she only received a B+ grade on it from the professor!)<\/p>\n<p>Her design was one of over 2,573 submissions, in response to a call for entries by the US government.<\/p>\n<p>The idea came from the Yale Memorial Rotunda. Alumni who had been killed in war have their names inscribed on the walls. She used to touch the names and feel contemplative.<\/p>\n<p>She did not do any specific research on the war because she felt politics had eclipsed the veterans. She wanted the focus to remain on the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>The Vietnam War was a disaster on all counts. Most Americans believed the war was a moral tragedy. All of America knew it had been lost. Most opposed to the war did not blame the soldiers but the government, although some did attack soldiers or disrespect them upon their return. The vets were angry with the lack of respect and distraught about the great loss.<\/p>\n<p>The average age of names on the wall is 19.<\/p>\n<p>Life expectancy for a US soldier upon putting their boots on the ground in Vietnam was 1 month.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Vast Criticism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Lin was resoundingly <strong>criticized for this work.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>black color <\/strong>was said to not match with the rest of the US Mall. It was called \u201cblack gash on Mall\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>People interpreted the color black as a symbol of shame and dishonor over the war. Lin meant it as a sign of mourning. Additionally, black was seen as a color in Asian art, and was not typical in American, Western, or classical art&#8211;that color would have been white.<\/p>\n<p>The work was considered <strong>nonrepresentational and not traditional<\/strong>.\u00a0 It lacked ornamentation and did not follow traditional funerary sculpture. Many thought the design was too simple and did not depict honor and sacrifice in a traditional way.<\/p>\n<p>War veterans wanted a traditional and realistic sculpture. One is added off to the side to assuage concerns.<\/p>\n<p>People wondered why a young Asian American woman from an Ivy League college who did not know the realities of war was the artist. Why would she be picked to design a monument about deaths in an Asian war?<\/p>\n<p>Building permits were refused. It took a 4 Star Brigadier General to testify before subcommittee hearings and defend the color before the project moved forward.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Maya Lin<\/strong><em> said, \u201cIt took me 9 months to ask the VVMF, in charge of building the memorial, if my race was an issue. It had never occurred to me that it would be, and I think they had taken all the measures they could to shield me from comments about a \u201cgook\u201d designing the memorial. I remember reading the article that appeared in The Washington Post referring to \u201cAn Asian Memorial for an Asian War\u201d and I knew we were in trouble.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>She continued by saying<em>, \u201cThe controversy exploded in Washington after that. Ironically, one side attacked the design for being \u201ctoo Asian,\u201d while others saw its simplicity and understatement, not as an intention to create a more Eastern, meditative space, but as a minimalist statement which they interpreted as being non-referential and disconnected from human experience. This left the opinion in many that the piece emanated from a series of intellectualized aesthetic decisions, which automatically pitted artist against veterans. The fact that I was from an Ivy League college and had hair down to my knees further fueled this distrust of the design and suspicions of a hippie college liberal or aesthetic elitist forcing her art and commentary upon them.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>(10) 227. <em>Summer Trees<\/em>.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Song Su-nam.

The colors of <strong>red, blue, yellowish gold are prominent<\/strong>. The upper body is in a triangular composition. The size, lighting, color, and composition are all supposed to be similar to Old Master paintings. The size is equal to a Grand Manner\/history painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>From the <strong>\u201cHistory Portraits\u201d<\/strong> series \u2013 the artist draws inspiration from the history of art. Each work is <strong>based on an Old Master<\/strong> masterpiece showing her in it. She portrays a feminist hero. Many of her photographs show stereotypes of women or traditionally strong women.<\/p>\n<p>Judith has traditionally been viewed as strong, but alternatively dangerous and sexual.<\/p>\n<p>She <strong>blends aspects of painting with photography<\/strong>. By creating a photograph modeled after a painting, she becomes a prop even though we assume photography is truthful. We are supposed to realize photography is as much a construct as painting was.<\/p>\n<p>When critiquing the photography, we cannot avoid the fact it can be heavily manipulated. But it also argues for the legitimacy of photography as artistic. If photography can replicate a painting, then photography must have some merits and must be like painting.<\/p>\n<p>This work depicts as reality something that was originally a painting. It presents painting via photography. \u00a0Photography cannot be inherently trusted even though this is generally our attitude. (Think magazines and social media).<\/p>\n<p>What Cindy Sherman is really doing is what Daguerre tried to do. That is to illustrate that photography can replicate painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What We See<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This replicates <strong>the story of Judith and Holofernes<\/strong>. Judith was a heroine in the bible who slayed the Assyrian general, Holofernes. She got him drunk, seduced him, and then beheaded him.<\/p>\n<p>The artist depicts herself in costume, standing in front of textiles in the background This was typical of Baroque art. <strong>Sherman<\/strong> wears Renaissance-era fashion, consisting of a red-satin dress, with an empire waistline, cinched by a dark blue sash. In her hand is the head (mask) of Holofernes, who is old and wrinkled. In the other hand, she holds a bloody knife.<\/p>\n<p>She stares forward with a blank expression, with a heavily made-up face. Her eyebrows are thin, and her lips are painted red.<\/p>\n<p>Her bare feet point outward and are out of proportion. This might be a reference to early Renaissance difficulties with foreshortening.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Feminist Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Feminist art aims to look back through the canon of art history and draws attention to women through women\u2019s stories, female subjects, and female artists. Popular subjects are the same as during the Renaissance and Baroque period, which were popular stories of strong Biblical women.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Book of Judith<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The book of Judith from the Old Testament recounts the story of Judith. To save her people from the Assyrian king, she seduced her way into the tent of the general Holofernes. She then got him drunk and beheaded him.

When she was \u201cfreed,\u201d she began to learn about ceremonial paintings and began working in batiks (dyed cloths) first, as well as ceremonial sand paintings.<\/p>\n<p>One of her works was selected for the cover of an exhibition catalog.

It occupies a 37-foot-wide corner of a gallery. Colors are projected on a wall full of black silhouettes made of paper. These were deliberately made to be reminiscent of the Victorian era, which was the era of slavery.<\/p>\n<p>Silhouettes were an inexpensive alternative to painted photographic portraits. Traditionally, they were a bust profile, cut out, affixed to a non-black background, and framed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The viewer is forced to become a part of the scene.

We will never know all of their stories.<\/p>\n<p>Notice how quickly we recognize our stereotypes. We cannot see what race these figures actually are, and yet based upon their stereotypical features, we project information upon them. This work uses stereotypes to challenge how comfortable and recognizable they are.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work depicts a scene from the pre-Civil War South.

Each one is essentially individual and unique.<\/p>\n<p>The artist worked with 1600 artisans in Jingdzhen, the city known as the \u201cPorcelain Capital\u201d where Chinese artists produced pottery for 2,000 years. <strong><em>Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds) <\/em><\/strong>provided employment for people in this city, while Ai Weiwei oversaw the production.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is this work Post-Modern?<\/strong> This is a global artist, with a new art object, representing social critique, with a revival of tradition.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The work is a critique on political and economic injustice. There is a sense of the small, tiny parts that make up the whole. Though each is incredibly small, they create a feeling of vastness.<\/p>\n<p>Here there is a comparison between the individual vs. the group. The individual seed is lost among the millions. The critique of conformity and censorship is inherent in modern China. People who are unique must be the ones to cause change.<\/p>\n<p>The artists used traditions of the past (traditional ceramic art) to critique Mao and communist history.<\/p>\n<p>Mao tried to destroy traditional Chinese traditions and art. He failed.<\/p>\n<p>People could touch, lay, walk on, and interact with the work. The viewer became a part of the experience. Initially, this was allowed but about a week into the exhibition, they realized this was crushing the seeds and the ceramic dust was toxic.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>100 million individual sunflower seeds weighing 150 tons<\/li>\n<li>Each sunflower seed is porcelain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why sunflower seeds?<\/strong> Sunflower seeds evoke Mao\u2019s Communist propaganda (Mao was rendered as the sun and the citizens were sunflowers, turning their faces to Mao. Seeds show the promise of something that can grow and become. Seeds make plants self-perpetuating, but these seeds cannot grow anything.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Porcelain<\/strong> is a symbol of imperial culture in China. It was an important way that the West began to be exposed to Chinese art. The use of porcelain also comments on the long history of this prized material while also cleverly still being \u201cMade in China\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In the Cultural Revolution, Mao tried to destroy these traditions by destroying Chinese art. In 2011, Ai Weiwei was arrested for three months. He was released due to pressure from the art world. On his blog, he investigated the cover-ups and corruption in the government\u2019s handling of a 2008 earthquake in China, as well as the country\u2019s hosting of the Olympics.<\/p>\n<p>The Chinese Cultural Revolution led to Ai Weiwei\u2019s father, an esteemed poet in China, being sent to a communist labor camp. Before he died, Ai Weiwei\u2019s father gave his son permission to speak out about Mao\u2019s injustices and conformity in China. Ai Weiwei is following a Confucian tenet&#8211;respect for elders.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>UP NEXT:\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Global Contemporary<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1980 CE to Present<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/global-contemporary-10-3\/\">TOPIC 10.3 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Global Contemporary Art<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Global Contemporary 1980 CE to Present TOPIC 10.2 Purpose and Audience in Global Contemporary Art Diverse art forms are considered &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/global-contemporary-10-2\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Global Contemporary 10.2<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,23],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1741"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1741"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1741\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2820,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1741\/revisions\/2820"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1741"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1741"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1741"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
