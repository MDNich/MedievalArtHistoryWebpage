The <strong>people worship their ancestors<\/strong>. The people do not die but can be communicated with. There is also <strong>a great deal of respect for elders.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Spirit worship<\/strong> is key. It is thought that spirits can control fertility of both humans and of land.<\/p>\n<p>There is an interpretation of African art, culture, and history as primitive. \u00a0This often stemmed from European interpretations that privileged realism and science over stylization and ancestral\/shamanistic religions.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations <\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Art was not only intended to be decorative but was supposed to serve a ceremonial purpose.<\/li>\n<li>Artists generally used <strong>wood, ivory, and metal<\/strong>, as these were common natural resources surrounding these African tribes.<\/li>\n<li>Artists worked with workshops and were trained in this manner.<\/li>\n<li>There are often no written histories.

Sometimes these works were multimedia such as jewelry.<\/p>\n<p>The work is often made from wood.

Below is the backgrounder the museum gives on the work:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>At palace festivals, the king and chiefs of Benin wear pairs of long, cylindrical bracelets made of ivory or brass decorated with images that symbolize royal power. On this example, images of mudfish and Portuguese heads&#8211;both referring to the king&#8217;s divine nature and his association with Olokun&#8211;alternate checkerboard style around the bracelet. Bracelets were among the few ivory objects available to chiefs and not strictly monopolized by the king.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5>Architecture<\/h5>\n<p>Architecture is generally made of <strong>mudbrick, and sometimes stone<\/strong>. Rain presents challenges and buildings need constant maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>A requirement in African are buildings that remain cool inside.

The community was based on farming, livestock, mining, and trade. The ruling elite appear to have controlled wealth through the management of cattle which was the cornerstone of the Zimbabwean economy. By 1500, their influence waned though historians are not sure why.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Archaeological evidence has revealed glass beads and porcelain from China and Persia, as well as gold and Arab coins. This illustrates the extent of the long-distance trade that Zimbabwe participated in with the outside world.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In \u00a0the 1800s, English colonizers found Great Zimbabwe and were stunned by the grandeur and workmanship. It was concluded that Muslims must have constructed this (even though there is no evidence of Muslims in this area).

It fell from the sky and landed in his lap! This was considered a miracle and interpreted as the gods choosing Osei Tutu to unite all the other kings in the area. He not only replaced all existing chieftains but also eliminated all other objects related to political authority. This stool was the only one.<\/p>\n<p>This created the <strong>Ashanti<\/strong> nation.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Land of Gold<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Ashanti kingdom in Ghana is an area rich in gold. The textile color gold and gold itself is reserved for royal use. This kingdom headed up the gold trade with Europeans in North Africa.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The British Invasion<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In 1874, the British destroyed the Ashanti capital in an attempt to colonize the Gold Coast. The British \u00a0also wanted possession of the <strong>Golden Stool<\/strong>. This war was aptly named <strong>the War of the Golden Stool<\/strong> (1900).<\/p>\n<p>The King was exiled. The king\u2019s mother (Queen Mother) encouraged people to fight against the British. Of course, the stool was hidden, and the British were unable to find it.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, it was a British victory. Ashanti became a colony but was allowed to retain a ceremonial king and the stool came out of hiding.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1417\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Flag_of_Ashanti.svg_-1.png?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Stools are iconic now in the Ashanti kingdom and even appear on their flag.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(<\/strong><strong>6) 171. <em>Ndop. <\/em>(portrait figure) of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Kuba peoples from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 1760-1780 CE.

It must disguise the entire body so that a vengeful spirit does not take her. The mask sits on top of the head.\u00a0 It represents ideal female spirits and qualities.

There are small eye slits to look out of. The <strong>mouth<\/strong> is small indicating she does not gossip. The <strong>ears<\/strong> are small too indicating she does not listen to idle gossip. The <strong>forehead <\/strong>is high to illustrate a sharp mind. <strong>Hair<\/strong> indicates health and purity, while the <strong>intricate hairstyle<\/strong> represents a close tie with the women in the community.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>rings around the neck<\/strong> have some significance. The prominent rolls at the back of the neck shows that the figure has enough body fat to give birth to healthy children. These rings could also symbolize concentric waves from which the Sowei breaks through the surface.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>color<\/strong> black symbolized water, coolness, humanity, mystery.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>In Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Mende People are an ethnic group of mostly agriculturalists. They are divided into two groups of those who have been initiated and those who haven\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Initiation rites<\/strong> for girls in the Sande Society involved being removed from their everyday lives and taken to a secluded place in the forest. The act of going to the jungle symbolized secrecy and fertility. Seclusion could last several weeks to several months<\/p>\n<p>While in the forest, girls were anointed with white clay and animal fat to make themselves dry, pasty, unattractive. Girls were taught how to be good wives and good mothers. They were instructed in domestic skills, sex, farming, dancing, medicine by the women of the Sande Society.<\/p>\n<p>While secluded, <strong>the main ritual girls<\/strong> underwent is <strong>female genital mutilation <\/strong>were the labia and clitoris were removed. This was supposed to increase fertility. It was also thought to instill proper sexual behavior which was considered that sex should not be pleasurable for the woman, rather it was a duty. It was thought to make a young woman clean, test her strength and foreshadow the pain of childbirth. It was also considered a bondage experience between the girls, who had all gone through the same pain and healing process.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the ceremony, their white clay is ritually washed off their body. The young women emerge with a new name and new clothing.<\/p>\n<p>The community has been reluctant to share details of ceremony with scholars, particularly Western scholars.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(6) 176. <em>Ikenga <\/em>(shrine figure).\u00a0 <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Igbo peoples from Nigeria. 19<sup>th<\/sup> to 20<sup>th<\/sup> century.
