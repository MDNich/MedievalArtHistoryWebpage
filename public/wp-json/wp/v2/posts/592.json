The Petrine theory established that Christ bestowed keys upon Peter. Therefore, popes were spiritual descendants of Peter.<\/p>\n<p>There was papal power over state power, with the threat is excommunication.<\/p>\n<p>During the <strong>11<sup>th<\/sup>-12<sup>th<\/sup> centuries<\/strong> there was\u00a0 an explosion of <strong>construction.<\/strong>\u00a0 Many of these churches were destroyed by Germanic invasions and wars.<\/p>\n<p>Raoul Glaber, a monk of the period noted, &#8220;It was as though the world had shaken herself and cast off her rags, wishing to clothe herself in a beautiful white robe of churches.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>The<\/strong><strong> pilgrimage movement<\/strong> began during this time. Shrines were established along the roads, as well as inns. Pilgrims were practicing the act of contrition or searching for a cure for illness.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Artistic Innovations: Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The word <strong>\u201cRomanesque\u201d<\/strong> was coined by 19<sup>th<\/sup>-century art historians, who noticed the structures built entirely of stone, were a Roman revival of sorts. The revitalization of large-scale architecture was caused by pilgrimages across Europe. Patrons were the Church and the wealthy, elite.<\/p>\n<p>Churches took hundreds of years to build and were extremely expensive. Master builders watched over the build of the architecture.<\/p>\n<p>There was a <strong>fear of the buildings burning down<\/strong>. This resulted in stone roof tops. Theses heavy structures put strain on the foundation. Solid, thick round arches were used.\u00a0 To keep the full support network, windows could not be cut out. This kept churches dark.<\/p>\n<p>Church design were <strong>altered to accommodate pilgrims<\/strong> coming in to look at relics. The goal be able to allow church goers to enjoy the services without disruption.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the innovations at this time included <strong>rib vault, bay,<\/strong> and <strong>ambulatory<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-593\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Romaneque-Architecture.jpg?resize=700%2C525&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Romaneque-Architecture.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Romaneque-Architecture.jpg?w=425&amp;ssl=1 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-594\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Romaneque-Arch.jpg?resize=500%2C513&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The painting of manuscripts continued.

Four main pilgrimage routes developed from locations in France, all converging on Santiago de Compostela.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Crusades (1095\u20131271 C.E.)<\/strong> defined the era. Pope Urban II was greatly angered that the Christian shrines of the Holy Land were under Muslim control and, therefore, inhibited pilgrimages to these sites.<\/p>\n<p>In a speech given in 1095 C.E., he preached the need to wage a &#8220;Holy War&#8221; and reclaim control of Jerusalem. With the First Crusade, Christians claimed control of Jerusalem. Before the last Crusades were over, however, Muslim general Saladin marshaled command over Jerusalem again.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Anatomy of a Church<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Churches sprang up along these pilgrimage routes, often boasting their own relics. Most churches used new masonry vaulting techniques, including the use of stone and wood, and employed a distinct floor plan in which apse areas housed relics. These relics defined their function as a pilgrimage destination.<\/p>\n<p>The basic form of the pilgrimage church originated from the early Christian Basilica, Romanesque masons elaborated on this model with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>heavy, masonry ceilings<\/li>\n<li>rounded arches<\/li>\n<li>architectural sculpture in the tympanums<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The plan for the <strong>Basilica of St. Sernin in Toulouse, France<\/strong>, is typical of pilgrimage churches of the Romanesque period. The square of the church&#8217;s crossing served as the geometric basis for the rest of its precisely constructed plan. The nave bays were half the size of the crossing square, and the bays in the aisles were one quarter of a square.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>St. Sernin Plan<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2389\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/St.-Sernin-Plan.jpg?resize=700%2C406&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"406\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Plan of St. Sernin. ca. 1070\u20131120, Toulouse, France<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Nave<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2390\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2390\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2390\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Nave.jpg?resize=500%2C291&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"291\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2390\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nave<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The nave in the pilgrimage church plan was lengthened to accommodate more pilgrims.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0Side Aisle<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2391\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2391\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2391\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Side-Aisle.jpg?resize=500%2C289&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2391\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Side Aisle<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The side aisles were doubled, with an additional outer aisle adding for easier movement of large groups of people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Crossing<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2392\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2392\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2392\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Crosiing.jpg?resize=500%2C289&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crossing<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The crossing marks the intersection between the nave and the transept.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Transept<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2393\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2393\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2393\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/transept.jpg?resize=500%2C292&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"292\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2393\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transept<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The transverse section of the church plan perpendicular to the nave.

These monks, based at Cluny, France, became a major cultural, spiritual, and economic power.<\/p>\n<p>The Cluniacs built <strong>Cluny III<\/strong>, an enormous and elaborately decorated Romanesque central abbey church in Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, France.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Cluniacs\u2019 believed a <strong>lavishly decorated<\/strong> church was appropriate for communicating Christian doctrine and glorifying God.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cluny III Abbey<\/strong>, a pilgrimage church, <strong>was built three times<\/strong>, each on the same location and an expansion of the previous structure. Alfonso VI, the King of Spain, gave 10,000 talents and enough money to cover half the cost of the Cluny III construction project. Much of the structure was torn down during the French Revolution, the <strong>bell and clock towers were the only original elements that remained<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>With the reintroduction of heavy masonry ceilings, Romanesque architects increasingly found ways to lighten structures and allow more light into the interior. <strong>Cluny III<\/strong> was the first church to build full-scale double transepts in the chevet, incorporate pointed arches, and the C\u00f3rdoban horseshoe lobes on arches.<\/p>\n<p>This <strong>Moorish influence was due to an influx of Spanish artisans from Alfonso VI&#8217;s court<\/strong>. The use of the <strong>pointed arch in the nave is rare in Romanesque architecture but dominant in Gothic architecture<\/strong>. These innovations allow for less stone and increased windows to allow more light in the interior.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>All About the Architectural Sculpture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Architectural sculpture is a hallmark of the <strong>Romanesque era<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Modena Cathedral<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Few sculptors&#8217; names from either the medieval or the Romanesque period are known with certainty.

The portal sculpture displays the crowned King of All Kings in hierarchical scale; Christ is larger and more intense than the other figures. Each figure&#8217;s size and location connote their relative importance.<\/p>\n<p>For example, twisting in figure eights around Christ are the four beasts of the Apocalypse, waiting under his direction to be unleashed.

It enabled pilgrims to move in an out of the church by moving them around the service and behind the alter.<\/p>\n<p>The bonus of this floor plan is that it resembles a cross.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Romanesque Characteristics<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Church of Sainte-Foy <\/strong>has taller arches. To keep these arches and walls upright, the walls had to be made very thick to pinch the arch upwards. To keep the structures of the wall intact, windows were eliminated.

She became a martyr when she was killed by the Romans by refusing to worship pagan gods. She was only 12 years old.<\/p>\n<p>Her skull became the relic that pilgrims wanted to visit.

This was the final destination of all pilgrims because it contains the relic of St. James.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Relics as Religious Objects<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Relics are <strong>objects of religious significance<\/strong>. Some Christian examples directly associated with Christ\u2019s life include, the manger, the cross and Mary\u2019s clothing. Then, there are physical remains of saints such as teeth, feet, or skulls. Additionally, anything the saint may have touched was also considered a relic, like clothing or a bible.<\/p>\n<p>It was <strong>believed that relics induced miracles<\/strong>. They could cure sickness, sop famine or plagues. This created a commerce market for relics. Forgeries abounded. So many people were selling pieces of the True Cross, that John Calvin famously remarked that you could build a ship with them.<\/p>\n<p>Reliquaries developed as ways to protect and display relics. Since relics were valuable , they were enshrined in containers that were decorated with precious metals and precious and semi precious stones.<\/p>\n<p>Churches were <strong>built along major pilgrimage roads<\/strong> to welcome pilgrims and show them relics\u2014both real and forged. <strong>Relics<\/strong> became a <strong>source of income for the church<\/strong>, as people made offerings. It also helped <strong>support the town<\/strong> in was the church was in <strong>with tourism trade<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Today, every October, there is still a festival in Conques and the region of Southern France that celebrates Sainte Foy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 59. <em>Bayeux <\/em><em>Tapestry<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Romanesque Europe (English or Norman). 1066-1080 CE.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-513\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-513\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/59-Bayeux-Tapestry-Calvery-Attack.jpg?resize=700%2C435&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"435\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cavalry attack<br \/>\u00a9 Erich Lessing\/Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Learning Objective:<\/strong> Romanesque embroidery<\/p>\n<p><strong>Themes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>War<br \/>\nRulers<br \/>\nPropaganda<br \/>\nText and image<br \/>\nViolence<br \/>\nPower<br \/>\nVictory<br \/>\nTextiles<\/p>\n<p><strong>Museum:<\/strong> Bayeux Museum.
