There were 76 entrances or <strong>vomitoria<\/strong> that encircled the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>The seating was determined by status. The emperor had his own private box.\u00a0 On the first level sat senators, magistrates, vestal virgins and wealthy women. The second level was reserved for knights and generals. The third and fourth level were for the middle class. The fifth level held women and the poor.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Concrete Construction<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Built with concrete technology, this led to new shapes, such as curved walls. The concrete was made with lime mortar, volcanic sand, and water that was mixed together. It was then placed in wooden frames to dry.<\/p>\n<p>To make sure concrete pieces stay firmly attached to one another, instead of using mortar, Romans used lead and bronze pins, like a skeleton that held multiple blocks together. Concrete formed the core but the outside was covered with travertine.<\/p>\n<p>Romans believed that concrete was effective and practical but ugly. Concrete was cheaper than importing tufa or Greek marble. Also general labourers, or in this case Roman slaves could work in the construction and not specialists.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Arches<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Romans were masters at building arches and the Colessum masters the arch. The arches were built with a wooden frames underneath that could be removed. Each stone has to be wedge-shaped or smaller at bottom than on top. If this was achieved correctly, mortar was not needed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?resize=500%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?w=845&amp;ssl=1 845w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Colosseum-Drawing-2.jpg?resize=768%2C581&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A<strong> voussoir<\/strong> is individual stones of an arch.

Geographically, the site is located 150 miles south of both Amman, the capital of Jordan and Jerusalem.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Background History<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Nabatean people had settled in southern Jordan by 312 BCE.\u00a0 Ideally placed at the Northern end of the Caravan Route that ran from South Arabia to the Mediterranean, the people were great traders during the late Hellenistic and Early Roman Periods. The commerce of luxury products such as frankincense and myrrh, that was burned at alters, as well as spice, contributed to a wealthy society.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Romans <\/strong>invaded during 106 CE and changed the name to Arabia Petrae. Here, they ruled for 250 years, until an earthquake destroyed the buildings. The <strong>Byzantines <\/strong>would take control later and govern for another 300 years. Petra was mostly abandoned however, by the eight century CE.<\/p>\n<p>Referred to as the Rose City, because of the color the stone appears, Petra was named a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site<\/strong>, in 1985.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Initially, historians thought Petra was a large necropolis or cemetery. The architecture proves otherwise, uncovering what was once an active and well-developed metropolis.<\/p>\n<p>With talented architects the community transformed the rocky desert into a great city through innovative constructions. Engineers turned the dusty land into a garden oasis by using an elaborate water system through damming, terracing, and irrigation. This was used to harvest, store and distribute water collected during the rainy season.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Treasury Fa\u00e7ade<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_380\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-380\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-380\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Petra-Tresaury-1.jpg?resize=500%2C601&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"601\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Treasury<br \/>\u00a9 Bernard Gagnon<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The most famous building is the Treasury (or Khazneh).

This is because of the political and cultural changes regarding Christianity\u2019s validity.<\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>medallion<\/strong> or circle, the portrait of Christ as Good Shepherd, is a pastoral motif going back to the Greek Calf Bearer. The symbolism is that Christ will rescue individual sinners who stray from his flock, just like a shepherd does for sheep.\u00a0 Notice the cross design of the ceiling, which is domed like the Dome of Heaven.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who was Priscilla?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>These catacombs are built underneath a villa, once owned by a wealthy woman named Priscilla. This is how she decided to help sponsor the poor, as only the upper class could afford the cubicula and buy sarcophagi.<\/p>\n<p>In 313 CE, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which not only forbid Christian persecution, but tolerated Christianity within the Roman empire. Until the sanction of the state, Christians remained hidden in small numbers. The religion attracted the poor, with a promise of a better afterlife. Since rich and poor were judged on equal terms Priscilla and other wealthy Christians, believe that the poor deserved a proper burial.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The First Examples of Christian Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Why did Christianity exist for 200 years without artistic production? There are many theories. Some think that it may not have survived. Others think the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> commandment prohibited it.<\/p>\n<p>Still another theory is that they did want their religion to be new, which focused on monotheism, not to replicate the Greco-Roman traditions that focused on polytheism and nudity.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 49.
