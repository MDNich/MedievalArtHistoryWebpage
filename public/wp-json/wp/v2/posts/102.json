The shared artistic forms, functions, and techniques. \u00a0These works were often influenced by both earlier and contemporary cultures. This is evident in places of worship.

The cultural shift that took place during the Renaissance in Europe led artists to explore secular subjects in addition to religious works, such as scenes from everyday life like Bruegel\u2019s <em>Hunters in the Snow <\/em>or Ruysch\u2019s <em>Fruit and Insects.<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art through the Centuries<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The arts of <strong>15th-century<\/strong> Europe reflected an interest in classical models, enhanced naturalism, Christianity, pageantry, and increasingly formalized artistic training. ***See detail 15<sup>th<\/sup>-century art pages.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>16th-century<\/strong> Protestant Reformation and subsequent Catholic Counter-Reformation compelled a divergence between western European art in the north and south with respect to form, function, and content.

Until the sanction of the state, Christians remained hidden in small numbers. The religion attracted the poor, with a promise of a better afterlife. Since rich and poor were judged on equal terms Priscilla and other wealthy Christians, believe that the poor deserved a proper burial.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The First Examples of Christian Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Why did Christianity exist for 200 years without artistic production?

This style of architecture was developed in the Ile de France area around Paris, that was ruled by the King of France.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pointed arches<\/strong> were created by moving rounded Roman arches upward. This enables the stress lines to move inward towards the ground, not out diagonally. With taller arches, the roof of the buildings could be raised creating <strong>taller ceilings<\/strong>. This resulted in a need for light. <strong>Stained glass<\/strong> became prevalent in Gothic architecture. It allowed not only sunshine through but provided a highly decorative feature.<\/p>\n<p>These raised elements caused less weight on the structures, resulting in <strong>thinner walls<\/strong>.

This church burned to the ground in 1194. The tunic \u00a0was believed to be lost!<\/p>\n<p>Then, three days later, the tunic was discovered unharmed in the crypt below the church. This was seen as a true miracle! The interpretation of this event was that Mary wanted to get rid of the old Romanesque style church, so that a Gothic church could be built for her tunic. A new Gothic church was constructed from 1194 \u2013 1220, but the old Romanesque fa\u00e7ade remained.<\/p>\n<p>The Gothic era was a hard time to live through. Diseases spread. Wars prevailed. Interest in Mary developed, as Mary became the figure you could appeal to, and she would intercede on your behalf.

Artist <strong>Giotto di Bondone<\/strong>, designed the interior space so complementary to the exterior, that many believe he may have also been the architect of the <strong>42 feet tall<\/strong> structure.<\/p>\n<p>Unadorned, and <strong>made of brick<\/strong> on the exterior, and vastly decorative on the inside, it utilizes the old Christian symbolism of beautiful interior (soul) and austere exterior (body).<\/p>\n<p>The simple basilica planned as an AKA rectangular barrel-vaulted hall.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Painting Frescoes<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>A buon fresco,<\/strong> or a wet or true fresco, starts with an application of wet plaster onto a wall. The wet plaster is then painted with <strong>tempera<\/strong> paint, made with egg yolk and pigment. This method \u00a0enables the paint to soak into the plaster, rather than just painting it and letting it dry on top of the wall. This makes the work durable, but speed is important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Giornata, <\/strong>in Italian is an art term meaning<strong> \u201ca day\u2019s work\u201d<\/strong>. When creating a <strong>buon fresco, <\/strong>an artist must complete it in a day.

He wanted to atone for his sins of charging interest on a loan or the act of usury. Dante, in his novel, <strong><em>Divine Comedy<\/em><\/strong> even singles out the Scrovegni family for this sin.<\/p>\n<p>It was named <strong>Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel<\/strong>, because it was right by an old Roman area, which was part of the Scrovegni estate.\u00a0 This kind of art was known as <strong>good work<\/strong> to help the patron earn his way into heaven.\u00a0 Enrico Scrovegni himself appears in the Last Judgement fresco on the side of the blessed.<\/p>\n<p>The chapel was <strong>intended for the private use<\/strong> of the Scrovegni family.

It is a group scene of the event, unlike the Pieta, which was just Mary and Christ. A range of emotions are displayed: sadness, resignation, outbursts, and despair.<\/p>\n<p>Here, Mary holds Christ in a manner similar to other Mary and Christ Child scenes or Nativity scenes. She raises her right knee to prop Christ up. She puts her arm around him and leans towards him.<\/p>\n<p>The diagonal cliff formation points the eye to the main action placed in the lower-left hand corner. Christ is no longer center, no longer heraldic, no longer hierarchical. This is a departure from Medieval tradition.<\/p>\n<p>Mary Magdalene sits at Christ\u2019s feet, and her long, red curly hair, references how she had earlier cleaned Christ\u2019s feet, with oil and her hair. John the Evangelist stands behind her. He is the youngest disciple and always depicted beardless.<\/p>\n<p>The angels are in grief, pulling on their hair. While the figures at the back encircle the action. They do not provide information to the narrative but are a visual to the entrance of the painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is Typology?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Typology<\/strong> is the study and interpretation of stories and symbols in the Bible, especially the relationship between\u00a0 the Old and New Testaments. Here is how this is used in <em>Lamentation<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The land is baren except for a single dead tree. This is the Tree of Life, which withered at the fall of Adam.\u00a0 Christ is often thought of as the second Adam. This also gives reference to Winter and Christ\u2019s death, before Spring and the eventual resolution.<\/p>\n<p>In the quatrefoil to the left, Jonah is being swallowed by a whale, from the Old Testament story.\u00a0 Jonah is often seen as a typological precursor to Christ.\u00a0 He suffered a \u201cdeath\u201d in the belly of the whale for three days. Then he was spit out. This was seen as a resurrection.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Giotto di Bondone (1276- 1377)<\/strong> is considered the first artist of the Renaissance because he departs from the Gothic style and begins to place three-dimensional solid figures in a real and logical space. Art historians speculate that he was trained by Florentine painter, Cimabue, because their styles were so similar.<\/p>\n<p>Born just outside of Florence, he would paint chapels in not only Florence, but Assisi, Rome, Padua, and Naples. He is regarded as the most important Italian painter in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 64. <em>Golden Haggadah. <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Late medieval Spain (Jewish). 1320 CE.

Each hour on the hours a lioness would produce water out of her mouth, as a representation of a clock keeping time.<\/p>\n<p>The fountain utilized a complex hydraulics system, using two water channels that formed a cross in the center of the courtyard. The fountain apparently baffled all who saw it, even inspiring a poem about it by Ibn Zamrak.<\/p>\n<p>Although, not designed with anatomical accuracy, it was intended to show strength and power. Historians speculate that the four to the two water channels is associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The water flowing through suggests giving life. Although the 12 lions represent the 12 hours on a clock, they could also represent the 12 signs of the zodiac.<\/p>\n<h5>SUB-IMAGE 2 (<strong>Hall of Two Sisters<\/strong>)<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_452\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-452\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-452\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/65-Alhambra-Hall-of-Sisters.jpg?resize=500%2C690&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"690\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/65-Alhambra-Hall-of-Sisters.jpg?w=271&amp;ssl=1 271w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/65-Alhambra-Hall-of-Sisters.jpg?resize=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-452\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hall of the Sisters<br \/>\u00a9 Raffaello Bencini\/The Bridgeman Art Library<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This hall was in the center of a series of rooms where the sultana and her family lived.

Mary is still unaware of the angel\u2019s presence. She is seated on the floor, indicating that she is humble. Above her are beamed ceiling. There is a second story to this home showing great wealth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Disguised Symbolism in the Center Panel<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Towels and water are a symbol of cleanliness. Think baptism, Mary\u2019s cleanliness and purity, and Jewish prayer cloth.<\/li>\n<li>Flowers are white lilies, called the Madonna Lilies, symbolizing Mary\u2019s purity.<\/li>\n<li>Three buds are a symbol of the Trinity.<\/li>\n<li>Unopened bud, opened bud, dying bud.<\/li>\n<li>Mary holds the bible in a cloth, like her body holding the Christ child\/piety.<\/li>\n<li>Scroll and book on table symbolize the Old and New Testament with a supremacy of New vs Old.<\/li>\n<li>Lion finials on the benches symbolizes the king of animals like Christ is king of men.<\/li>\n<li>There are 16 sides to the table, reference to 16 main Hebrew prophets.<\/li>\n<li>The table is supposed to be an altar. Angel Gabriel wears the clothing of a deacon.<\/li>\n<li>Mary blocks the entrance of fireplace, commonly thought of as the way the devil enters.<\/li>\n<li>Folds of Mary\u2019s cloth form a star. Mary was queen of Heaven.<\/li>\n<li>A candlestick. The flame is typically symbol of God\u2019s presence. A candle going out is foreshadowing Christ\u2019s crucifixion.<\/li>\n<li>The sun shines through the oculus window bringing a cross. Christ enters with out breaking glass as in the divine conception.<\/li>\n<li>Christ heads straight towards the white lilies symbolized Mary\u2019s purity.<\/li>\n<li>Christ heads toward her ear. This symbolizes the word of God, spoken by Angel Gabriel, that was heard by Mary was the way she became pregnant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Right Panel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Joseph in his carpentry workshop. The cult of St. Joseph was becoming increasingly popular, as he was loving father and head of holy family. The mousetrap is a common symbol of capturing the devil.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Left Panel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The left panel is the <strong>donor panel<\/strong>. It shows the patrons kneeling before the holy scene, with a messenger in the background. The messenger is carrying an important letter to the family.<\/p>\n<p>The donor is believed to be Engelbrecht of Mechelen, a burgher, or city councilman.\u00a0\u00a0 The status and piety of both he and his wife is evident.<\/p>\n<p>The wife is wearing a dress with an excess of fabric in the sleeves. This is fashionable, but not necessary, showing a sign of wealth. She holds prayer beads and looks down in humility. He takes his hat off as a sign of respect.<\/p>\n<p>The couple are witnessing the Annunciations. The viewer is expected to think these two people are pious enough to bear witness to this important religious event.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What was the Function of the<\/strong> <strong><em>Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece)<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>This piece was commissioned as a private piece that could be portable. The altarpiece was meant to encourage piety. Given it is an Annunciation scene, this was likely meant to parallel this couple\u2019s own hopes for a child.<\/p>\n<p>The work was also a sign of status. The new middle class wanted to buy art to decorate their homes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Background Story<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This altarpiece was executed in phases. It is thought that the central panel was probably not commissioned. Artists often created them, know that they would sell.<\/p>\n<p>The male donor, Engelbrecht of Mechelen ordered the wings. After getting married Engelbrecht\u2019s wife and the messenger were added in.<\/p>\n<p>The windows of the central panel were originally gold, but were then painted with a blue sky and the shields were added.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 71<em>.

Lippi is known for his delicate swirls of transparent fabric, with an emphasis on lines and curves. He uses <strong>chiaroscuro <\/strong>the gradual contrast between light and dark to show roundness and a sense of volume.<\/p>\n<p>The landscape uses <strong>atmospheric perspective<\/strong> and shows the natural blurring of blue-gray tones that occurs when our eye moves back into space.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Who Commissioned This Work?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Lippi\u2019s major patrons were the wealthy Medici banking family, yet no one knows for sure if they commissioned it. Historians know that it was used to guide worship and prayer, and as a sign the display the piety of the owner.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Human Side of Religion<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The scene was a popular type in the Italian Renaissance, as it helped to humanize religion. It reminds the viewer that Mary was a normal mother and Christ her beloved son.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mary\u2019s hands are devoutly clasped in prayer. Her youth and beauty are evident, with her hair elegantly embellished with pearls and a veil. There is just a glint of a halo. Yet, she seems a little sombre and Christians believed this was her foreshadowing about what would happen to her son.<\/p>\n<p>Playful, childlike angels stand around. Christ appears like a naturalistic, normal baby. Gone are the Gothic like depictions of him as an old-man baby.<\/p>\n<p>The backdrop is a seashore, with rocks and land indicating the safe haven of the church. The city is meant to be Heavenly Jerusalem. Mary was referred to as the \u201cport of salvation\u201d.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Renaissance Philosophies<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>During the Renaissance, the classics were revived along with the three classical philosophies<strong>: Idealism, Humanism, Rationalism<\/strong>. All three are depicted in this work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Idealism:<\/strong> Mary is depicted in her idealized youth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Humanism:<\/strong> Mary and Christ are depicted as in a family portrait.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rationalism:<\/strong> Mary and Christ are calm. They do not exhibit emotion and are restrained.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of the Painter<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Fra Filippo Lippi<\/strong>, although a monk, had a seedy side to his nature. Vasari, the first art historian and 16<sup>th<\/sup> century Renaissance painter, wrote about Lippi in his book <em>Lives of Artists<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>It is said that Fra Filippo was so lustful that, he would give anything to enjoy a woman he wanted it he thought he could have his way. If he couldn\u2019t buy what he wanted, then he would cool his passion by painting her portrait.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>His lust was so violent that when it took hold of him, he could never concentrate on his work. Because of this, when he was doing something for Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, his main patron, Cosimo had to have Lippi locked in so he wouldn\u2019t wander off.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>One time, after Lippi had been confined for a few days, Fra Filippo\u2019s amorous, or rather animal, instincts, drove him one night to seize a pair of scissors, make a rope from his own bedsheets and escape through a window to pursue his pleasures for days on end!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Vasari continues he story by saying that at a certain point Cosimo just had to give in and learn to treat the painter with respect. The prevailing attitude was that art was created by a skilled worker. Cosimo learned that the artist had to be inspired to create.<\/p>\n<p>And Lippi continued to be inspired. He painted an alter piece for the nuns of St Margherita in Prato.<\/p>\n<p>There, he saw a beautiful nun named Lucrezia Buti. He abducted Lucrezia and kept her in his house, despite the nuns\u2019 attempts to get her back.<\/p>\n<p>Lucrezia inspired the images of his female figures, with her pale alabaster soft skin and strawberry blonde hair. The image of Mary in <strong><em>Madonna and Child with Two Angels<\/em><\/strong> is based on her.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Fra Filippo Lippi<\/strong> (1406-1496) was born in Florence. In 1420, he was registered to the Community of Carmelite friars of the Carmine in Florence. He took his vows at age 16. The prior noting that the teen loved to draw in his notebooks, allowed him to learn to paint.\u00a0 Soon after, the budding artist tried to quit the order, but the request was denied. He was appointed to work for a convent and then a rectory.<\/p>\n<p>He continued to paint, but it is rumored that the money he received was spent on women. It is also rumored that Lucrezia Buti bore him a son. The son was named Fillippino Lippi. While he too would become a famous painter, who his mother may have been was never certain.<\/p>\n<p>Filippo Lippi died while working on the frescos in the asp of Spoleto Cathedral. Fillippino completed his father\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 72.<\/strong> <strong><em>Birth<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>of<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>Venus<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Sandro Botticelli.

It is based on the classical sculptures of Venus. The Medici family owned the sculpture <em>Modest Venus<\/em>, so the artist was able to study it. Fine modelling or <strong>chiaroscuro<\/strong> and the white flesh color add to the sculptural appearance of Venus. The <strong>contrapposto<\/strong> positioning adds to the grace.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look at the <em>Birth of Venus<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>The classical subject matter shows Venus, the goddess of love, being born, as a fully formed woman and physically perfect.\u00a0 Hesiod, a classical poet, said Venus was conceived when Chronos castrated his father, Uranus, whose severed organs fertilized the sea foam.<\/p>\n<p>The goddess is depicted on a shell, the sign of Venus. Pink roses are scattered before her. The classics say roses were created at same time as Venus, indicating love is beautiful, but can be painful.<\/p>\n<p>Venus is then blown towards the shore of Cyprus, by Zephyrus, the god of the wind. His cheeks are puffed out. Entwined around him is a nymph, either Chloris or Aura. At the shores waits Flora, the goddess of Spring or a handmaiden.<\/p>\n<p>Venus has a faraway look in her eyes, as if not bothered by mortal concerns. She exhibits Renaissance philosophies<strong>: Idealism, Humanism, Rationalism<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Classical with a Twist <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Botticelli\u2019s Venus is based on the Modest Venus pose that was particularly popular in the classical Greek era. This pose involves Venus covering up her breasts and hips.<\/p>\n<p>Botticelli would have seen these sculptures through his patrons, the Medici family, who owned a number of classical sculptures of Venus.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being based on classical sculptures of Venus, Botticelli\u2019s version has unusual dimensions. She has elongated portions in her neck, left arm, and torso.<\/p>\n<p>Her serpentine pose is gravitationally impossible. The figures around her float, without anchor to the ground. In fact, they do not give of shadows.<\/p>\n<p>The landscape is flat. The waves are v shaped. There is a great <strong>emphasis on pattern<\/strong>, from the flowers free floating in the air to the left, to the flowered fabric to the right. The seashell gives a patterned look of light and dark stripes. This reminds the viewer that it is a <strong>two-dimensional work.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Botticelli uses the technique of pushing figures forward onto a parallel plane to the picture plane, with a background behind them. This is based on ancient Greek vase painting where figures are isolated from the background.<\/p>\n<p>The artist emphasizes <strong>a graceful curving linearity<\/strong>, rather than a calm rational sense of space. Notice the delicate, twisting, curling lines.<\/p>\n<p>Botticelli mixed expensive <strong>alabaster powder<\/strong> into the pigment to make the colors brighter. The artist also added exquisite <strong>gold leaf<\/strong> into Venus\u2019 hair.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Canvas Versus Wood<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The <strong><em>Birth of Venus<\/em><\/strong> is one of the first paintings ever to be <strong>painted on canvas<\/strong>. Using canvas was cheaper than wood, which allowed for much larger paintings. Canvas also withstands humidity well. Whereas wood can warp. The one drawback was that canvas was considered informal, so it was only used for non-official works. Yet, the mediums used to create this work are of a superior quality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>No documentation associated with the painting has been found. Vasari does mention this as a\u00a0Medici painting in his book. It was painted for Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, the powerful head of the Medici clan, at the time. Historians think that the inspiration for Venice was Lorenzo\u2019s mistress Simonetta Cattaneo. She was also the mistress of his brother Giulio de\u2019 Medici!<\/p>\n<p>Both Lorenzo and Botticelli were interested in the revival of ancient myths. This work was unusual at the time, because not only is the almost life-sized and nude, she is not portrayed in a biblical context. Some scholars think it was placed in a bedroom, due to its sexual nature.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Christian Interpretation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>After Savonarola\u2019s death, when a new level of religiosity spread through Florence, a Christian interpretation of this painting emerged. This made the work more acceptable at the time. Some ideas included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nudity of Venus echoes that of Eve in Garden of Eden.<\/li>\n<li>Venus was interpreted as a personification of the Church.<\/li>\n<li>One of Mary\u2019s nicknames is \u201cstella maris\u201d \u2013 star of the sea.<\/li>\n<li>The sea gives birth to Venus just as Mary gives birth to Christ.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Philosophy Based on Platonism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Platonism was a popular philosophy in Renaissance times. It stated that the contemplation of physical beauty enabled the human mind to comprehend spiritual beauty. It justified the serious study of classical nudity, or any nudity, to understand God\u2019s capacity to create beauty and perfection. Historians consider this an excuse to study nude women.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Short Artist Biography<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Sandro Botticelli was a student of Lippi, who was credited for much of what the artist learned. Botticelli was considered innovative for depicting female nudity in a secular, or non-Christian way. In fact, the <strong><em>Birth of Venus<\/em><\/strong> was the first non-religious nude, male, or female, to be depicted since classical antiquity. Even Donatello\u2019s <em>David <\/em>was a nude biblical figure! Botticelli\u2019s work would lead to the tradition of depicting female nudes in art history.<\/p>\n<p>Botticelli later felt guilty about the work he created. <strong>Fra Savonarola<\/strong>, a famous friar denounced art, nudity, classicism, sexuality and what he perceived to be the excesses and corruption of the Medici family and Florentines as a whole. The friar\u2019s followers took part <strong>Bonfire of the Vanities<\/strong> in 1497, where artwork and books were burned. The <strong><em>Birth of Venus<\/em><\/strong> survived.<\/p>\n<p>Botticelli was so influenced by Savonarola\u2019s sermons that he suffered a nervous breakdown. As a result, he became deeply religious. Eventually he abandoned fine art painting altogether.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 75.

It was not until the ceilings were cleaned, in the last 20 years, that the work of Michelangelo was revealed. Full, vibrant colors, for a new generation to marvel at!<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Creating the Ceiling Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The artist used a series of complex scaffolding to stand on and paint the ceiling. Before he started to paint, the curved ceiling was a flat blue color, with some decorative stars.<\/p>\n<p>Michelangelo painted the figures first in <strong>grisailles<\/strong>, or grays, to get modeling and shadow correct. Then, color was painted over top.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the other techniques the artist used include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trompe l\u2019oeil<\/strong> architecture: French for \u201ctricking the eye\u201d with anything that is illusionistic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quaddro Riportato<\/strong>: \u201ccarried picture\u201d that allows a fresco to be seen straight on, in a space parallel to the floor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Why was the Sistine Chapel Built?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>Sistine Chapel<\/strong> was built to show the power and \u00a0legitimacy of the Church and Pope, through extravagance and scope.

Her massive form is a basic triangle, in that she widens towards the hips. Circular forms create the scroll, knees, and cloak. While the space she sits in is rigid, her body is round.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Enhancing the Female Form<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Female forms were based off the muscularity of men. Her arms are extremely powerful. Even so, she has a grace and gentleness. In the style of the day, ennobling the female forms made the figures appear stronger and greater.<\/p>\n<p>It was considered inappropriate to sketch a female nude at the time. Male nudes were often substituted. In this case Michelangelo used cadavers to achieve the correct musculature.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Delphic Sibyl <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The word\u00a0Sibyl\u00a0was first mentioned by the ancient Greek writer Heraclitus in 500 BC. It was not just Old Testament figures who foretold the coming of Christ. One of the most famous Delphic Sibyls predicted the falling of Troy.<\/p>\n<p>The position of Sibyl was filled by many different women over the years. There were no social or economic criteria for the role, but she had to be wise, in her 40s or 50s, and understand the role of the gods.\u00a0 On the seventh day of every month, she sat at the Delphic temple on a big rock, with ivy growing on it. Here, she would make prophecies.<\/p>\n<p>Her blue head scarf\u00a0 acted as a crown or diadem to show her legitimacy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><em>Creation of Adam<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This narrative has been paired down to essentials. God is in sky and Adam is bound to earth.\u00a0 The figures possess a sculptural quality of both strength and grace. In fact, the depiction of Adam is influenced by the classical sculpture Belvedere Torso. Adam is heroically nude and an ideal beauty. This connects him to the divine.<\/p>\n<p>God and angels sit on a shape like the brain. This indicates that being human is the capacity to think.

Pope brought the master of ceremonies in to watch Michelangelo, even though the artist insisted he did not want anyone to watch him. The master of ceremonies complained that there were too many nudes.<\/p>\n<p>Michelangelo painted this between 1534-1541. By then, the style had changed from High Renaissance to Mannerism . This focused on distortion, with a jumbled composition, and was a reaction against High Renaissance order and harmony.<\/p>\n<p>The work shows the Last Judgment, where Christ returns to Earth in his second coming and judges mankind. On the left, \u00a0those who have sinned are separated from the blessed, who will go to heaven, on the right.\u00a0 On the lower right is Minos, with a serpent wrapped around his chest.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of the Sistine Chapel<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Sistine Chapel<\/strong> was erected, in 1483, under Sixtus IV, hence the name. The Catholic Church was trying to maintain authority, during Protestant rumblings, corruption and extravagance.<\/p>\n<p>Michelangelo began to work on the frescoes for Pope Julius II in 1508. He asked the artist to paint a ceiling with geometric designs and place the 12 disciples in the spandrels. Michelangelo proposed this instead.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Michelangelo<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Michelangelo (1475-1564)<\/strong> was born in Caprese, Republic of Florence, in Italy.\u00a0 He was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect, and poet and considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>He trained with painter Ghirlandaio, once his father realized his son had zero interest in school and would therefore never take over the family\u2019s financial business. The boy would first learn the techniques of fresco and draftsmanship.<\/p>\n<p>After one year, he moved into the palace of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the Medici clan. Here the artist studied classical sculpture with Bertoldo di Giovanni.<\/p>\n<p>In 1446, he arrived in Rome, at the age of 21. As they say, the rest was history!<\/p>\n<p>The artist will forever be associated with the Italian Renaissance.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 78. <em>Entombment of Christ <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Jacopo da Pontormo.

They hired artist Jacopo da Pontormo, known as <strong>Pontormo. <\/strong>He created the large alter painting <strong><em>Entombment of Christ<\/em><\/strong>, measuring <strong>10 feet by 6 feet and 4 inches. <\/strong>It is a work created using<strong> oil on wood.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>What are the characteristics of Mannerism?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mannerism took on a departure from the balanced, harmonious, stable composition of the Renaissance.

The work was visible to the public entering the church, yet it was blocked off to them. This shows the wealth and power of the Capponi family it was named for.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>A Confusing Narrative<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Mannerist quality is intentionally confusing, unlike the clarity and precision of the Renaissance. In this case the viewer is unsure of the narrative. If this is the deposition, where is the cross and the ladder? If this is the pieta, why is there a crowd around? If this is the entombment, where is the tomb?<\/p>\n<p>The Virgin Mary falls way from the viewer towards the back after she releases her dead son\u2019s hand.<\/p>\n<p>Christ is pale. The viewer can see stigmata. He appears to be of generous weight and yet his body is supported without effort. The two figures holding Christ have been interpreted as angels who, unaffected by the weight of Christ\u2019s body, are lifting him towards God.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>From High Renaissance to Mannerism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>High Renaissance was from 1495- 1527, in Rome. Three major events happened during this time:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1517:<\/strong> Martin Luther\u2019s 95 Theses<\/p>\n<p><strong>1520<\/strong>: Raphael dies from a fever at age 37 \u00a0school is upturned.<\/p>\n<p>The Renaissance was a time of great perfection in art. Where would artists go now to learn from a great master now? Yet, some of the greatest Mannerist painters that were yet to emerge had trained in Raphael\u2019s workshop.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1527:<\/strong> Sack of Rome by the mutinous troops of HRE Charles V.<\/p>\n<p>Mannerism was a response to the chaos and frustration of the historical events by rejecting perfection in art. Once Mannerism emerged, the word was considered a derogatory term, meaning artists could only paint in a \u201cmanner\u201d not in a style. Later, it was these works were created for sophisticated courtiers and royalty.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Jacopo da Pontormo<\/strong> (1494-1557) was born as <strong>Jacopo Carrucci<\/strong>, in the Republic of Florence. (Italy) He was known for breaking away from the High Renaissance classicism into his more personal style of Mannerism.\u00a0 As the son of painter Bartolommeo Carrucci, Pontormo apprenticed to Leonardo da Vince and later Mariotto Albertinelli and Piero di Cosimo.<\/p>\n<h4><strong><em>(3) 79.

In fact, the early pieces, before 1504 , did not contain his name at all.\u00a0 From 1504 to 1506, he entwined his initials \u201cLC\u201d. Then, up until 1509, he signed works with his initials separated. Leading up to 1914, he added three initial and a winged serpent, which was he coat of arms. In 1515, he dropped his initial altogether and just used the coat of arms.

This allows also for the fa\u00e7ade to move towards us and away from us.

There are no side aisles, no radiating chapels, and no transept.\u00a0 <strong>Chapels<\/strong> run along the side, but you cannot walk through these. Aisles were removed to allow space for traffic. This provides worshippers with a wide uncluttered space, unified under the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>The altar is the focus. The transept does not extend beyond the nave. There is a semicircular apse, with stairs that spill out.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Il Ges\u00f9 <\/em><\/strong><em>was the <\/em>Mother church of the Jesuit order.

They outlawed <strong>simony<\/strong>, or the buying of church positions. The same was done to <strong>pluralism<\/strong> or holding more than one church office. They encouraged religious orders to promote conversion and used art to inspire the faithful.<\/p>\n<p>It was agreed that art should be straightforward, \u00a0but not necessarily simple. The works needed to have clear messages, as well as amaze the viewer. The design of the church was simplified, so side aisles and narthexes disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>The Church decided to use its <strong>great wealth<\/strong> as a sign of its <strong>success and God\u2019s grace<\/strong>. Others saw this as a sign of corruption. Counter Reformation churches became more ostentatious and more expensive to build. The idea was to incite religious passion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About St. Ignatius Loyola<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>St. Ignatius Loyola <\/strong>founded the Jesuit order to put a stop to the spread of Protestantism.

This enables the viewer to see more of it. To balance this, the figures also must appear smaller.\u00a0 A strong diagonal line, leads the viewer into the painting.<\/p>\n<p>The figures in the foreground are not identifiable. Nor are the figures a short distance behind them, to the left. We do not see faces.

It is given meaning by daily routines and activities of people who inhabit it. Humans, depending on any given day can find both joy and difficulty in the landscape. It is typical of Netherlandish painting to put in <strong>many small narratives<\/strong> and details.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong><em>Hunters in the Snow<\/em><\/strong><em>, <\/em>the main subject, the hunters, are trudging through the snow looking for food.

This new style was a reaction to the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century of Renaissance, which represented linear form in a very structured geometric way. Borromini took these geometric forms oval, squares and rectangles and choose to overlap the shapes. He also took classical elements from Greek and Roman architecture and molded them into new forms.<\/p>\n<p>Borromini was eccentric, brooding, quiet, and famous. He was a contemporary and rival to\u00a0 Gian Lorenzo Bernini and never was quite as well known.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 89. <em>Ecstasy of St. Teresa<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>. <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

He was not tall but short, and very beautiful; his face was so aflame that he appeared to be one of the highest ranks of angels who are all on fire. In his hands, I saw a great golden spear and at the iron tip, there appeared to be a point of fire. This he plunged into my heart several times so that it penetrated me to my entrails. When he pulled it out, I felt that he took me with it, and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>The pain was so severe that it made me utter several moans. The sweetness caused by this intense pain was so extreme that I did not possibly wish it to cease, nor was my soul content with anything but God.

Notice how the arrow is plunged into her public area.<\/p>\n<p>She craved God, which in Bernini\u2019s image, means she craves penetration. Sexual symbolism to represent a spiritual experience.

She had recently been canonized or made a saint in 1622.<\/p>\n<p>She lived in a Carmelite convent. While there, she\u00a0 wrote her accounts of viewing angels down. She also recorded her experience with levitations. Her diary was a best seller in 17<sup>th<\/sup> century Rome.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Direct Contact with God<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Catholic Reformation was all about pomp, extravagance, and drama, to grab the faithful and inspire piety in them. They were criticized by the Protestants, saying that Catholicism does not give the follower direct contact with God.<\/p>\n<p>Catholics began to promote stories that showed Catholics having these direct connections with the divine.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Bernini<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Gian Lorenzo Bernini was a sculptor, architect, painter, playwright, and stage designer, during the Baroque era. \u00a0His father, Pietro, trained him, with an influence toward Mannerist sculpture, as well as Hellenistic works.<\/p>\n<p>The younger Bernini was employed on huge projects in Rome, while also in demand across Europe. He was even invited to France by King Louis XIV.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 91. <em>Las Meninas<\/em>.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. Spanish. 1656 CE.

It was popularized by Caravaggio. Tenebrism is derived from the Italian word &#8216;tenebroso&#8217; which means darkened and obscuring. Certain parts of paintings, such as faces, and hands are illuminated by highlights which are contrasted by a mainly dark setting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The People in the Portrait<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is a <strong>group portrait<\/strong> of the artist in his studio at work. This <strong>genre scene<\/strong> is highly informal. It uses both normal poses and intimate glances to achieve this effect.<\/p>\n<p>Vel\u00e1zquez paints himself stepping back from his canvas to look straight at the viewer. He wears the cross of the Royal Order of Santiago, elevating him to knighthood.\u00a0 This illustrates his status both as an artist and in the community.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Infanta Margarita of Spain, is with her <strong>meninas, <\/strong>or maids and attendants<strong>.<\/strong> The infanta has just noticed the viewer, while one maid begins to curtsy.<\/p>\n<p>In the painting there is also a dwarf, which were fashionable to have by royalty, along with a dog. In the middle is a nurse or bodyguard. While in the background is Jose Nieto, the head of the queen\u2019s tapestries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>King Philip IV and his Queen<\/strong> appear in the mirror. The viewer know it is a mirror because it is reflective. The canvases and tapestries hanging around the room do not reflect light. Look closely. The angle of the canvas and the angle of the mirror do not match up.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see the painting of King Philip IV and Queen on the back wall of the room?<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Made for the King\u2019s Viewing Pleasure<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This was a painting created for King Philip IV\u2019s private study. He wanted a portrait of his daughter so that he could look up and see her everyday. The group painting makes it similar to a family photograph for personal enjoyment. Royalty would never be portrayed this way in public paintings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Bit of History<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The king was the last great Spanish Hapsburg king. \u00a0Spain\u2019s status as an international power was in decline with inflation, downward political power, and a loss of colonies.<\/p>\n<p>An alliance was created with the Catholic Church in attempt to retain power.\u00a0 Spain was deeply Catholic since the Catholic fanaticism from Isabella and Ferdinand. Art from this time is almost always religious in nature or portraiture.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Diego Vel\u00e1zquez<\/strong> (1599-1660) was born in Seville, Spain. Showing early artistic talents, he was already apprenticed, by the age of 11, to Francisco Pacheco, the city\u2019s most significant artist and art theorist. There he learned drawing, painting, still life and portraiture.<\/p>\n<p>Vel\u00e1zquez was greatly influenced by Caravaggio.<\/p>\n<p>Once he finished his apprenticeship, in 1617, he married Pacheco\u2019s daughter, and set up his own studio.<\/p>\n<p>In 1623, Vel\u00e1zquez was asked to paint a portrait of the young King Philip IV.\u00a0Soon after, he was appointed one of the court painters, enabling him to move his family to Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the years, he became remarkably close to the royal family, taking on greater responsibility within the household. By 1658, he was honored by being knighted.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 92<em>.

The Northern characteristics in this work include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of iconography<\/li>\n<li>Incredible detail<\/li>\n<li>Small-scale works<\/li>\n<li>Interior scenes<\/li>\n<li>Genre scenes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a sense of geometric and mathematical stability. The room uses 1-point perspective. Everything radiates outward from the corner of the painting behind the woman\u2019s hand. \u00a0Her hand creates a pyramid that extends downward to the tabletop.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Master of Light<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Vermeer was known as the \u201cmaster of light\u201d. The light illuminates the front of the woman\u2019s \u00a0body as it spread across the room.\u00a0 The subtle use of color softens the light, especially blue and yellow.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Camera Obscura<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The painting does not resolve clearly or come into focus until you reach the subject and her hand. \u00a0This has led historians to wonder if he was using a <strong>camera obscura<\/strong>. The word means \u201cdark chamber\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This was an ancestor to the photographic camera. <strong>Camera obscura <\/strong>took 3-D works and transformed them into 2D. It requires a viewing lens and viewing screen in a box.<\/p>\n<p>The light has a reflective quality, with distortion. Things are not in focus. A blue tinge \u00a0was common from the glass and refraction of light. There is no historical evidence to show that Vermeer owned one, but the visual evidence seems uncanny.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of the Work<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The painting urges us to conduct our lives with temperance and moderation lest we be judged. This is known as a <strong>vanitas, or vanity<\/strong> painting. It is <strong>didactic<\/strong> in that it warns us of moral depravity, vanity, and selfishness.<\/p>\n<p>The theme is judging or weighing. The woman is accessing her goods, when it is her own soul that will be weighed or judged. It is actions that matter, not possessions. It urges for a relationship between wealth and spirituality, that encourages a balance between the two.<\/p>\n<p>The Dutch were Protestant and therefore did not shun any display of wealth the way Catholics did, according to Catholic dogma.\u00a0 However, many were concerned that Dutch displays of wealth were becoming too lavish. People were more concerned with worldly possessions than spirituality.<\/p>\n<p>One term coined by art historian Simon Schama for this idea: the <strong>embarrassment of riches.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Content of the Work<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance<\/em><\/strong> is an extremely quiet <strong>genre scene. <\/strong>This is what Vermeer is known for. Women engaged in ordinary domestic activities, with tranquil and luminous interior scenes were frequent in his work.<\/p>\n<p>The woman is pregnant, which is why art historians believe the model to be the artist\u2019s wife Catherina Vermeer. The surroundings are very opulent. She is wearing exceptionally fine clothing, and a typical linen cap that women wore, while at home.<\/p>\n<p>The woman holds in her right hand a balance with nothing on either side yet. The scale is at equilibrium. This is suggestive of her inner state of mind. She seems to be about to weigh the valuables in front of her &#8212; blue cloth, open boxes, two strands of pearls and a gold chain.<\/p>\n<p>A mirror is across from her on the wall. <strong>Mirrors <\/strong>were a common type of <strong>iconography<\/strong> in Dutch Baroque art. They were meant to show vanity, futility, human excess, and concern for the worldly instead of the spiritual. Perhaps this is a <strong>vanitas<\/strong>: reminder of man\u2019s mortality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Last Judgment Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Behind the woman hangs a painting of Christ, who judges over all souls. It illustrates the blessed souls at the bottom left and the damned on the right.<\/p>\n<p>The woman\u2019s head is in a position that it divides the two. This starts the viewer questioning. Which side will she end up on? In the moment, the woman does not seem to notice the lesson or the painting.<\/p>\n<p>Art historians have questioned if this painting, within a painting, really exists, or if it came from Vermeer\u2019s imagination. It this painting is real it has never been found.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Background<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>At this period of time, the Dutch were now Protestant. Religious art was forbidden and there was no central church to commission it. \u00a0Instead, a prosperous middle class of merchants collected art and \u00a0commissioned it.<\/p>\n<p>During the <strong>Dutch Golden Age of the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century<\/strong>,\u00a0 trade and exploration of the New World and Southeast Asia led to Dutch dominance, especially in the <strong>spice trade<\/strong>. This created a tremendous wealth.<\/p>\n<p>There was great anxiety over this wealth. It needed to be used appropriately. Art was displayed in home, so they needed small, intimate works. There was a taste for art about classical mythology, as well as still lifes, landscapes, genre scenes, and portraits.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Vermeer<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Dutch painter <strong>Johannes Vermeer<\/strong> (1632-1676) created 34 works in his lifetime. Like other Golden Age artists, he painted subjects about everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring<\/em> is his most iconic work. In fact, Hollywood made it into a movie! Other paintings include <em>View from Delft<\/em> and <em>Girl with a Red Hat<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 96. <em>Fruit and Insects<\/em><em>. <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Rachel Ruysch.

Look closely at the petals, stems, leaves. Tips are crinkled and brittle, with an emphasis of implied texture in the work.<\/p>\n<p>Ruysch was known for her lively, informal arrangements. Most artists made symmetrical and formal compositions. Also, notice her use of the treatment of light she employs using <strong>tenebrism<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Scenes, like this one, were a collective observation of many plants and fruit, imaginatively compiled together to create a full composition. Historians know this because many of the components displayed together in still lifes, would not have been grown in the same season.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Harvest Scene<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The scene from <strong><em>Fruit and Insects <\/em><\/strong>is a harvest.\u00a0 It features corn, squash, chestnuts, peaches, plum, grapes, wheat, eggs, and a butterfly. Looking at more minute details, one can also see a snail and a fly.<\/p>\n<p>Christians would have seen the wheat as a reference to Eucharist, while the grapes as a symbol of alcohol.

Artist rarely specialized in it. This was not so for female artists. This was as high as they were expected to go. Male counterparts believed they did not have the mental capacity for anything higher!<\/p>\n<p>Painting was considered a hobby for women and not a profession. When women did learn how to paint they were often taught by their husbands or fathers. When they did succeed commercially, they were referred to as \u201clady painters.\u201d<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Career and Family<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ruysch was enormously successful in a 60-year career, producing over 250 paintings. For eight of those years, she was a court painter to the Bavarian court for eight years.<\/p>\n<p>She also raised 10 children!<\/p>\n<p>Ruysch grew up in Amsterdam, in a family of Dutch artists and scientist. Her father was a prominent scientist and specialized in botany. He possessed a collection of rare specimens, which she helped him catalogue and record.<\/p>\n<p>The Dutch Golden Age, in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century, fueled an interest in exotic plants and flowers including \u201cTulip Mania\u201d. Her paintings filled with observations and realistic replications were extremely popular.\u00a0 And her works sold for double that which Rembrandt\u2019s did at the time!<\/p>\n<h5><strong>UP NEXT:\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Early European and Colonial American Art<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>200- 1750<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-european-colonial-americas-3-2\/\">Topic 3.2\u00a0Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Early European and Colonial American Art<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early European and Colonial American Art 200- 1750 &nbsp; Topic 3.1\u00a0Cultural Contexts of Early European and Colonial American Art The &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-european-colonial-americas-3-1\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Early European &#038; Colonial Americas 3.1<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,9],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/102"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=102"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/102\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":475,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/102\/revisions\/475"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=102"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=102"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=102"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
