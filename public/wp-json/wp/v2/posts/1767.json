Art history surveys have traditionally offered less attention to <strong>art made from 1980 to the present<\/strong>. Although such surveys often presented contemporary art as largely a European and American phenomenon, today, contemporary art produced by artists of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the First Nations is receiving the same, if not more attention.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons for this. First, <strong>the waning of colonialism<\/strong>, inaugurated by independence movements. Then there have been <strong>shifts in the balance of power<\/strong>. Think the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the rise of China. Additionally, the <strong>development of widespread communication<\/strong> <strong>networks<\/strong> such as the internet have all contributed. Contemporary art now represents a world that is global and interconnected rather than\u00a0Eurocentric.<\/p>\n<p>The art world has expanded and <strong>become more inclusive<\/strong> since the 1960s, as artists of all nationalities, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations have challenged the traditional privileged place of white, heterosexual men in art history. This activism has been supported by theories (e.g., deconstructionist, feminist, poststructuralist, and queer) that critique perspectives on history and culture that claim universality but are in fact exclusionary.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(10) 230. <em>Pink Panther<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Jeff Koons.

The paper on this large-scale work <\/strong>does not have a nice finish and is left wrinkled. This is really just a sketch!<\/p>\n<p>The negative space is great and undefined. There is no horizon line. The reclining nude contains little to no modelling.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work is <strong>a feminist approach and retelling of popular folktales<\/strong>. The associations with Woman and Nature mean that the woman is not the victim.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are women in fairy tales always in danger or near death?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snow White<\/li>\n<li>Sleeping Beauty<\/li>\n<li>Ariel<\/li>\n<li>Cinderella<\/li>\n<li>Little Red Riding Hood<\/li>\n<li>Belle<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Women have been associated with nature. Why does this imply women wouldn\u2019t understand it? A deeper connection?<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Lying with the Wolf <\/em><\/strong>\u00a0references the tradition of the reclining female nude but transforms it. The work is\u00a0 not sexualized. She doesn\u2019t stare out but reclines with animal. The audience doesn\u2019t matter, she pays them no mind.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Closer Look<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A reclining female nude lays intimately with a wolf. This is not about bestiality, however, but it is an act of bonding between humans (especially women) and nature. The wolf nuzzles her affectionately, much like she cuddles with a dog. She strokes his fur.<\/p>\n<p>The woman has tamed the wolf\u2019s wildness. Neither is a victim any longer. This is symbiotic.<\/p>\n<p>Both figures seem to nurture one another. They are not stereotypically predator and prey. It\u2019s hard to pick who would have been the prey anyway. Is it the woman because she is vulnerable? Is it the animal to show man\u2019s power over nature?<\/p>\n<h5><strong>References<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Little Red Riding Hood<\/em><\/strong> is a story that is normally quite violent and is now rendered sweet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saint Genevieve<\/strong> the patron saint of Paris is associated with animals and her ability to domesticate wolves.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Kiki Smith<\/strong> was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1954.

This is different from the decorative and frilly opulence in the original.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The woman has no head<\/strong>. This may refer to the fate that awaited many Rococo aristocrats in the French Revolution&#8212; the guillotine!\u00a0 <em>The Swing<\/em> was seen as the epitome of excess and extravagance in the Rococo.<\/p>\n<p>The woman is black rather than white.
