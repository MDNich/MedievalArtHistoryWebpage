The people toppled the moai, upset with the ancestors for not protecting the island (theory of Jared Diamond who wrote <em>Guns, Germs, Steel<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>But there is a new theory. On the first sighting in 1722, the Dutch described the island as bountiful and thriving. In 1774, Captain James Cook described the island as having human bones everywhere and being sparsely populated. The island was exposed to European diseases for which Easter Islanders had no natural immunities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(9) 215. <em>\u2018Ahu \u2018ula (feather cape)<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Oceanic (Hawaiian).

Patterns includes symbols relating to a clan and have been described as heraldic.
