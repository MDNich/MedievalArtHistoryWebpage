Such cultural interaction may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest, and\/or colonization. It may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia, appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influences on Medieval Artists and Architects<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Continuities and exchanges between coexisting traditions in medieval Europe are evident in shared artistic forms, functions, and techniques. <strong>Medieval <\/strong><strong>artists <\/strong><strong>and architects<\/strong> were heavily influenced by earlier \u00a0and contemporary cultures, including coexisting European cultures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early medieval<\/strong> and <strong>Byzantine<\/strong> art were \u00a0influenced by Roman art and by motifs and techniques brought by migratory tribes from eastern Europe, West Asia, and Scandinavia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>High<\/strong> <strong>medieval<\/strong> <strong>art<\/strong> was influenced by Roman, Islamic, and migratory art. <strong>European Islamic art<\/strong> was influenced by Roman, migratory Byzantine, and West Asian art. Cultural and artistic exchanges were facilitated through trade and conquest.<\/p>\n<p>Before <strong>the late Middle Ages<\/strong>, the coexistence of many regional styles makes period-wide generalizations impossible. Isolated regional revivals of naturalism and classicism occurred, sometimes motivated by the association of classicism with the Roman Christian emperors and church. Other traditions, such as those of European Islamic art and early medieval migratory art, embraced calligraphic line and script, as well as dense geometrical and organic ornament.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Age of Exploration<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The advent of the <strong>Age of Exploration <\/strong><strong>in the late 15th century<\/strong> resulted in the emergence of global commercial and cultural networks via transoceanic trade and colonization. European ideas, forms, and practices began to be disseminated worldwide as a\u00a0 direct result of exploration, trade, conquest, and colonization.<\/p>\n<p>Art production in the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas exhibited <strong>a hybridization of European and indigenous ideas<\/strong>, <strong>forms, and materials<\/strong>, with some African and Asian influences. Although much colonial art is religious, nonreligious subjects\u2014such as portraiture, allegory, genre, history, and decorative arts\u2014were central to Spanish viceregal societies.<\/p>\n<p>Art production in the Spanish viceroyalties paralleled European art practices in terms of themes, materials, formal vocabulary, display, and reception. However, given the Spanish Catholic context in which this art production developed, Spanish colonial art of the early modern period corresponded more closely to that of southern Europe.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 49.

It was converted into a church by Visigoths, in 572 CE. \u00a0Then, it was made into a mosque. Following this, it was totally rebuilt by the Cordoban Caliphate. Later, it was made into a Gothic church, with buttresses and pointed vaults added. A Renaissance style nave was eventually constructed.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it is still a Catholic church.\u00a0 Beginning in early 2000s, Muslims petitioned the Church to allow them to worship here and have since been consistently denied.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3)69.<em> David<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Donatello.

Both the artist and family were interested in a revival of the classics. Yet, it is not apparent which member of the family requested the sculpture.<\/p>\n<p>The work was not for public viewing. \u00a0It could, however, \u00a0be viewed from the street through the opening gate to the Medici courtyard and home. This biblical subject was used to achieve political motives of the Medici.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Battle Between Florence and Milan<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In 1428, there was a great battle between Florence, a mercantile republic, and Milan, a military autocracy. The Florentines were not expected to win, but they did. As the underdogs, they claimed God was on their side.<\/p>\n<p>While Florence might have been a republic in name, the Medici clan ruled Florence. They placed multiple family members and allies in governmental positions. while ruling the city corruptly.<\/p>\n<p>Henceforth, the Medici family began to affiliate themselves with the biblical figure David.\u00a0 In the Bible, David is a king, with a long rule, who is enormously wise. The symbolism was David represented Florence, which equalled the Medici family. In opposition, Goliath was Milan and the Duke.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Appropriation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Florence ousted the Medici family and used the same political metaphor against them. Once the Medici clan was exiled, Florence, city officials took the statue of David and moved it to the city hall.<\/p>\n<p>The family were absent between 1494-1512. After, when they returned to retake the city, they did not pretend to be a republic anymore. They became an autocracy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of David<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In the Old Testament, David, is a young Hebrew shepherd, who slayed Goliath, with a simple sling shot.\u00a0 He was the only one brave enough. David knew he could do it, with God\u2019s help.<\/p>\n<p>Donatello picked that moment in the story to portray his triumphant David. The emphasis is not on bravery, but rather on success.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>David\u2019s stance is nonchalant, jaunty, and assured though his head is lowered to suggest humility.<\/li>\n<li>Right hand: holds Goliath\u2019s own sword&#8211;notches have been nicked out of it from many battles and it is rough bronze.<\/li>\n<li>Left hand holds a rock used to slay Goliath<\/li>\n<li>David stands on Goliath\u2019s decapitated head as a sign of total supremacy.<\/li>\n<li>David wears a soft hat, rather than a helmet like we might expect, and boots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Why is David Nude?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Many have asked this question. Surely, David was not nude when he defeated Goliath. This is <strong>Heroic nudity<\/strong> in art. It implies morality, truth, and virtue. David is not considered a \u201ctrue nude\u201d however. He still wears a hat and boots!<\/p>\n<p>Does this nudity also lead to some eroticism? Are there homoerotic overtones? Or is this depiction of an adolescent just typical for the period? Donatello was gay so this has led historians to question this work.<\/p>\n<p>David is something of an androgynous figure. David\u2019s body is that of an adolescent \u2013 not really a boy but certainly not a man yet. There is a softness, and an emphasis on the curvature of his body. The delicacy of his hat emphasizes an effeminate nature about him. The feather from Goliath\u2019s helmet runs up David\u2019s leg to touch his buttocks.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Sculpture in Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was created because of the classical revival\u2019s interest in humanism.<\/p>\n<p>For 1,000 years, since the fall of Rome, the Christians had looked at the soul, as the focus of what art should be about. The body was seen as a source of sin, and it was not to be celebrated. The body was thought to be the sources of original sin. Think Adam and Eve in Garden of Eden.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to the ancient Greek and Roman love and respect for the body was now viewed as radical. This was the first life sized, freestanding, bronze, nude sculpture since antiquity.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Donatello<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Florentine artist, Donato di Niccol\u00f2 di Betto Bardi,(1386-1466) known as Donatello, was a master in sculpture using both marble and bronze. <strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Donatello<\/strong> is best known for <strong><em>David<\/em><\/strong>, but other famous works include <em>Equestrian Statue of Gattamelate, Penitent Magdalene, <\/em>and<em> Saint George.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(3) 70. <\/strong><strong>Palazzo Rucellai<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Leon Battista Alberti.

It was a display of status, wealth, and power. It symbolises a Renaissance desire for rationality, order, and classicism.<\/p>\n<p>Frieze carvings contained billowing sails which were the symbol of the Ruccelai. The family wanted to base the building on ancient Rome architecture and the Colosseum. They felt a connection to Rome and desired to have their family members reach the ranks of cardinals and even Popes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Inside the Florentine Palazzo<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The first floor was where business was conducted. On the second floor the family received guests. The third floor was used for private family rooms. The fourth floor was hidden from the exterior and housed the servants.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About Alberti<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) was an Italian author, artist, architect, poet, philosopher, and humanist. As was the first Italian architect to study Roman architecture in depth, he travelled to Rome, where the Colosseum had a great influence on his work.<\/p>\n<p>Alberti wrote <em>De Re Aedificatoria<\/em>, containing his thoughts on ideal architecture. He developed his style, by adding classical elements to contemporary buildings and advocated a system of ideal proportions. A point of argument for Alberti was that the arch and column commonly used in Gothic churches, was incongruous.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>(3) 74.<em> Adam and Eve. <\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Albrecht D\u00fcrer.

This object is a tool, with a flat round top that fits into the palm of the hand. It has a short, sharp tip. The width and depth of the engraved line depends upon the angle the tool is used.<\/p>\n<p>Once the surface is cut it is covered with ink. This pools into the incised area. The ink is then wiped away from the surface. The surface is then applied to paper with pressure.<\/p>\n<p>The work uses <strong>hatching<\/strong> and <strong>cross-hatching<\/strong> to show value. \u00a0<strong>Hatching<\/strong> is a bunch of <strong>hatches<\/strong> or lines grouped together that are all going in the same direction. <strong>Cross-hatching <\/strong>is when groups of hatches cross over other hatches.<\/p>\n<p>The artist\u2019s monogram is included on the bottom corner of the sign in the work.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Influences<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The nude figures were influenced by Italian art. The bodies are frontal and stand in <strong>contrapposto<\/strong>. Based on Vitruvian\u2019s canon of proportions, where the face determines the proportions for the rest of the body. The\u00a0 etching was inspired by two sculptures: \u00a0<em>Apollo Belvedere<\/em> and <em>Medici Venus<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Adam and Eve <\/em><\/strong>is an early example of the muscular, and contrapposto human form, in the North. The bodies, both male and female are idealized. Notice too the use of Latin and a reference to the Four Humors, an ancient Greek theory.<\/p>\n<p>The Northern use of extraordinary minute detail and dark woods and cliffs are part of the beauty of this work. \u00a0Iconography plays a major role here\u00a0 too.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0 work is signed and proudly identifies the artist (Albert Dvrer Noricvs) as a citizen of Nuremberg (Noricus) in\u00a0 a very northern style but is written in Latin, and Italian style.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why was this Created?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Once an engraving was crafted, prints could be easily copied and disseminated to the religiously devout. The idea was promoted about temptation and sin.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is this Engraving About?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Adam and Eve stand together in a dense, dark forest, right before the Fall of Man. This acts to humanize religion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Four Humors:<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Four Humors are a classical medical philosophy that maintained humans have four humors. When these are in balance, our personalities are perfectly at ease. When one of these is greater than the others, our personalities change.<\/p>\n<p>Christians believed that in the Garden of Eden, before the Fall of Man, all the humors were balanced. After the Fall, Christians believed that one humor predominated in everyone, throwing our temperaments into imbalance.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Iconography<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Here are some of the symbols in <em>Adam and Eve<\/em> along with what they mean.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Snake:<\/strong> symbolizes the devil<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parrot:<\/strong> these birds were collector\u2019s items in Germany and the noise they make&#8211; \u201cEve Ave\u201d \u2013 sounded similar to Eve and Ave Maria (Hail Mary)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Goat:<\/strong> reference to a scapegoat, standing precariously on his mountain perch balancing before the fall.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cat:<\/strong> symbolizes Christ, must catch the devil (mouse)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mouse:<\/strong> represents Satan (Remember Merode Altarpiece\u2019s mousetrap)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Yellow bile<\/strong> (angry): Cat<\/li>\n<li><strong>Black bile<\/strong> (melancholic): Elk<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blood<\/strong> (energetic): Rabbit<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phlegm<\/strong> (lethargic): Ox<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eve\u2019s hair<\/strong>: long, curly, hair worn down symbolizes sexual energy as she takes the apple<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adam\u2019s hair: <\/strong>curly too, he may succumb to the same sexuality as Eve does<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>In true Renaissance fashion Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471-1528) was a master painter, printer, goldsmith, art theorist and human scholar.

Politically, mosques were a way for the Ottomans to show they had beat the Byzantine Empire.\u00a0 It also symbolized Islam over Christianity.<\/p>\n<p>The mosque\u2019s design was based on Hagia Sophia. It was a statement of triumph to both the patron,\u00a0 and the architect.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Patron and Location<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ottoman Sultan<strong> Selim II<\/strong>, the new Ottoman ruler, was the son of Son of Suleyman the Magnificent, who brought the Ottomans to the greatest territorial height. This mosque was built at the peak of Ottoman power in the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p>When the ruler commissioned the work, he chose this spot specifically for the mosque. It was on the highest and would dominate the skyline.<\/p>\n<p>Edirne, where the mosque is located, was the capital city of the Ottomans. It was the westernmost Ottoman city. For Europeans who may have encountered the city, it strategically made a good first impression.<\/p>\n<p>This was the center of the community. The mosque had a school, or <strong>madrasas<\/strong> for studying Prophet Muhammad and his sayings. There was also a market, soup kitchen, bath, hospital, hospice, and cemetery.\u00a0 The mosque was the meeting point to draw everyone together.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Architect<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Sinan was a hugely famous and successful architect. He served four sultans over the course of his career, which made him wealthy. Sinan owned 77 properties, including 40 shops, inns, and Turkish baths.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Mosque of Selim II<\/strong> is considered his great masterpiece.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fun Fact:<\/strong> American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, wrote in his book: \u2018<em>Two architects have come on earth.

It may have been created by Jose de la Rios.<\/p>\n<p>Established artists were unable to leave Europe and their wealthy patrons to move to the Americas. <strong>La Paz School<\/strong> workshop was known for crafting works of well dressed of angels carrying guns.

Yet, the elongation and extended lines of angel\u2019s body recalls the Mannerist style, still preferred in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century Americas.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work would have been part of a larger series of various angels.\u00a0 The audience was native, mostly Inca and indigenous tribes, of Catholic, Protestant, or indigenous religions.<\/p>\n<p>An armed angel represented the idea of divine protection over faithful Christians and the need for Catholics to defend their faith. It represented both Catholic and Spanish power over indigenous peoples. This was meant to take the place of native deities and promote Catholicism within the New World.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Understanding this Painting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Asiel indicates the name of the angel, and a quality of \u201cFears God\u201d. The androgynous angel is stunningly attired. The pose is based off a series of Dutch engravings of military positions and guns.<\/p>\n<p>The clothing combines contemporary European aristocratic fashion with Inca nobility fashion. The broad-brimmed hat, billowing sleeves and tights are European. \u00a0The ornate clothing and feathered hat were Inca. Feathers were a sign of gods.<\/p>\n<p>A<strong> harquebus<\/strong> is a firearm with a long barrel, created by the Spanish in the 15<sup>th<\/sup> century. This gun, that rested on the shoulder, was considered the height of firearm technology.\u00a0 Firearms did not exist in Americas prior to colonization, so natives associated them with the supernatural.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Background Story <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was painted in the Spanish colony of Peru.\u00a0 Images like these were widespread and popular throughout the Andes and used to promote the Christianization of indigenous peoples.\u00a0 There were not many Protestants in the New World. This allowed Catholics to increase their numbers.<\/p>\n<p>The Christian missionary orders persistently sought to end indigenous practices and promote Catholicism. Catholic Reformation promoted a militaristic ideology that portrayed the Church as an army and its followers as soldiers. Violence was justified in defence of the Catholic faith.<\/p>\n<p>Council of Trent had only allowed depictions of angels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael for clarity of message. In the New World this was ignored.<\/p>\n<h5>UP NEXT:<\/h5>\n<p><strong>Early European and Colonial Americas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>200- 1750<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-european-colonial-art-3-3\/\">Topic 3.3\u00a0Materials, Processes, and Techniques in Early European and Colonial American Art<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early European and Colonial Americas 200- 1750 Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Early European and\u00a0 Colonial American Art A &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-european-colonial-americas-3-2\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Early European &#038; Colonial Armericas 3.2<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,9],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/114"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=114"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/114\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2748,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/114\/revisions\/2748"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=114"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=114"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=114"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
