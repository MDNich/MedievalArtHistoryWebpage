Seventeen such heads were found in the low-lying Gulf Coast area of Mexico in the cities of San Lorenzo, La Venta, Tres Zapotes. They measure from 1.5 meters to 3.5 meters in height and weight from 6 to 50 tons and are carved in a volcanic rock called basalt.<\/p>\n<p>The apogee of the Olmec cities happened almost at the same time as Remus and Romulus founded Rome and Athenians reached their Golden Age. The impressive cultural legacy of the Olmec cities (2000-400 BCE) spread throughout ancient Mexico during the first millennium BCE.<\/p>\n<p>Later <strong>Mesoamerican cultures such as the Maya and Aztec revered the Olmec artworks<\/strong> and used them as burial items or as offerings to the gods. This was the case of the Olmec-style jadeite head mask brought from a distant Gulf area.

Although it looks like a mask, it was not worn this way as <strong>it does not have cut outs for the eyes and nose.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While the stylized Olmec like mask is small, almost the size of a human palm, and the head is a realistically carved megalith, they both represent heads wearing a helmet. The mask only suggests having it, by the means of the smooth, highly polished forehead.<\/p>\n<p>These artworks are traditionally interpreted as portraits of chiefs, kings, ancestors, or deities dressed for a ball game, being early evidence for the importance of a ballgame in the cultures of Mesoamerica.<\/p>\n<p>The head-like figures symbolized the very concept of rulership either by a colossal imposing and sturdy presence or by a smaller representation using a more expensive material and incorporating symbolic animal traits.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Made with a Single Block<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Olmec heads and masks<\/strong> were <strong>carved from a single block of stone<\/strong>. The work demanded by both artworks was immense as both basalt and jadeite are hard to carve. The large sections were sawed with string and grit. The face details would have been made by an abrasion method followed by polishing.<\/p>\n<p>The abrasion method would have required the rubbing of the same kind of very hard stone onto the artwork and the use of a mixture of sand and water as an abrasive.<\/p>\n<p>For <strong>smaller sized ritual objects<\/strong> such as masks and axes, the Olmecs favored the expensive <strong>green-blue jadeite<\/strong>. They associated the greenstone with <strong>fertility and growing corn<\/strong>, and they retrieved it from the faraway Guatemalan mountains.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>In Comparison<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The faces have a strong jawline and very simplified elongated ears that frame the face. The same specific parts of the head have more volume and relief, looking almost fleshy. Note the chin, the nose, and the upper lip. The faces show aesthetic maturity and individuality as no two heads or masks are alike. They also have lifeless traits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The colossal head<\/strong> looks severed. Since <strong>the mask<\/strong> is unwearable It was probably either a costume element, or a mummy mask. The mask is almost modern showing a remarkable simplicity and elegance. It reflects the cult of a mythical human-jaguar being, the \u201cwere-jaguar\u201d through symbolic facial features such as the slanted, almond eyes, and the slightly downturned mouth. Note the drilled cleft marks, also called jaguar snarl.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, the basalt colossal stone head is more detailed and realistic. The feline traits that constitute the later divinity signs in Olmec art are absent in this colossal head. Its helmet-like headdress is adorned with distinctive elements symbolizing a group membership.<\/p>\n<p>Other symbolic elements might have been the large ear spools inserted into the ear lobes. We know that the later Maya considered holes and passages of all kinds as points of entry into the supernatural world. They wore jade ear spools to symbolically mark the passageways for the soul. One of the most common Maya phrases for death, och bih (literally &#8220;to enter\/go on\u201d).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Olmec Architecture <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>La Venta<\/strong> Olmec site, in Tabasco, Mexico, from 394 BCE has a The Great Pyramid in the center. It stands 110 feet high and is one of the earliest pyramids known in Mesoamerica. It is rectangular in shape, with stepped sides and inset corners, although this could be due to erosion.<\/p>\n<p>The Altar 4 at La Venta, it is roughly 2 meters high and twice as wide. It has a sculpture with elaborate dress carved into it, which makes the figures appear to be sitting in the mouth of a cave.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1228\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/laventaaltar.jpg?resize=726%2C431&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"726\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/laventaaltar.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/laventaaltar.jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Important Olmec Regions\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>One of the <strong>most important cultural<\/strong> centers of this period is the region of <strong>Oaxaca.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiable deities began to appear in works<\/li>\n<li>Primitive glyphic writing developed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other important cultural centers such as Izapa and Kaminaljuy\u00fa emerged south of the Maya area.

He had difficulty being accepted by the Mayans because he <strong>lacked royal status. <\/strong>Therefore, many did not consider him the rightful heir to the throne.\u00a0 To legitimize his throne, he had decorative steles and reliefs added to Yaxchilan.<\/p>\n<p>The City-state of Yaxchilan <strong>collapsed in the 9<sup>th<\/sup> century<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s a fact: <\/strong>Maya writing was not fully deciphered until the 1970s and 1980s.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Women and the Maya Court <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Women played <strong>a prominent role<\/strong> in the Maya court.\u00a0 They held positions as queens and mothers.

This helped to dedicate new buildings, legitimize kings, and commemorate births of children.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bloodletting for queens<\/strong> was believed to grant significant visions.

Although the exact date of the building is unknown, evidence of human occupation dates to 564 BCE. \u00a0The remains of Tulum today, include buildings, tombs, and platforms, inside the walls. Here, visitors find outstanding examples of Mayan culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Great Outer Wall<\/strong> was built for both defence and to separate religious structures. The Inner Precinct has the most important buildings. These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Castle<\/li>\n<li>The Temple of the Descending God<\/li>\n<li>The Temple of the Initial Series<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>The Castle\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The most important monument in Tulum is El Castillo (The Castle). Reaching to 25 feet tall, it stands at the front of a bluff overlooking the ocean. The castle was a shrine and a center to host ceremonies. At night-time, when the torches were lit, the building helped to navigate boats through the coral reefs. The Mayan were traders with a reach as far as Honduras.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Temple of the Descending God<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is a well-preserved building. The temple is built upon another flat roofed structure. Murals decorated the fa\u00e7ade. Intertwining snakes, the sun, rain, and the corn god can still be seen.<\/p>\n<p>A small stairway leads to the one room temple. Inside are two benches and a window. Above the doorway, there is a winged god crafted in stucco. Inside, the hand painted walls illustrate offerings, under a blue border. This symbolizes the night sky.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Temple of the Initial Series<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This one room building has a stone lintel on the outside and a wood one on the inside. Two figures once flanked the door, but now only a partial one remains. Inside, the same figures decorate each corner. A small alter still remains. A broken stele was found and now housed in the British Museum.<\/p>\n<p>The roof is a curved arc. Small windows look out to the south, east, and west.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Other Structures of the Inner Precinct \u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Within the Inner Precinct there are also temples, shrines, and a platform. The shrines are built lower than the temples. The walls here are low and used for the purpose of separating the buildings.<\/p>\n<p>Historians believe the platform was used for dances and other performances.

Tlaloc was the god of water, rain, agriculture, and fertility. The Aztecs created the blue and white Northern temple for this god.\u00a0 Huitzilopochli was the god of warfare, fire, sun and sacrifice and the Southern temple of white and red was built for this god. Together, the gods symbolized \u201cburning water\u201d which connoted warfare.<\/p>\n<p>The structure shows the <strong>Aztec belief that they could control and influence the cosmos.<\/strong> The spring and autumn equinox rise between the two temples. <strong>Templo Mayor<\/strong> was believed to be an axis mundi. It sat on the center of the four quadrants of the empire as a small version of the universe. It illustrated power, piety, and place of worship both daily and otherwise.

General cultural similarities across the Andes included an emphasis on surviving and interacting with the <strong>challenging environments, reciprocity, and cyclicality<\/strong>, rather than individualism. There was a reverence for the <strong>animal and plant worlds<\/strong> as part of the practice of <strong>shamanistic religion<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As with ancient Mesoamerica, the Central Andes region was a seat of culture and art parallel to the \u201cOld World\u201d in antiquity, diversity, and sophistication. <strong>Baskets<\/strong> from this region have been found dating to as early as 8800 BCE, proving early peopling from Asia through the rest of the Americas was accomplished by Neolithic times.<\/p>\n<p>The culture practiced <strong>artificial mummification, or embalming<\/strong>, of the dead, along with <strong>leaving items with the bodies<\/strong> in graves for use in the afterlife. <strong>Golden jewelry found in tombs<\/strong> was in natural shapes like birds and other creatures, evidence of both funerary art practices and the connection of natural elements in artworks. The architecture of the Andean region integrated the environment and was a representation of power and social hierarchy within the culture and community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chav\u00edn<\/strong> and <strong>Inka<\/strong> were representative and distinct early and late cultures and styles. <strong>Chav\u00edn <\/strong>lived in the northern highlands with reach to the southern coast between 1200\u2013500 BCE. While the <strong>Inka <\/strong>between 1438\u20131534 CE covered the entire Central Andes. Yet many other important, art producing cultures existed between them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Chav\u00edn Culture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Chavins were a religious culture whose temple at <strong>Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar<\/strong> was the destination of religious pilgrimages to experience the <strong>Lanz\u00f3n Stela<\/strong>, an ornate carved pillar that is symbolic of a central figure represented with a feline head and a human body that was worshiped. The temple featured relief sculptures with images of the deities worshiped. Pilgrims would travel long distances in search of religious visions and messages. They would encounter the Lanz\u00f3n Stela in the midst of a series of dark tunnels at the center of the temple. The Chav\u00edn culture gave way to cultures such as Nazca, Huari, Chim\u00fa, and Chankas.<\/p>\n<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that a small tribe called the Inca defeated the Chankas in battle, marking the start of the Inca Empire.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Inca Culture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Within the lifespan of five kings, the <strong>Inca gained control of the west coast of South America<\/strong>, becoming the largest nation in the world at that time, and existed for less than a century.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inca administration was like that of the Roman Empire<\/strong>&#8212; although ruling officials changed, local languages and ethnic cultures in the 80 provinces remained intact. <strong>Rulers imposed conformity in religious practices and instituted the Inca language<\/strong>, Quechua, as the primary method of communication.<\/p>\n<p>Like the Roman Empire, the Inca <strong>relocated groups of people within the empire<\/strong> to redistribute uncooperative tribes to loyal areas, while weavers, farmers, stone workers, and artisans were moved to areas where there was a need for their skill set. This contributed to the rapid growth of the Inca Empire and established a complex system of labor taxation. This system required citizens to contribute by providing labor for community-managed lands, for construction needs, for military campaigns, or for textile production.<\/p>\n<p>The goods and services produced were redistributed to the population in three ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>support of religious needs<\/li>\n<li>support of the emperor, construction, and military campaigns<\/li>\n<li>support of the citizens<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>(5) 153.

Thus, their message for the outsiders is superficial, while those with a spiritual <strong>(Chavin)<\/strong> or political knowledge <strong>(Umayyad)<\/strong> can fully decipher the artwork.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>ivory objects<\/strong> produced in Al-Andalus between 950-1050 CE <strong>boxes or pyxides<\/strong> were most often used as a container for precious materials (perfumes, cosmetics) or insignia of power (regalia) and they were for the most part produced in the Madinat al-Zahra workshops of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. We can safely assume that these objects were status symbolic gift for life cycle occasions in family the of the caliph such as marriage, birth, and coming of age. Most of these ivories mention the name of recipient of the gift, as well as the artist, the place, and the year.<\/p>\n<p>The lid of the pyxis shows two lions symbolizing the Umayyads and a Kufic calligraphic inscription blessing the al-Mughira: \u201cG-d\u2019s blessing, favors, joy, beatitude to al-Mughira, son of the Commander of the faithful, may G-d have mercy upon him\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>There is a repeated presence of <strong>royal iconographic symbols<\/strong> such as <strong>falcons, lions, and a lute player<\/strong> flanked by two princely figures. One holds the braided scepter and flask of the Umayyads, while the other only holds a fan. There are men on horseback <strong>date-picking<\/strong>. The dates allude to the lost lands of Syria.<\/p>\n<p>This indicates that <strong>a political message<\/strong> was sent to the prince. This message uses the preexisting royal symbolism manipulating it through wisdom fables. The revised royal iconography now no longer appears as proof of the virtues of the \u201csovereign\u201d but rather suggest the legitimacy of the heir.<\/p>\n<p>The depictions of agricultural and abundance becomes an argument for the caliph\u2019s legitimacy and his innate art of governing.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main lobes shows two young boys stealing eggs from an eagle\u2019s nest. They are bitten by dogs. This is probably a reference to the quest for sovereignty. The Umayyads of Spain were known as \u2018the falcons of the Quraysh\u2019 and Cordoba was sometimes compared to an egg. \u00a0As a present to the caliph\u2019s 2nd son, it is an allegoric warning to not break the succession line.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1053\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/3-57.-Front-View.jpg?resize=323%2C431&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/3-57.-Front-View.jpg?w=323&amp;ssl=1 323w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/3-57.-Front-View.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another shows two riders picking dates accompanied by two wolfs\/dogs pulling down by the tail two birds that are trying to eat the seeds of the palm tree symbol of the lost lands of Umayyads.<\/p>\n<p>The last image contains a very clear warning. It uses the image of a lion that overpowers a bull. The image might be a simple assertion of the power of the lion (caliph\u2019s heir) or might depict a story from Indian fables translated by the Umayyads in Castilian. The story in which the Lion Kills the Bull is emblematic of two friends whom a liar jackal contrives to disunite. The political warning is even more relevant given that later Al Mughira was assassinated on the day in which his brother died to prevent any claim he might have had against his young nephew.<\/p>\n<p>Located in the Northern Highlands of Peru, on a trade route between the coast and the Amazon basin, the site of <strong>Chavin de Huantar<\/strong> was an important religious center between 900 and 200 BCE dominating an extended territory from the highlands to the coast. The ceremonial center controlled the Andean social life through religious leadership. The priests of Chavin held both public and exclusive (in the temple interiors) spiritual ceremonies and rituals during which the intoxicated believers interacted with the supernatural anthropomorphic gods depicted in several of the site&#8217;s sculptures.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Chavin sculptures<\/strong> draw on the ancient fear and reverence of humans in front of the apex predators (<strong>snake, caymans, jaguar, hawks<\/strong>) and use their features to enhance the power of the priests and their control over the masses of believers. An outsider could still perceive the power of the sculptures by identifying toothed mouths, emerging animal limbs or snakes, but he\/she would be unable to identify the primary figure and make sense of the iconography used.<\/p>\n<p><strong>El Lanzon and the Staff god<\/strong> from the Raimundi stella exhibit <strong>contour rivalry<\/strong> which is a representational technique that uses two images with shared parts or outlines, usually a human with features of a predator. The Lanzon deity has jaguar fangs and caiman talons, and its eyebrows and hair is represented through snakes. The fearsome Staff God also has the same downturned mouth with feline fangs. His head is multi-faced. The stacked headdress is composed of more cayman (also spelled caiman\u2014which is an alligatoridae) faces terminated in curls and snake heads.<\/p>\n<p>By flipping the stele, the god becomes benevolent as its headdress is transformed into a stack of smiling caiman faces. The visually confusing style creates a hierarchy between intimated believers who can see true form and those who cannot.<\/p>\n<p>With an iconography of power symbols, the Chavin society uses art to expand its power and transitions from an egalitarian state (in which people are close to equal in status and power, and permanent leadership is rare) to a hierarchical state with differences in rights and power between segments of the population, and a strong, usually hereditary leadership.<\/p>\n<p>Both objects survived the destruction of the caliphate and of the <strong>pre-Columbian Chavin civilization.<\/strong> While the new Christian owners of the pyxis and today\u2019s Peruvians appreciate the artworks material value and technical excellence, their powerful grip on people was lost together, with most of their symbolism.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 159.

Each individual stone is fitted uniquely to the one placed next to it. This results in blocks that have a varied number of sides. The goal is to keep each stone as true to its original shape as possible, but just flattened on the sides presented. This means the \u00a0blocks were not going to be like bricks.\u00a0 Stones that are fitted this way allow for a small amount of movement. This is especially important in an earthquake-prone region.

They were indoctrinated into Inca culture since the empire was very vast and diverse. They became valuable advocates for Inca traditions.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Templo Mayor and the City of Cusco.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h4><strong>How religion influenced art. The expression of sacred across time and culture.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<blockquote><p>Both <strong>Tenochtitlan<\/strong> (founded in 1325 on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco) and the <strong>City of Cusco<\/strong> (11th &#8211; 12th century, rebuilt by Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui (1418\u20131471\/1472) represent carefully planned urban and religious environments. Each is divided into four distinct parts which reflected the cosmos order and the power structures within the Aztec and Inca Empire.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The center of both religious precincts consisted of large plazas surrounded by ceremonial platforms. Their main temples, <strong>The Twin Towers of the Templo Mayor<\/strong> (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City 1375\u20131520 C.E.) and the <strong>Qorikancha <\/strong>(Cusco, c. 1440-1540) were considered axis mundi and were positioned at the center of their respective empires. The temples were subdivided between the main gods of each of the cultures. Thus, the north (right) side shrine of the Templo Mayor was associated with the mountain Tonacatepetl, i.e. the \u201cMountain of Sustenance\u201d dedicated to Tlaloc, the god of rain and the other, on the south (left) side, was associated with the mountain Coatepetl, i.e. the \u201cSerpent Mountain\u201d dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. At its turn Qorikancha contained the temples of Creator god Viracocha, the sun-god Inti, the moon goddess, the god of thunder, and the rainbow god, as well as a magnificent garden sculpted in good and silver, dedicated to the Sun-god.<\/p>\n<p>The Qorikancha garden reproduced in precious metals (gold and silver) the variety of plants and animals that grew under the light of the Sun god and allowed the Incas to feed their empire. A special place in the garden was given to the maize. A preserved maize cobs sculpture shows to what extent the Inca metalworkers mimicked life-sized corns on the stalk.<\/p>\n<p>While both temple\u2019s stories were concerned with the <strong>Sun and the Moon<\/strong> mixing mythology with astronomy, the <strong>Aztec Serpent Mountain<\/strong> tells a much darker story. The key for deciphering the Temple Major story was the discovery of the Coyolxauhqui monolith, at the base of the stairs of the Serpent Temple. The large monolith, approximately 3.5 meters as diameter and weighing about 8 tones, represents a female deity \u201cCoyolxauhqui, or Bells-on-her-face\u201d carved in low relief. Her body adorned with an exquisite headdress and earrings is dismembered. Her bones are showing off and despite having the attributes of a mother (sagging belly, elongated breasts) she is shown in a humiliating nakedness.<\/p>\n<p>Coyolxauhqui\u2019s myth tells that after realizing that her mother Coatlicue, the earth, is magically pregnant with a new god, she became jealous and convinced her 400 brothers, the stars, to kill their mother. Still in his mother&#8217;s womb, the sun that was to be born perceived the threat and emerged ready for battle. He cut off the moon deity into pieces, which explained why the Moon was divided into quarters in the sky.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The temples also served as ceremonial centers.<\/strong> At <strong>Templo Major<\/strong> the ceremonies consisted in the public reenactment of the Coyolxauhqui\u2019s death thrown down the mountain-stairs doubled by a blood and organs sacrifice in the bowl of the chacmool at the base of the Tlaloc side of the temple.<\/p>\n<p>At <strong>Qorikancha<\/strong> the access to the temples was probably restricted to the Inca rulers., their families and high ranked officials. Only a gold statue represented Inti, as a small, seated boy, like Midday Sun, was brought out into the open air each day and returned in the night. However, 41 sacred sight lines (ceques) radiated as sun rays out of Qorikancha, four of them being the main 4 Inca 2 roads. \u00a0Shrines were placed along these lines and different noble families tended to and held rituals at the shrines throughout the year.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Spanish conquistadores affected both Templo Mayor and the Qorikancha Temples of Cuzco in a similar way. The sacred precinct of Templo Mayor was completely buried underneath colonial buildings, behind the cathedral of the City of Mexico, while atop the Qorikancha site the conquistadores built the baroque Catholic Church of Santo Domingo maintaining only the Inca stone foundations. Despite the Spanish chronicles that reflect the admiration for the pre-existing Inca and Aztec temples, their destruction was carried out as a physical expression of a spiritual and political conquest.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This large-scale destruction can be understood in the context of the 1492 Spanish Reconquista, an event preceding the voyages of conquistadores. The Christian Spanish people fought with the Saracen kingdoms expulsing the Muslims and the Jews from Spain. In the reconquered territories the mosques (ex. Cordoba) were transformed into churches.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 160. Maize cobs.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Inca. 1400-1533 CE.

The book contains a chronological and detailed history of Mexico City, especially of the founders and rulers. This included information about the organization and foundation of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. A summary of tributes given by 33 provinces to the Aztecs is also in the book.<\/p>\n<p>The work is insightful as it shows everyday lives of Aztecs from birth to death. Part of the book contained indigenous manuscripts and stories.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>European Meets Aztec<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The book format is European influenced. It has a linear organization that creates a clear historical order. Each page is one idea or subject, as per the European desire for order and categorize.<\/p>\n<p>The Aztec influence illustrates the settlement of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec conquest and Aztec defeat all in one. This was common to depict multiple scenes or narratives in one image.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Image<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This shows the diagram of Tenochtitlan, with the city <strong>divided into four parts<\/strong>, representing the actual four canals that divided the city. The Aztecs believed the world was divided into four eras and four regions \u2013 north, south, east, west&#8211; with the Aztecs at the center.<\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>center is an eagle on a cactus<\/strong>, growing from a rock.\u00a0 The simple structure above the eagle symbolizes the Templo Mayor. This would have been at the center of the city. Below the cactus and stone is a war shield, indicating the Aztecs had to conquer this land.<\/p>\n<p>Different types of plants, especially maize, dot the city\u2019s four quadrants. This references the agricultural fertility associated with the city. Ten men are depicted in the four quadrants, wearing white garments and top knots. These are the leaders of the ten clans that comprised the Aztecs, who led the people to the island. Their name glyphs are attached to them.<\/p>\n<p>On <strong>the left triangle at point<\/strong> is a priest with a red ear and ash colored skin. This is a symbol of ritual bloodletting. In the <strong>register at the bottom<\/strong> are two scenes of military conquest of the early Aztec settlements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On the border<\/strong> glyphs are used that indicate years. The one with a dagger above it indicated the \u00a0first year of the new 52-year cycle, \u00a0at the start of which human sacrifice must occur. Glyphs indicate years through which Spanish takeover happened.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Historical View<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Tenochtitlan was established in the middle of Lake Texcoco, in the Valley of Mexico, \u00a0in 1325. According to Aztec myth, the patron deity Huitzilopochtli told the Aztecs to leave their ancestral home and look for a place where they saw an eagle, atop a cactus, growing from a rock. That was where they should settle and build a city.<\/p>\n<p>Aztecs were conquered by Spanish in 1519-1521. Viceroyalty of New Spain was established.<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy Antonio Mendoza intended to send the codex to the Spanish king HRE Charles V. While the book was on a Spanish ship to Spain, French pirates captured the ship and took the goods on board. The codex ended up in France, \u00a0where it was sold. It was acquired by Andre Thevet, the cosmographer to King Henry II of France. Thevet wrote his name on several pages.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Native North American Art <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Native<\/strong> <strong>North<\/strong> <strong>America<\/strong> denotes traditionally oriented cultures <strong>north<\/strong> <strong>of<\/strong> <strong>the<\/strong> <strong>United<\/strong> <strong>States\u2013Mexico<\/strong> <strong>border<\/strong> from ancient times to the present, with an emphasis on the period from 1492 century to today.

The head is at the northeast. The tail is roughly located in the southwest. There are seven winding coils in between.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Essentially, we are looking at a Native American version of Stonehenge. The head aligns with the summer solstice sunset or longest day of the year. Tail points to the winter solstice sunrise or shortest day of the year. The curves of the body parallel lunar phases.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps this was used to mark time or seasons. Maybe it was made to indicate when to plant and when to harvest. It also may have been used as a kind of compass in alignment with the Pole Star.<\/p>\n<p>The size is significant and must have had some desire to impress or amaze. Consider other large works like <em>Bayeux Tapestry<\/em>, <em>Night Attack at Sanjo Palace<\/em>, <em>Trajan\u2019s column<\/em>.

European influence affected the content and materials of the Native North Americans to the point that what is now considered traditional is constantly changing.<\/p>\n<p>Centuries of interaction with colonial and migrant peoples means that <strong>some imported materials like glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon are now considered traditional<\/strong>. Likewise, in subject matter, the <strong>Spanish-introduced horse<\/strong> has become a cultural and artistic staple, <strong>alongside the indigenous buffalo, raven, and bear.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Archaeologists must rely on alternative sources of information for Native North American art, including oral and written tribal history, written ethnohistoric documents, modern artists&#8217; accounts and interviews, and museum records. Historical sources may be inaccurate depending on whether native or European sources are used.<\/p>\n<p>European influence is inevitable but may be subtle. What is considered traditional is constantly changing. There is no singular, timeless, authentic Native American art, or practice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 163.
