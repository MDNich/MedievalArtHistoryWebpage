Each work is <strong>based on an Old Master<\/strong> masterpiece showing her in it. She portrays a feminist hero. Many of her photographs show stereotypes of women or traditionally strong women.<\/p>\n<p>Judith has traditionally been viewed as strong, but alternatively dangerous and sexual.<\/p>\n<p>She <strong>blends aspects of painting with photography<\/strong>. By creating a photograph modeled after a painting, she becomes a prop even though we assume photography is truthful. We are supposed to realize photography is as much a construct as painting was.<\/p>\n<p>When critiquing the photography, we cannot avoid the fact it can be heavily manipulated. But it also argues for the legitimacy of photography as artistic. If photography can replicate a painting, then photography must have some merits and must be like painting.<\/p>\n<p>This work depicts as reality something that was originally a painting. It presents painting via photography.\u00a0 Photography cannot be inherently trusted even though this is generally our attitude. (Think magazines and social media).<\/p>\n<p>What Cindy Sherman is really doing is what Daguerre tried to do. That is to illustrate that photography can replicate painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What We See<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This replicates <strong>the story of Judith and Holofernes<\/strong>.

This might be a reference to early Renaissance difficulties with foreshortening.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Feminist Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Feminist art aims to look back through the canon of art history and draws attention to women through women\u2019s stories, female subjects, and female artists.

To save her people from the Assyrian king, she seduced her way into the tent of the general Holofernes. She then got him drunk and beheaded him.

The artwork measures 6 feet 3 inches by 6 feet and 9 inches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Faith Ringgold<\/strong> calls this work a <strong>story-quilt<\/strong>. She creates <strong>a central image using acrylic paint on canvas<\/strong>, then surrounds it with a patchwork cloth border that includes her <strong>handwritten text<\/strong>. In this way, she <strong>utilizes text and image together<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Next, she sandwiches a layer of batting underneath the canvas and on top of another piece of cloth. The figures are simple, flat, and stiff with a space that is shallow.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Through her art, she can rewrite the past through weaving together the history of African Americans and women. This is an alternative to the white masculine narratives that are prevalent in art history. This highlights the ways in which African-Americans and their experiences have been left out. Through most of history they have not been the subjects or the intended audiences of Western painting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ringgold\u2019s<\/strong> technique challenges the definition of painting and <strong>fine art<\/strong>. She HAS used acrylic on canvas but has mixed in the prominent <strong>folk art<\/strong>\/craft tradition of quilting. Folk art is often defined in part by being produced by untrained artists.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is the first in Ringgold\u2019s series of twelve \u201cstory quilts\u201d called <strong><em>The French Collection. <\/em><\/strong>The story tells the fictional narrative of Willa Marie Simone, a young black woman who moves to Paris in the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>Willa Marie\u2019s adventures in Paris in the 1920s lead her to meet celebrities: Picasso, Matisse, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Josephine Baker.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>three paintings<\/strong> that the work shows as a backdrop at the Louvre are <strong>all by DaVinci<\/strong>: <em>Madonna and Child and St. Anne; Mona Lisa; Virgin of the Rocks<\/em>. Note all the paintings are of woman and girls.<\/p>\n<p>The girls dancing in front of the art become the show \u2013 instead of the historical white version on the walls!<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Text<\/strong><\/h5>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Text on this image<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p><em>Marcia and her three little girls took me dancing at the Louvre. I thought I was taking them to see the Mona Lisa, but you\u2019ve never seen anything like this. Well, the French hadn\u2019t either. Nevermind Leonardo da Vinci and Mona Lisa, Marcia and her three girls were the show<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5><strong>Art Expansion<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work is an expansion of the art world and the art object. <strong>Faith Ringgold<\/strong> is an African American woman, and the Art object is now a folk art\/fine art hybrid. This reflects shifts into post-Modernism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Post-Modernism<\/strong> rejects Modernism\u2019s emphasis on universal meaning and abstraction.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why the Story Quilts were Made<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ringgold\u2019s story-quilting technique is important. <strong>Her mother was a fashion designer and seamstress<\/strong>. When her mother died in 1981, Ringgold started making these quilts.<\/p>\n<p>Quilts have been associated with <strong>women\u2019s domestic work<\/strong> and <strong>women\u2019s connections with one another. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Quilting is often done collectively. Young girls watch and participate to learn family stories, cultural backgrounds, and technical skills.<\/p>\n<p>Quilts were of particular importance to the history of African Americans. On the Underground Railroad, codes and hidden messages were sewn onto quilts in safe houses that could help slaves find more secret routes and safe houses to the North.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(10) 233. <em>Trade (Gifts for Trading Land with White People). <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith<strong>. <\/strong>1992.

This is a common artistic subject in Japan. In these images, Buddha rested on a lotus blossom, surrounded by Bodhisattvas, the enlightened beings who do not pass on to nirvana. Pastel-colored aliens act as the Bodhisattva while Mori acts as Buddha.

They are not stereotypically predator and prey. It\u2019s hard to pick who would have been the prey anyway. Is it the woman because she is vulnerable?
