This object is a tool, with a flat round top that fits into the palm of the hand. It has a has a short, sharp tip. The width and depth of the engraved line depends upon the angle it is used.<\/p>\n<p>Once the surface is cut it is covered with ink. This pools into the incised area. The ink is then wiped away from the surface. The surface is applied to paper with pressure.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Saskia and his love for her, inspired Rembrandt to create this work. Prints were a way to make art accessible to more people, many of whom would later buy paintings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Couple Captured<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>This work is a double portrait<\/strong> or marriage portrait of Rembrandt and his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh. This is the only etching in which the two of them appear together. They look up at the viewer, as if they were just interrupted from enjoying a moment together. Both are sitting and a table and Rembrandt has a pencil in hid hand. He has been sketching.<\/p>\n<p>Saskia is shown as supportive and attentive to her husband. Rembrandt dominates the image and gazes directly at the viewer. Both are wearing historical clothing from the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Theme of Self Portraits<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Self-Portraits were a\u00a0 common theme for Rembrandt. He created more than 100 in the span of 40 years. He often posed his subjects in costume as a form of play acting.<\/p>\n<p>Rembrandt met Saskia while working for her cousin, Hendrick, who was an Amsterdam art dealer. They were married and together for 13 years, until Saskia died. This etching was created after the couple\u2019s second year of marriage.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art and the Dutch Golden Age\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Trade in the Dutch Golden Age brought with it incredible wealth. It was seen as an investment. It also subtly showed the wealth of the owner.<\/p>\n<p>Prints were entry level artworks that allowed new investors to buy, before eventually buying paintings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Rembrandt<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-953\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Rembrandt-Self-Portait.jpg?resize=236%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Rembrandt-Self-Portait.jpg?resize=236%2C300&amp;ssl=1 236w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Rembrandt-Self-Portait.jpg?resize=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 805w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Rembrandt-Self-Portait.jpg?resize=768%2C977&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Rembrandt-Self-Portait.jpg?resize=1207%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1207w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Rembrandt-Self-Portait.jpg?w=1530&amp;ssl=1 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Born in the Netherlands, <strong>Rembrandt van Rijn<\/strong> (1606-1669) was a Dutch Baroque painter and print maker.

The Northern characteristics in this work include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of iconography<\/li>\n<li>Incredible detail<\/li>\n<li>Small-scale works<\/li>\n<li>Interior scenes<\/li>\n<li>Genre scenes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a sense of geometric and mathematical stability. The room uses 1-point perspective. Everything radiates outward from the corner of the painting behind the woman\u2019s hand.\u00a0 Her hand creates a pyramid that extends downward to the tabletop.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Master of Light<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Vermeer was known as the \u201cmaster of light\u201d. The light illuminates the front of the woman\u2019s\u00a0 body as it spread across the room.\u00a0 The subtle use of color softens the light, especially blue and yellow.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Camera Obscura<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The painting does not resolve clearly or come into focus until you reach the subject and her hand.\u00a0 This has led historians to wonder if he was using a <strong>camera obscura<\/strong>. The word means \u201cdark chamber\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This was an ancestor to the photographic camera. <strong>Camera obscura <\/strong>took 3-D works and transformed them into 2D. It requires a viewing lens and viewing screen in a box.<\/p>\n<p>The light has a reflective quality, with distortion. Things are not in focus. A blue tinge\u00a0 was common from the glass and refraction of light. There is no historical evidence to show that Vermeer owned one, but the visual evidence seems uncanny.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of the Work<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The painting urges us to conduct our lives with temperance and moderation lest we be judged. This is known as a <strong>vanitas, or vanity<\/strong> painting. It is <strong>didactic<\/strong> in that it warns us of moral depravity, vanity, and selfishness.<\/p>\n<p>The theme is judging or weighing. The woman is accessing her goods, when it is her own soul that will be weighed or judged. It is actions that matter, not possessions. It urges for a relationship between wealth and spirituality, that encourages a balance between the two.<\/p>\n<p>The Dutch were Protestant and therefore did not shun any display of wealth the way Catholics did, according to Catholic dogma.\u00a0 However, many were concerned that Dutch displays of wealth were becoming too lavish. People were more concerned with worldly possessions than spirituality.<\/p>\n<p>One term coined by art historian Simon Schama for this idea: the <strong>embarrassment of riches.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Content of the Work<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Woman Holding a Balance<\/em><\/strong> is an extremely quiet <strong>genre scene. <\/strong>This is what Vermeer is known for. Women engaged in ordinary domestic activities, with tranquil and luminous interior scenes were frequent in his work.<\/p>\n<p>The woman is pregnant, which is why art historians believe the model to be the artist\u2019s wife Catherina Vermeer. The surroundings are very opulent. She is wearing exceptionally fine clothing, and a typical linen cap that women wore, while at home.<\/p>\n<p>The woman holds in her right hand a balance with nothing on either side yet. The scale is at equilibrium. This is suggestive of her inner state of mind. She seems to be about to weigh the valuables in front of her &#8212; blue cloth, open boxes, two strands of pearls and a gold chain.<\/p>\n<p>A mirror is across from her on the wall. <strong>Mirrors <\/strong>were a common type of <strong>iconography<\/strong> in Dutch Baroque art. They were meant to show vanity, futility, human excess, and concern for the worldly instead of the spiritual. Perhaps this is a <strong>vanitas<\/strong>: reminder of man\u2019s mortality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Last Judgment Painting\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Behind the woman hangs a painting of Christ, who judges over all souls. It illustrates the blessed souls at the bottom left and the damned on the right.<\/p>\n<p>The woman\u2019s head is in a position that it divides the two. This starts the viewer questioning. Which side will she end up on? In the moment, the woman does not seem to notice the lesson or the painting.<\/p>\n<p>Art historians have questioned if this painting, within a painting, really exists, or if it came from Vermeer\u2019s imagination.

Religious art was forbidden and there was no central church to commission it.\u00a0 Instead, a prosperous middle class of merchants collected art and\u00a0 commissioned it.<\/p>\n<p>During the <strong>Dutch Golden Age of the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century<\/strong>,\u00a0 trade and exploration of the New World and Southeast Asia led to Dutch dominance, especially in the <strong>spice trade<\/strong>. This created a tremendous wealth.<\/p>\n<p>There was great anxiety over this wealth. It needed to be used appropriately. Art was displayed in home, so they needed small, intimate works.
