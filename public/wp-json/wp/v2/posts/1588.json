She is well-lit and pushed forward. There is Interest in the line. We can follow the line made by the curve of her back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Idealization and stylization<\/strong> are part of the work. She was painted \u201cideal\u201d and sexual in Ingres\u2019 mind, but this has required an unnatural elongation and stylization of her back. He claimed while painting that \u201che couldn\u2019t stop himself\u201d with her back. In fact, one may argue there are extra vertebrae in her back.\u00a0 He believed a woman\u2019s back was the most sensual part of the body. Additionally, placed her left leg in an impossible position, all to achieve a languidness and sense of curvature.\u00a0 This reminds us of Mannerist elongation. Mannerism was Ingres\u2019 favorite style.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1594\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ingres-Studies-1.jpg?resize=597%2C348&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ingres-Studies-1.jpg?w=597&amp;ssl=1 597w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ingres-Studies-1.jpg?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1595\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ingres-Studies-2.jpg?resize=597%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ingres-Studies-2.jpg?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ingres-Studies-2.jpg?resize=300%2C138&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Compositionally<\/strong>, she is very large and touches nearly all four edges.

Only warm spots are on her back and fan.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Romantic Function<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was commissioned by Caroline Murat, Napoleon\u2019s sister, and Queen of Naples. She was interested in the Middle East, due to Naples\u2019 trade connections with that area. The painting was an experiment with new Romantic ideas using exoticism and eroticism.<\/p>\n<p>It <strong>examines a reclining female nude in a new context<\/strong> that is no longer mythological, but real and exotic. The work also celebrates French imperialism, while objectifying the fetishize of the Orient. The French had a sexual and cultural fascination with this region.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Scandal<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was shown in the Salon of 1819, and it caused a scandal. Viewers were surprised by the frank gaze and sensuality of the nude. This exotic context was new and shocking. There was no way to connect this woman to Venus. Also, the elongation of the body struck viewers as odd.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content: Romantic<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Romantic content has <strong>P.I.N.E\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong> is for <strong>Past <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>I <\/strong>is for <strong>Irrationality\/Insanity<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>N<\/strong> is for <strong>Nature<\/strong>,<\/li>\n<li><strong>E<\/strong> is for <strong>Erotic\/Exotic<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Life in a Harem <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work depicts an odalisque. This is a woman in a harem, as a concubine, companion, and source of entertainment. Ingres had never been in a harem. This was a western\/French fantasy of what a harem would be.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, this is completely inaccurate. The woman in the portrait is a white-washed version of an Oriental woman.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Reclining Female Nude<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work plays into the tradition of the reclining female nude&#8212;going back to Titian. The previous nudes were all said to be Venus, or they could at least be interpreted as Venus.<\/p>\n<p>With Ingres\u2019 <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,<\/em><\/strong> there is no way to interpret her as a Venus \u2013 she is a harem girl. This is <strong>not in a classical setting<\/strong>. This is exotic and <strong>Oriental<\/strong> which at time was commonly used to refer to <strong>Near East and North Africa<\/strong>, not the Far East. Look at the peacock fan, turban, enormous pearls and hookah, a pipe for opium.<\/p>\n<p>Her body is shocking to the viewer. This is not Venus but a girl whose occupation is sex. She isn\u2019t an ideal, imaginary goddess, but she is a real woman! She gazes directly at us. Her body is bizarrely elongated, seemingly rejecting all classical idealization.<\/p>\n<p>Her body is made acceptable to French culture for two reasons. Ingres turns her over and away from the viewer. She is not as pornographic as she could have been. Also, she is geographically distant not a European woman.

In 1814, he traveled to Naples where he was employed by Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, and Napoleon\u2019s sister. Naples, because of its proximity to the Middle East and its connections with trade, was interested in Orientalism and exoticism.<\/p>\n<p>The artist returned to serve as the French Academy\u2019s director, in Rome, from 1835 \u2013 1841<\/p>\n<p>When Ingres painted <strong><em>La Grande Odalisque,<\/em><\/strong> he had started to reject neoclassical subject matter as too stuffy, dull, and arrogant in its moral instruction.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Romanticism: P.I.N.E<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>P stands for past.<\/strong> There was a longing for medieval, pre-industrial Europe, especially about nature.

In <strong><em>Liberty Leading the People <\/em><\/strong>note the contrast and emphasis on Liberty, the clouds behind her are white and grey and do not distract us from her face. This is a pyramidal composition with Liberty at the apex.<\/p>\n<p>The work was completed in <strong>history painting style<\/strong> with a large canvas size and monumental figures. What is unusual however is that the figures are not calm, academic models or even models that are ennobled.

It seemed like it was trying to be a history painting, but this was <strong>not an appropriate subject<\/strong> because it was too modern. Even though one could argue the Marie de\u2019 Medici series was a \u201cmodern history painting,\u201d these had been painted in the Grand Manner, and these figures were gritty, unglamorous, and dead!<\/p>\n<p>The realism of the dead and dirty bodies, combined with the figures\u2019 distance from academic models provoked harsh criticism. Critics said Liberty looked like a prostitute and insurgents looked like criminals.<\/p>\n<p>The French government bought this to remind Louis-Philippe of how he came to power. After the 1848 Revolution, when Louis-Philippe was overthrown, it was taken down for being too inflammatory and kept out of view. Paris was concerned about inciting yet another violent revolution.<\/p>\n<p>The work was moved to the Louvre to exhibit in 1863.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Liberty Leading the People <\/em><\/strong>depicts the <strong>July Revolution of 1830<\/strong>. It uses the conventions of a history painting, but it was painted this the same year the event happened.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marianne <\/strong>is represented as an <strong>allegory<\/strong> or a human who represents a moral or political idea. Here, the idea is Liberty. Here, she wears the Phrygian cap, a classical signifier of freedom from ancient Rome for freed slaves.<\/p>\n<p>Delacroix was inspired by Michelangelo\u2019s nudes for the figure of Liberty. Marianne is monumental, and nude to the waist, in reference to classical nudes.\u00a0 He painted her in yellow to allude to that classical nudity. Vibrant, rebellious, victorious, and fiery, she represents the will of the people. She holds a bayonetted musket in one hand and the tricolor flag in the other.<\/p>\n<p>Men around her represent the different types of people who participate in the revolution.

Look at the enormous, deep red sunset (Turner sunset) over brown sea. The sun seems to slice open the sky. The colors are fiery and rageful. (Imagine what this would look like if David painted this \u2013 far more restrained.)<\/p>\n<p>There is a thick sensuality of paint. This later had a huge effect on modern art.<\/p>\n<p>Clarity and scale are not important here \u2013 Turner is willing to let them go.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In 1840, at the first World Congress meeting of the anti-slavery league (Crown Prince Albert, a well-known abolitionist, was present at this meeting). Turner\u2019s painting was exhibited. Turner was deeply moved by this story and might have wished to impress Crown Prince Albert at this World Congress meeting.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The work was exhibited with lines from a poem that Turner himself had written:<\/p>\n<p><em>Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay, <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Declare the typhon\u2019s coming.

Where is thy market now?<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Transcendentalism<\/strong> is the awe and amazement at the brutal and indiscriminate power of nature.<\/p>\n<p>This work is also a <strong>criticism of society<\/strong> and questions the viewer. Is this worth the profits?<\/p>\n<p>The viewer sees the magnitude of man\u2019s cruelty vs. the magnitude of nature\u2019s power. The moral of the story is that the power of nature is greater than the power of man. Remember, this is during the Industrial Revolution when the arrogance of man (industry, science, technology) is starting to worry people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>PINE<\/strong> (Past, Irrationality\/Insanity, Nature, Emotion\/Exotic) \u00e0 Past, Irrationality\/Insanity, Nature, Emotion<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drama<\/strong> is more important than accuracy. The artist takes liberties by adding in a storm to heighten the drama of the story. Turner was inspired by the Zong, but not documenting it.<\/p>\n<p>There is a sailing ship on the horizon going towards the left. There are body parts, chains, fish, and sea monsters sticking up out of the water. Hands and legs sticking out of the water are dark-skinned. We see chains evident (even though they would not float with these on).<\/p>\n<p>Sea gulls are encircling. Sails of the ship are not unfurled as sea spray flies everywhere.\u00a0 The storm is coming in.<\/p>\n<p>This is an <strong>allegory of the fight of humankind with the elements<\/strong>. Is this a biblical metaphor? Christians often utilized a ship in a storm as a metaphor.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of The Zong <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>The Zong was a British slave ship<\/strong> that sailed for Jamaica in <strong>1783<\/strong>. It was the captain\u2019s last journey and he wanted to collect a great profit for retirement. He sailed with 470 slaves and 17 crew. Many had begun to die from sickness in the Doldrums of the Atlantic (an area where the winds are so calm, there are hardly any winds at all). Seven of the 17 crew died, along with 50 of the slaves.<\/p>\n<p>The slaves got sicker and sicker, and water was running out. The only way to collect insurance on dead slaves and not take a loss is to claim accidental drowning (not sickness). This was intended to encourage captains to treat slaves humanely, by not letting them starve, or not having enough water.<\/p>\n<p>The ship captain doubts the likelihood of them all making it&#8211;not just alive, but healthy enough that he could sell them for a profit. So, he decided to throw them overboard and collect insurance. This way he could collect 30 pounds per slave.<\/p>\n<p>He threw 132 slaves overboard.\u00a0 Most were women and children. Some did not sink and struggled, trying to climb back up on the boat. The crew then attached cannonballs to them and then threw them over.<\/p>\n<p>This left 288 slaves on the boat. These were sold to slave traders in Jamaica for 36 pounds each.<\/p>\n<p>Once in Jamaica, the ship\u2019s owner filed for insurance. The captain said his actions of throwing slaves overboard was the humane thing to do and necessary because of his concerns over lack of water.<\/p>\n<p>The insurance company refused, so the ship owner and captain went to court to make the insurance company pay. The court case was not about the morality of throwing these slaves overboard.<\/p>\n<p>The court ruled in favor of the owner\/captain making the insurers pay 30 pounds per slave.<\/p>\n<p>Judge said: \u201c<em>What is this claim that human people have been thrown overboard? This is a case of goods. Blacks are goods and property \u2013 it is madness to accuse these well-serving men of murder. They acted out of necessity and in the most appropriate manner. The late Captain Collingwood acted in the interest of his ship to protect the safety of his crew. The case is the same as if wood had been thrown overboard<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The case was brought to attention of abolitionists who decried the injustice.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Timeline<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The trip that took 60 days normally ended up taking 108 days.<\/li>\n<li>288 slaves left and 10 crew; down from 470 slaves and 17 crew<\/li>\n<li>1787: Anti-Slavery Committee founded<\/li>\n<li>1807: Parliament prohibited British participation in slave trade<\/li>\n<li>1833: British law prohibits slavery in British Empire<\/li>\n<li>1839: London Times essay re: Zong, poem says ship threatened by storm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Making Comparisons<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1545\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/111-Slave-Ship.jpg?resize=414%2C308&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/111-Slave-Ship.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/111-Slave-Ship.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1475\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=461%2C309&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/211-Under-the-Wave.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Both <strong><em>Slave Ship<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa<\/em><\/strong> depict humans who are at the mercy at nature.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa<\/em>, in <strong><em>Slave Ship<\/em><\/strong>, the humans are in this predicament because of human cruelty.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Works<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Here are some additional <strong>Turner<\/strong> to view<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1616\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/J.M.W.-Turner.-The-Fighting-Temeraire.-1835.-Oil-on-canvas..jpg?resize=700%2C520&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>J.M.W.

This area was not accessible to all women (only well-connected, elite women) and was difficult to see and hear out of. This made the room hot and stuffy and when wearing corsets, some women fainted.

Industrialization unsettled people as modernity seemed ugly. When they looked to the past, it seemed beautiful and traditional. Both were styles associated with the pre-Industrial era and English ingenuity and craftsmanship, even though Gothic wasn\u2019t English, it was adopted in England.<\/p>\n<p>Neoclassicism was popular but was associated with revolution and republicanism. These were associations which Britain did not want to have, as it is one of a few European countries that did not have a revolution in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<p>There were 97 entries that included 91 in Gothic and 6 in Elizabethan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Charles Barry<\/strong>, famous English architect, won the competition. He estimated it would take 6 years to build but took more than 30 years and cost over 2 million pounds back then.<\/p>\n<p>Barry turned to <strong>Augustus Welby Pugin<\/strong>, a 23-year-old architect who was an expert in Gothic style.<\/p>\n<p>Barry designed the overall layout and Pugin added in the decoration on the interior and exterior.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<h4><strong>Early Photography<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>In the nineteenth century, artists and scientists alike <strong>sought a mechanical way to capture an image. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Daguerre<\/strong> is (arguably) the first to come up with a photographic technique.<\/p>\n<p>A debate ensured regarding photography\u2019s artistic merit.

These images are one of a kind, and there is no way to reproduce them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Process<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The artist <strong>took a plate of silver-plated copper<\/strong> and exposed it to <strong>iodine<\/strong> to make it light sensitive. Then he <strong>exposed it to light in the camera<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, this light exposure took about eight hours. Later technology improved and ranged depending on how much light was present. The stronger the light, the less the exposure needed. For example, in the middle of the day there was ample light.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, <strong>mercury fumes<\/strong> would develop. This was stabilized with <strong>salt water<\/strong> (<strong>hypo<\/strong>)*. This step was added after they realized the plates continued to develop through being exposed to light. Many early images have simply turned black.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work was experimentation only and not made for a patron. The artist wanted to make a permanent image using light and chemistry.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art or Science <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A medium of artistic expression? \u00a0A powerful scientific tool? What use could it possibly be for? It could be so easily manipulated and wasn\u2019t powerful enough yet to capture great details or small objects.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Still lifes were common<\/strong>. \u00a0This was not point and click photography! With an exposure time of up to eight hours, anything other than still lifes was difficult to take photos of. \u00a0Even sitting completely still for ten to fifteen minutes without moving was challenging.<\/p>\n<p>The earliest <strong>daguerreotypes<\/strong> were still lifes with plaster casts of antique sculpture. For practical reasons white casts reflected light well. Still lifes were immobile during long exposures.<\/p>\n<p>For <strong>symbolic reasons <\/strong>white casts lent an aura of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cclassicism\u201d to photos and helped to legitimize them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The principle of a camera had been discussed since antiquity, but it wasn\u2019t discovered until 19<sup>th<\/sup> century. Think of Vermeer\u2019s <strong>camera obscura.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9\u00a0Daguerre\u2019s<\/strong> (1787-1852) had been searching since the mid-1820s for a way to take a photo using light and chemistry. By 1829, he showed his new medium at both the Science Academy and Fine Arts Academy in Paris. Even from the start, it was unclear where photography would fit best.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of only about 25 of Daguerre\u2019s images to survive.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EARLY 19th CENTURY ART Theme: \u201cPINE\u201d An acronym to recall the main characteristics of Romanticism, the dominant artistic style in &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-19th-century-art\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Early 19th Century Art<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[10,17],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1588"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1588"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1588\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1708,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1588\/revisions\/1708"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1588"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1588"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1588"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
