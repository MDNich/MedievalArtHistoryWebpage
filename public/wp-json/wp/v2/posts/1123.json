The lands are <strong>continental<\/strong>, <strong>volcanic<\/strong>, and <strong>atollian<\/strong>. Each supports distinct ecologies that exist in relation to the migrations and sociocultural systems that were transported across the region.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patterns of Migration<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Geological and archaeological evidence indicates that Papuan-speaking peoples traveled across a land bridge that connected Asia and present-day Australia about 30,000 years ago. Lapita people migrated eastward across the region beginning 4,000 years ago. Populations sailed from Vanuatu eastward, and carried plants, animals, and pottery. This now demonstrates a pattern of migration and connection from what was the Lapita culture.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting Sail on the Pacific Ocean<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ships and devices of navigation and sailing expertise were built and used to promote <strong>exploration, migration,<\/strong> and the <strong>exchange of objects<\/strong> and cultural patterns across the Pacific. Navigators created personal charts of their experience of the sea. Other objects were intended to protect and ensure the success of sailing. Ocean-going vessels carried families, and often communities, across vast distances. Passengers could also return to their place of departure.<\/p>\n<p>The sea is ubiquitous as a theme of Pacific art. As a presence in the daily lives of a large portion of Oceania, art both connects and separates the lands and peoples of the Pacific.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Variations in Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The arts of the Pacific vary by virtue of ecological situations, social structure, and impact of external influences, such as commerce, colonialism, and missionary activity.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>European Arrival<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The region was explored by Europeans as early as the 16th century and most extensively from the second half of the 18th century. By the beginning of the 19th century, Dumont d\u2019Urville had divided the region into three units: micro- (small), poly- (many), and mela- (black) nesia (island).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Micronesia<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Polynesia<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Melanesia<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1125\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1125\" style=\"width: 1056px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1125\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Pacific-Map.png?resize=990%2C615&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Pacific-Map.png?w=1056&amp;ssl=1 1056w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Pacific-Map.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Pacific-Map.png?resize=1024%2C636&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Pacific-Map.png?resize=768%2C477&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A map showing the various parts of Oceania including Polynesia in green. Image credit: Rainer Lesniewski\/Shutterstock.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h5><strong>A Force of Power<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Arts of the Pacific involve the power and forces of <strong>deities, ancestors, founders<\/strong>, and <strong>hereditary leaders<\/strong>, as well as <strong>symbols of primal principles<\/strong>. These are protected by wrapping, sheathing, and other forms of covering to prevent human access. \u00a0Ritual dress, forms of armor, and tattoos encase and shield the focus of power from human interaction.<\/p>\n<p>One\u2019s vital force, identity, or strength <strong>(mana)<\/strong> is expressed and protected by rules and prohibitions, as well as by wrapping or shielding practices, or <strong>tapu<\/strong>. Mana is also associated with communities and leaders who represent their peoples. Objects that project status and sustain structure hold and become mana. These objects are made secure through tapu or behaviors that limit access to and protect the objects.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Human History and Experience<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Pacific arts are performed&#8211;<strong>danced, sung, recited, displayed<\/strong>&#8212; in an array of colors, scents, textures, and movements. This aids to enact narratives and proclaim primordial truths. Belief in the use of <strong>costumes, cosmetics<\/strong>, and <strong>constructions<\/strong> assembled to enact epics of human history and experience. This is central to the creation of and participation in Pacific arts.<\/p>\n<p>Objects such as <strong>shields, ancestral representations<\/strong>, and <strong>family treasures<\/strong> were and continue to be constructed to give form to and preserve human history and social continuity. Other art forms are constructed to be displayed and performed to remind people of their heritage and shared bonds, such as the significance of an ancestor or leader. These are intended to be destroyed once the memory is created.<\/p>\n<p>Rulers of the Saudeleur Dynasty commanded <strong>construction<\/strong> of Nan Madol in Micronesia, a residential and ceremonial complex of numerous human-made islets. Rulers of Hawaii were clothed in <strong>feather capes<\/strong> that announce their status and shield them from contact. Societies of Polynesia in New Zealand, Rapa Nui, and Samoa create <strong>sacred ceremonial spaces<\/strong> that both announce and contain their legitimacy, power, and life force. In Melanesia, individuals and clans earn status and power and sustain social balance in a set of relationships marked by the <strong>exchange of objects<\/strong>. Masks, and the performance of <strong>masks<\/strong>, are a recital and commemoration of ancestors\u2019 histories and wisdom.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art as Commerce<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A barter system in art exists in communities, in which one set of objects is exchange for something equally as valuable. The process of exchange is complex and prescribed. Chants, dances, scents, costumes, and people of a particular lineage and social position are called into play to create a performance. This verifies the significance exchange.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(9) 216. Staff god. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Oceanic (Rarotonga). Late 18<sup>th<\/sup>-early 19<sup>th<\/sup>.
