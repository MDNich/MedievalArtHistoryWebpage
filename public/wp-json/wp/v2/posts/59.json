The art of dynastic Egypt (present day <strong>Egypt and Sudan<\/strong> from 3000 to 30 BCE) includes <strong>pre-dynastic Egypt<\/strong> and <strong>Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Amarna period (New Kingdom)<\/strong> was important because of its cultural reform and stylistic revolution. Artistic innovations and conventions (canons) provide a foundation for subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>The art of dynastic Egypt embodied a sense of permanence. It was created for eternity and focused on preserving a cycle of rebirth. The culture represents an elaborate funerary sect whose devotees created <strong>ka statues<\/strong> to house the spirit after death. They also created <strong>artifacts, decorations<\/strong>, and <strong>furnishings for tombs. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Egyptian art incorporated <strong>mythological<\/strong> and <strong>religious symbolism<\/strong> often centered on the cult of the sun.<\/p>\n<p>Development of monumental <strong>stone architecture<\/strong> culminated with the pyramids and innovative designs for rock-cut tombs and pylon temples, each demonstrating the importance of the pharaoh &#8211; a god-king with absolute power, descended directly from the sun god.<\/p>\n<p>The Egyptian architectural construction of <strong>the clerestory<\/strong> is important for the history of architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Representations of humans made clear distinctions between deified pharaohs and lower classes, using <strong>hierarchical proportion<\/strong> and idealization versus naturalism. The artistic canon of dynastic Egypt, with strict conventions of representation, use of materials, and treatment of forms, was followed for centuries with only short-lived periods of experimentation and deviation.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Theme: \u201cTombs, Temples, Timelessness\u201d<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This theme reminds us that much of Egyptian art was created for <strong>tombs or temples<\/strong>.

Different from cuneiform, hieroglyphs were pictures instead of simplified symbols.<\/p>\n<p>The word \u201chieroglyph\u201d comes from the Greek word for \u201csacred carving.\u201d Greek scholars in the 1st century B.C.E. gave the writing this name because the examples they found were chiseled into the walls of temples and public monuments.<\/p>\n<p>The ability to read hieroglyphics was lost until 1799 C.E., when French soldiers uncovered an unusual stone tablet in the Egyptian town of Rosetta. The stone was covered with three distinct registers of engraved lines. Scholars recognized the writing on the bottom as Greek and would use this as a reference for decoding the hieroglyphs.<\/p>\n<p>The writing at the top\u2014hieroglyphic writing\u2014was a mystery. Was it to be read right to left, left to right, or vertically? By comparing text on the Rosetta Stone to hieroglyphics on temple walls and monuments, researchers discovered that a cartouche surrounding hieroglyphics indicated a name. The names of kings and queens were among the first translated.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Rosetta Stone<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The same text is written in three different languages.<\/li>\n<li>Key to the modern decoding of hieroglyphics<\/li>\n<li>Discovered during Napoleon\u2019s 1799 excursion to Egypt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_312\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-312\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-312\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Rosetta-Stone.jpg?resize=400%2C759&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"759\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Rosetta-Stone.jpg?w=176&amp;ssl=1 176w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Rosetta-Stone.jpg?resize=158%2C300&amp;ssl=1 158w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Drawing of Rosetta Stone<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 13.

At the time, there was no Egyptian word for queen. Just king\u2019s wife or king\u2019s mother. She was daughter of Thutmose I, and wife\/sister of Thutmose II who died. No legitimate heir was old enough to rule. Hatshepsut took the throne over her nephew\/stepson Thutmose III. She gradually increased her role of regent to that of pharaoh.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_274\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-274\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=400%2C724&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"724\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?w=169&amp;ssl=1 169w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Kneeling-statue-of-Hatsheput.jpg?resize=166%2C300&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-274\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kneeling statue of Hatshepsut<br \/>Image \u00a9 The Metropolitan Museum of<br \/>Art\/Image source \u00a9 Art Resource, NY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>She claimed an oracle had predicted she would be pharaoh and that she was born from the gods. No knowledge of how she died or was superseded was ever found. We do know that Thutmose III destroyed many records about her after her death.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Worshipping the Sun God<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This temple was built for Hatshepsut, so she could worship Amun-Rae, the sun god. Originally the gardens were planted with trees and 200 sculptures.<\/p>\n<p>One of the sculptures that would have been in the garden was <strong><em>The Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsu<\/em><\/strong>t. The large granite sculpture shows the ruler kneeling for the sun god. An inscription on the work says she is making an offering.<\/p>\n<p>Hatshepsut is dressed in the costume of male pharaohs, with a royal headdress and false ceremonial beard. Although she appears topless, her breasts are de-emphasized, and her shoulders are wide. To be displayed as a pharaoh meant <em>to <\/em>be displayed as male. She followed through with this as she wanted to convey her royal authority.<\/p>\n<p>Today, this sculpture is on display at the Metropolitan Museum in NYC.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function of Mortuary Temples<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Temples were places kings worshipped their own patron gods. When the kings died, people would worship them there.<\/p>\n<p>This temple was political propaganda for Hatshepsut.

This important canyon is where for 500 years during the time of the New Kingdom royals and nobles were buried.<\/p>\n<p>The Valley was considered sacred to the principal feminine goddess associated with the funeral world, Nephthys. If Old Kingdom is known for pyramids, then New Kingdom is known for rock-cut tombs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Valley of the Queens <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A new necropolis in Thebes, Egypt, during the reign of Rameses 1 (1292- 1291 BCE) was built to use for burials of royal family members. It was called The Valley of the Queens, but ancient Egyptians called it Ta Set Neferou or The Place of Beauty. The Valley of the Queens is located near the Valley of the Kings.<\/p>\n<p>Several expeditions were carried out that revealed very little. Then, in 1903, an archeological team for the Museo Egizio, in Turin, Italy, led by Ernesto Schiaparelli, had three successful digs. The largest discovery was that of <strong>Queen Nefertari, Great Royal Wife of Ramesses II<\/strong>. The rock cut tomb was discovered at the base of the mountain, along with the tomb of princess Ahmose, and four of the king\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1138\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/PaC_Reines_Egypte_04.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1138\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/PaC_Reines_Egypte_04.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>Queen Nerfertari was the first royal spouse, hence the title and the favourite of the pharaoh.

The 134 columns made were from sandstone. Most of the columns are 22 feet high, except for the twelve columns in the centre are 62 feet tall. This allows for <strong>clerestory lighting<\/strong> or light to filter in from outside.

Many historians believe Aton, or sun, who they worshipped, was believed to be both male and female. If \u00a0Akhenaton was the son of the sun, then he would be dominated by both genders.<\/p>\n<p>This distinguished new art from Egypt\u2019s past.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Chosen Couple<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Above them the rays of God Aten shine down.

The queen\u2019s throne is decorated with lotus flowers, which symbolizes the unification of Egypt. <strong>Hieroglyphics<\/strong> on the top and around the figures explain the worship to Aton.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Backgrounder<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work signifies a style break in art, as Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten, who ruled from 1353- 1336 BCE changed the religion and started to worship God Aten.<\/p>\n<p>Pharaoh Amenhotep IV abandoned the worship of the Egyptian gods in favor of Aton, whom he declared to be universal and only god, identified with the sun.\u00a0 He changed his name to be Akhenaton (\u201cAton is pleased\u201d). He had the names and images of other gods from temples defaced.<\/p>\n<p>There were no priests\u00a0 in this new religion. Akhenaton was Aten\u2019s son and his representative on earth.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Analysis and Comparison of \u00a0<em>Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and three daughters<\/em> and <em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and three daughters<\/em><\/strong> is a bas-relief carving in limestone measuring 32.5 cm in height and depicting King Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti holding their three young daughters. It was created in the 18th dynasty in Ancient Egypt, around 1350 BCE.<\/p>\n<p>The bas relief is representative for <strong>Amarna period<\/strong> in which royalty and the solar divinity Aten are closely connected. This breaks with a three thousand of years of consistent art representation, by making the pharaoh and his family the only ones favored by the new god Aten.<\/p>\n<p>The artifact is intended to be <strong>part of a household altar<\/strong>, and so it <strong>had both religious and decorative purposes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The adult figures are presented in a <strong>composite view<\/strong> (profile view of the face, but the shoulders face the viewer exposing more of the body) , which is typical of Ancient Egyptian carvings, and they sit on low stools facing each other, which emphasizes their close marriage relationship. The inclusion of the three daughters <strong>signifies the importance of family<\/strong>, not just for the continuation of royal lineage, but also in the context of the Egyptian home where the altar would have been used.<\/p>\n<p>The image is distinctive not only because it represents <strong>a shift from polytheism to the monotheistic worship of the sun god Aten<\/strong>, but mainly because it is informal. The pharaoh Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti seem to be captured playing with their children. The pharaoh supports his daughter head almost ready to kiss\/hug her, while she points to her mother the queen, who at her turn holds two of her sisters. One is pointing to the pharaoh and one playing with her mother earring.<\/p>\n<p>The anatomy of the <strong>pharaoh with a slight belly<\/strong> is a departure from the perfect anatomy of the Egyptian classical representation. The anatomy of the three daughters\u00a0 with their <strong>round bellies, elongated heads<\/strong> <strong>and members<\/strong> is also a departure from the rectilinear classical forms associated with the old religion of Amon.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>iconography<\/strong> shows the sun disk with a cobra inside as a symbol of only one god replacing the entire Egyptian pantheon. The central position of the sun highlights the supreme importance of Aten, and its rays offer the royal family ankh signs, which signify life (Egyptian Museum Berlin, 1), while offering only hands in rest.<\/p>\n<p>Remarkably, the symbols of both Lower and Upper Egypt\u00a0 are not placed on the pharaoh, but under Nefertiti\u2019s chair symbolizing that she is queen of both and that <strong>the couple ruled together<\/strong>. After the death of Nefertiti the religion returned to the cult of Amon. Images dating from the Amarna period were destroyed. This limestone piece is a survivor.<\/p>\n<p>The encaustic icon of\u00a0 <strong><em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George<\/em><\/strong> is a painting dating from dates from the sixth or early seventh century CE of the Byzantine Empire. Situated in St. Catherine&#8217;s Monastery, Sinai, Egypt, this Byzantine icon uses wax as a medium to carry the color and it is one earliest surviving images of the Theotokos, i.e. \u201cMother of God\u201d, an image that dominated Byzantine art and influenced the cult of the Virgin in both Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-527\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/54-Virgin-Theotokos-and-Child.jpg?resize=506%2C720&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/54-Virgin-Theotokos-and-Child.jpg?w=218&amp;ssl=1 218w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/54-Virgin-Theotokos-and-Child.jpg?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The icons were images which served as a devotional aid, focusing the attention of Christians on the key relationships between G-d and human beings. The values that are highlighted here are: a hierarchical world view in which G-d is omnipotent, served by angels who worship him, Mary who brings to the world the Messia in the form of the infant Jesus, saints who assist her and the infant Jesus. Such images of Christ and Marie were controversial in the Byzantine Empire, theologists being concerned that the people venerated the images and not G-d.<\/p>\n<p>In the 8th century the emperor Leo the II the Syrian forbade the use of icons. During this period icons were destroyed by the iconoclasts, \u201cicon breakers\u201d, so this icon is a survivor similarly, to the <strong><em>Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and three daughters<\/em><\/strong>.\u00a0 The resemblance between\u00a0 the two images continues at a symbolic level.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George<\/em><\/strong> is also an image centered the figure of\u00a0 G-d of a monotheistic religion, the Christian one. While Christ is also placed centrally in the arms of Saint Mary, G-d\u00a0 is symbolically represented by a hand situated at the top and centre of the image, radiating out to the rest of the picture. The mother and child take a lower position, and all characters have haloes, i.e. golden circles of light around their heads, which denotes their holy status. Mary, the archetypal mother, sits on a golden throne, holding her child, which hints at a queenly role for her, and kingship for him, albeit of a spiritual kind. The crosses held by the two male saints are another symbol, representing the death and resurrection of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The image is far away from the natural representation of the pharaoh\u2019s family.\u00a0 The eyes of the saints and of Mary are piercing, but\u00a0 they do not make eye contact between themselves or with the viewer. Theodore and George gaze forward beyond the viewer, and Mary looks slightly down as if they were preoccupied by something else. The bluish, nearly transparent angels in the third row turn their heads towards G-d. The light emanating from G-d ends on Mary\u2019s halo reminding the viewer that Christ was the incarnation of G-d through Mary. Only the angels seem to make eye contact with the onlooker in agreement with their religious role of intercessors on behalf of the believer.<\/p>\n<p>Both artifacts <strong>act as a bridge between the human and the divine<\/strong> in their respective cultures. Both <strong>show a single deity<\/strong> through abstract and symbolic means, and they have rather flat, two-dimensional human figures. The arrangement of figures from top to bottom underlines the order of the cosmos in each society, while eye contact of the angels\u00a0 draws the viewer in <strong><em>Virgin (Theotokos) and Child between Saints Theodore and George<\/em><\/strong> much more than in the earlier <strong><em>Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and three daughters<\/em><\/strong> to suggest a more direct relationship with G-d, while the leisure pose of\u00a0 <strong><em>Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and three daughters<\/em><\/strong> suggests a joyful religion with less restrictions on its believers.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 23.Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, innermost coffin <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Egyptian (New Kingdom, 18<sup>th<\/sup> Dynasty). 1,323 BCE.

Sand caused a great deal or decay to bodies, so preservation required many intricate steps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Priests, who were the embalmers set the body upon a large table that look very much like a lab table today. Here, in only a room in which they were allowed, the priests performed various gesture and incantations over the body.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The body was then washed with a mineral powder made with hydrated sodium carbonate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is when the extraction of the brain would incur, by using a metal hook, inserted through the nostrils.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Incisions were made to extract the organs including the kidney, lungs, large blood vessels and esophagus.

I walk in my sleep through earth and heaven.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5><strong>How are the quote and the artwork related?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Using specific visual and contextual evidence while referencing both the quote and the work shown, let\u2019s analyze how both the quote and the artwork reflect the Egyptian views of death and afterlife.<\/p>\n<p>The quote suggests that the journey of the soul towards Osiris was not straightforward. Demonic crocodiles, snakes could trick or attack the soul in the underworld. Even while trying to save his own soul, the scribe continued to perform good deeds and protect his father.<\/p>\n<p>The quote illustrates how <strong><em>The Book of Dead<\/em><\/strong> prepared the deceased for what awaited him\/her in the Underworld, providing the soul with the spells driving away the dangers. The elaborated <strong>texts and illustrations <\/strong>complement each other and allow us to better understand the beliefs of the ancient Egyptian civilization.<\/p>\n<p>The artwork depicts the main hurdle a deceased person must overcome, for example the weighing of the heart. In the Hall of Truth, the deceased is judged by a court chaired by <strong>Osiris<\/strong>, whose life-giving power\/rebirth associated with the Nile River. Before the 42 god who asses his life a crouched Hu-Nefer allegedly describes his good life.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment begins with the reception of the deceased by <strong>jackal-headed god Anubis<\/strong>. Anubis holds in his hand an <strong>ankh<\/strong> the symbol of the eternal life that might be awarded to Hu-Nefer. In the center stands the scale having on a tray, the heart of the deceased, and a feather on the other. If the heart is pure, the balance remains in balance and the deceased can access the paradise. The feather belongs to the goddess of order Maat who appears at the top of the scale.<\/p>\n<p>Around the scales are represented the gods <strong>Anubis and Thoth<\/strong>. God of the scribes, the latter notes the results of the weighing. A strange monster with a crocodile head, lion paws and hippopotamus hindquarters called <strong>&#8220;the devourer&#8221;<\/strong> also appears near the scales ready to devour the heart of Hu-Nefer?<\/p>\n<p>After the Judgement, the ankh is passed to <strong>Horus the falcon-headed god<\/strong>, who introduces Hu-Nefer in another room in which sits Horus\u2019 father, <strong>Osiris.<\/strong> The most important god of the Egyptian pantheon Osiris is enthroned, sits on a throne surrounded by <strong>Isis and Nephthys<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In front of Osiris blooms a lotus flower the symbol of eternal life on which stay the children of Horus who are depicted on all canonic jars carrying the organs of a deceased.<\/p>\n<p>The text and the artwork show that both chaos and order determined a soul journey through afterlife and that one needed to both live an ethical life and to educate himself\/ herself in order to gain eternal life.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Other Objects Often Found in Tombs<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1116\" style=\"width: 577px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1116 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Funerary-stela-of-the-craftsman-Nakhi.jpg?resize=577%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Funerary-stela-of-the-craftsman-Nakhi.jpg?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Funerary-stela-of-the-craftsman-Nakhi.jpg?resize=192%2C300&amp;ssl=1 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Funery stela of the craftman Nahki.

Made from limestone or wood, they were carved, painted, or sometimes both. A stela was most commonly found in two places: inside a tomb, or inside a funerary chapel so loved ones could honor the dead. \u00a0On a stela the deceased was represented in a pictorial image, usually in front of an offering table full of food, with their names and any titles included.<\/p>\n<p>During the time of the Old Kingdom, a stela was a rectangular shape that stood horizontally. Later, they were placed vertically, and it became fashionable to have a rounded top.<\/p>\n<p>The example above is from Museo Egizio, in Turin, Italy. Made from sandstone, the object stands 100 by 63 by 15 centimetres. It was made for a craftman named Naki and it is thought to be from the region of Deir el-Medina, which was well regarded for their artistry.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>How to Read An Egyptian Stela<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A stela is set up in registers with each depicting a different scene.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Top Register<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>On the top left with the jackal head is the god Anubis. Notice the ankh he is holding. This will assist in guiding the deceased to the afterlife. Just in front sits Osiris the ruler of the Netherworld. He is the symbol of rebirth, as the first said to have risen after being killed by his brother. See how the hieroglyphics tell the story above each character. Nakhi stands in front of a table with offerings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Center and Bottom Register <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Nakhi and his wife are sitting together. The large cones on their head are perfume cones and are considered a sign of status.\u00a0 On the table in front are items the deceased will require. The many children line up to give symbols of resurrection to their parents.<\/p>\n<h4>EGYPTIAN EXTRAS<\/h4>\n<h5><strong>Objects for Beauty in Ancient Egypt<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1085\" style=\"width: 582px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1085 \" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Egyptian-Mirror-2.jpg?resize=582%2C874&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Egyptian-Mirror-2.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Egyptian-Mirror-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Egyptian-Mirror-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Egyptian-Mirror-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Egyptian-Mirror-2.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mirror with Handle in the Form of a Hathor Emblemca. 1479\u20131425 B.C. New Kingdom @ Metroplitan Museum of Art.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h5><strong>Upon Further \u00a0Reflection<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Mirrors<\/strong> were made from bronze, copper, and silver, but did not contain glass. This would not appear until Roman times.\u00a0 The metal provided the reflection.\u00a0 The handles were decorative and would often contain images of Hathor the goddess of love and beauty.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mirror with Handle in the Form of a Hathor Emblemca<\/strong> from 1479\u20131425 B.C. at the Metropolitan Museum of art in New York, is a fine example of a mirror in ancient Egypt, New Kingdom. Originally made of wood, It was <strong>covered in gold foil<\/strong>. The use of precious metals indicates it was for the elite. It has been traced back to Thutmose II belonging to one of his three wives.<\/p>\n<p>The woman face on the top of the handle has the large ears of a cow. This represents the goddess Bat, but is also a symbol for Hathor.<\/p>\n<p>The woman&#8217;s face with cow&#8217;s ears represents the goddess Bat and is also an emblem of the goddess Hathor. The use of gold and silver, rather than wood and bronze, identifies this as the possession of a member of the elite, in this case one of three foreign wives of Thutmose III. The king&#8217;s cartouche is inscribed above the face.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Time To Make Up<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Small stone vessels were the perfect storage space for <strong>face washing creams and moisturizers<\/strong>. These beauty essential skin softeners were made from a combination of vegetable oils and animal fat along with fragrances.<\/p>\n<p>The Smith papyrus has a recipe for a face cream using the main ingredient fenugreek.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you know that both men and women used foundations in the form of powder?<\/strong> It was used on both the face and body to whiten them. The predominate ingredient was ceruse. Foundations or base makeups were stored in round stone jars.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kohl or black eyeliner<\/strong> was stored in long tubes (After it was ground and mixed on a palette!) Often made of reed and wood, glass containers were reserved for the elite. There are only 500 glass kohl containers known in existence.\u00a0<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1086\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Container-for-Kohl.jpg?resize=1%2C1&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Eyeliner helped to define the eye. Due to its antibacterial functions, it also prevented infections, which were common due to sand, the drying elements of the air and the beating sun.<\/p>\n<p>Long deep spoons were used to store various <strong>coloured blush powders<\/strong>. Examples of spoon materials found include wood or ivory. The handles were often carved into elongated images. Naked swimmers, ducks or water lilies were popular choices.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of such a spoon<strong>. <\/strong><strong>Cosmetic Spoon in the Shape of Swimming Woman Holding a Dish<\/strong> 1390\u20131352 BCE (New Kingdom)\u00a0 The object is made from Travertine (Egyptian alabaster) and steatite.
