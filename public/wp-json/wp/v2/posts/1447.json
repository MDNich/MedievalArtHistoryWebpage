Vast cultural interchanges have occurred in these lands that link the European and Asian peoples.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Heart of the Silk Route<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Historical cultures of <strong>West and Central Asia<\/strong> reside in a vast area that includes the <strong>Arabian Peninsula and the Levant, Anatolia, Greater Iran, Central Asia, Inner Asia, and Himalayan Asia<\/strong>. These regions have had shifting political boundaries throughout their histories and include lands associated with the former Soviet Union and modern China. They form the heart of the ancient Silk Route. \u00a0This connected the Greco-Roman world with China and India.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>An Exchange of Cultural Ideas<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Arts attest to the transmission and influence of cultural ideas, such as <strong>Islam <\/strong>and <strong>Buddhism<\/strong>. It also includes cultural art forms, such as <strong>Hellenistic architecture<\/strong>, <strong>Buddhist sculpture<\/strong>, <strong>chinoiserie<\/strong> (in Persian art), and <strong>ceramic-tile decoration<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Cross-cultural comparisons with the arts of these regions may be made most readily to the arts of the ancient Mediterranean; medieval Europe; and South, East, and Southeast. The arts of West and Central Asia had great international impact through trade.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Domination of Textiles<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Textiles were perhaps the most important art form in these regions and dominated much of the international trade between Europe and Asia.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Other Works<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Islamic metalworks<\/strong>, including examples with Christian subject matter, were created for trade in the regions bordering the Mediterranean.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ceramics<\/strong> were another important trade item, particularly the Iznik wares created in TurkeyAsia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>West Asian art<\/strong> finds its greatest source of refinement and international influence in the Persianate arts from the Timurid and Safavid dynasties of Iran, which influenced the Ottoman arts of Turkey and the Mughal arts of India. Styles of art in Central Asia can be divided into <strong>Persianate Islamic styles<\/strong>, which maintain developments made in West Asian art, and <strong>Indian inspired styles<\/strong>, which are characterized by the idealized figural art traditions of South Asia.<\/p>\n<h5>Figural Art<\/h5>\n<p>Use of figural art in religious contexts varies among traditions, whereas figural art is common in secular art forms across West and Central Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Figural art is a primary form of visual communication in Buddhist communities in Central Asia, as it is across Asia. Figural imagery is used to depict <strong>Buddha<\/strong> and various attendants, teachers, practitioners, and deities. This is an <strong>iconic culture<\/strong>, and the presence of invoked figural imagery is important to Buddhist practices. These figures may be venerated in <strong>shrine settings<\/strong>, may inhabit conceptual <strong>landscapes <\/strong>and <strong>palaces<\/strong> of ideal Buddhist worlds, may be found in <strong>mandalas<\/strong>, or may be depicted in <strong>paintings<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sacred Versus Secular Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Islamic art<\/strong> that is created for <strong>religious purposes<\/strong> does not contain figural imagery. Mosque architecture is decorated with <strong>non figural imagery<\/strong>, including calligraphy, geometric, and vegetal forms. Manuscripts or objects containing sacred texts may contain calligraphy, illumination, or geometric and vegetal decoration, but should not contain figural imagery.<\/p>\n<p>Figural art is an important subject of <strong>Islamic art in West and Central Asia<\/strong>. Islamic cultures draw a clear distinction between sacred and <strong>secular contexts<\/strong>. Figural imagery abounds in secular works, such as decorative arts and manuscript painting, which often depict sociological types, such as hunters or courtiers, or narrative subjects, such as the ancient kings and heroes of the Persian Shahnama.<\/p>\n<p>Religious ideas or content are sometimes carried over into secular art forms and may be illustrated when they become the subject of courtly or popular literature and poetry. For example, the prophet Moses might be illustrated in the Khamsa of Nizami. Moses would not be illustrated, however, in the holy Qur\u2019an.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(7) 181.

Located in a rocky basin, Petra is accessed by a deep road called Siq. Geographically, the site is located 150 miles south of both Amman, the capital of Jordan and Jerusalem.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Background History<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Nabatean people had settled in southern Jordan by 312 BCE.\u00a0 Ideally placed at the Northern end of the Caravan Route that ran from South Arabia to the Mediterranean, the people were great traders during the late Hellenistic and Early Roman Periods. The commerce of luxury products such as frankincense and myrrh, that was burned at alters, as well as spice, contributed to a wealthy society.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Romans <\/strong>invaded during 106 CE and changed the name to Arabia Petrae. Here, they ruled for 250 years, until an earthquake destroyed the buildings. The <strong>Byzantines <\/strong>would take control later and govern for another 300 years. Petra was mostly abandoned however, by the eight century CE.<\/p>\n<p>Referred to as the Rose City, because of the color the stone appears, Petra was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 1985.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Initially, historians thought Petra was a large necropolis or cemetery. The architecture proves otherwise, uncovering what was once an active and well-developed metropolis.<\/p>\n<p>With talented architects the community transformed the rocky desert into a great city through innovative constructions. Engineers turned the dusty land into a garden oasis by using an elaborate water system through damming, terracing, and irrigation. This was used to harvest, store, and distribute water collected during the rainy season.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Treasury Fa\u00e7ade<\/strong><\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1450\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1450\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1450\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/181-Petra-B.jpg?resize=600%2C721&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"721\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Treasury<br \/>\u00a9 Bernard Gagnon<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The most famous building is the <strong>Treasury (or Khazneh)<\/strong>.
