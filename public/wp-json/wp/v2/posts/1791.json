Most materials came from the site or broader area.\u00a0 It is central and natural with an <strong>in situ <\/strong>stone core for the fireplace.<\/p>\n<p>The color palette is limited:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>light ochre (yellowy tan)<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCherokee red\u201d based on natural rock color<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is a <strong>liberal use of glass<\/strong>. The house has no walls facing the waterfall. <strong>Corner-turning windows<\/strong> do not use mullions and create unbroken views of nature. <strong>Elongated horizontal windows<\/strong> encourage the viewer to look outside.<\/p>\n<p>The architecture creates the Illusion that the stream flows through the house. The powerful falls is heard from every room.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>ceilings are low<\/strong> reaching only up to 6 feet and 4 inches. \u00a0This encourages you to move towards the windows for the feeling of openness.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>floor is polished with wax<\/strong> to give it the appearance of wetness.<\/p>\n<p>The house is darkest at the entrance and gets lighter as you move towards the back by the windows.<\/p>\n<p>The use of <strong>cantilever<\/strong> construction allowed <strong>Wright<\/strong> to hang the house over the falls. Cantilever is a long projecting beam that has reinforcing wire-mesh and steel bars embedded inside of it to increase tensile strength. He used reinforced concrete or <strong>ferroconcrete.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Edgar Kaufmann Sr, the Pittsburgh department store tycoon, commissioned <strong>Wright<\/strong> to build <strong>Fallingwater.<\/strong> Kaufmann sent a copy of <strong>Wright\u2019s<\/strong> blueprints to his personal engineer who found the ground of <strong>Fallingwater<\/strong> unstable and dimensions of the cantilever untenable. He did not recommend that <strong>Wright <\/strong>proceed with the house. The architect was upset but permitted an increase in the number and diameter of the structure\u2019s steel reinforcements.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This was created as a <strong>private home<\/strong> and weekend retreat for the Kaufmann family.<\/p>\n<p>The clients were very interested in modern art and <strong>Wright\u2019s<\/strong> work.

It was the time of the <strong>Great Depression<\/strong>. Almost no private homes were built.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wright<\/strong> and his wife were struggling to keep Taliesin, his studio\/home, out of foreclosure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wright<\/strong> was also being viewed by his contemporaries as \u201cout of style\u201d. In a review of architecture in 1932, he was criticized for his \u201cunwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Philip Johnson, the designer of the Seagram Building, would call <strong>Wright<\/strong> the \u201cgreatest architect of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century\u201d to jab at how old and outdated he was.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wright <\/strong>developed an apprenticeship program called \u201cthe fellowship\u201d to create business. Edgar Kaufmann Jr. was one of his first apprentices.<\/p>\n<p>Kaufmann Sr. asked Wright about making a summer home for his family. They owned a large chunk of property in this area but the spot with the waterfall was their favorite. \u00a0<strong>Wright <\/strong>visited the site in December 1934. He rejected a conventional view of the waterfall and wanted to make the house a part of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wright <\/strong>procrastinated for 9 months until Kaufmann Sr. called and said he was driving 140 miles to Taliesin to see what Wright had done.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Apprentice Edgar Taffel said: <em>Wright briskly emerged from his office, sat down at the table with the plot plan and started to draw. The design just poured out of him. \u2018Lilian and Edgar will have tea on the balcony\u2026they\u2019ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods\u2026\u2019 Pencils were being used up as fast as we could sharpen them.

Then, the title across the bottom was scribbled: \u2018Fallingwater.\u2019<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The whole process took two hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wright<\/strong> was influenced by <strong>Transcendentalism<\/strong> meaning all nature and humanity are connected.

It focuses on his artistic failures and sexual impotency. It is his reckoning with his own weakness. His frustrations with his artistic, masculine, militaristic, and sexual inadequacy are captured.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Kirchner is<\/strong> <strong>dressed in a military uniform<\/strong>. It is not in a military context however, as he is in his studio. There is a number 75 epaulets on his shoulders. This indicates his membership in the 75<sup>th<\/sup> Field Artillery Regiment. Symbols on his cap represent the German Reich.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kirchner<\/strong> appears sallow, harsh, edgy, angular, yellow, and sickly. He holds a limp cigarette in his mouth in reference to his physical and sexual inadequacies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kirchner <\/strong>has an amputated arm that is bloody. This is a symbol of his inadequacies. The amputation is a metaphor for his \u201cartist\u2019s block\u201d. He felt like he couldn\u2019t create, and when he did, it was not well-received.<\/p>\n<p>What about the nude that stands behind him almost like a statue? The figure is very different from the fleshy, attractive, inviting bodies we have seen in <strong>Venus of Urbino<\/strong> and <strong>La Grande Odalisque<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, <strong>Kirchner<\/strong> stands in his studio with everything he would need to make love and make art, and instead he can do neither.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Timeline<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In <strong>1905 <\/strong>Kirchner helped found the German Expressionist group <strong>Die Br\u00fccke<\/strong> (The Bridge). They believed they would be a bridge to the future. They promoted an entirely new way of being an artist. The focus was on distorted, jagged forms and color to display emotion.<\/p>\n<p>Die Br\u00fccke artists were interested in \u201cprimitive\u201d art, particularly from Africa. They believed \u201cprimitive\u201d art was honest, direct, and purer than art from Western industrialized nations. Obviously, this is not a politically correct notion, but it had a huge impact on Expressionism. Die Br\u00fccke artists wanted to adopt the \u201cnatural\u201d state they saw in \u201cprimitive\u201d art.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>1913<\/strong> Die Br\u00fccke disbanded. It was two years before this painting was created.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>1914<\/strong> Kirchner volunteered to be a driver in WWI. He did this to avoid being drafted in a more dangerous combat role. He suffered a mental break down and was diagnosed as an alcoholic and barbiturate addict. He was discharged.<\/p>\n<p>The artist returned to Berlin to paint but suffered a nervous breakdown again. Then, he lived in two mental institutions. He became severely addicted to alcohol and morphine. For a time, his hands and feet were paralyzed, and his limbs did not function as they should have.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being well-received internationally (some argue he is as important, if not more so, than Picasso), <strong>his art was rejected by Hitler in the 1930s. <\/strong>Hitler persecuted artists who painted in a style that was outside of his \u201cAryan ideal\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Degenerate Art Show in 1937<\/strong> was held by Hitler. He exhibited all modernist art he hated and 32 of the works were Kirchner\u2019s. Hitler had over 600 of Kirchner\u2019s works removed from public collections. Many were destroyed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kirchner shot and killed himself in July of 1938. <\/strong>He tried to get his girlfriend to do it with him. She refused and they had a huge fight. He went outside and shot himself in the heart.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 132. <em>Improvisation 28 (second version). <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Wassily Kandinsky.

He was very opposed to WWI.<\/p>\n<p>Liebknecht formed the Berlin Spartacus League which printed an illegal newspaper called the Spartacus Letters (from the name Spartacus after the slave who led a failed revolt against the Roman Army in 73 BCE). Spartacus League essentially became the German Communist party.<\/p>\n<p>In 1916 the Spartacists called for an end to the war. Liebknecht was arrested and spent the rest of the war in prison. In 1918 he was released when amnesty was granted to all political prisoners.<\/p>\n<p>In 1919 a German Revolution (aka Spartacus Revolt) was attempted. It was the Spartacus League vs. the government of Friedrich Elbert. The revolt was defeated with ease by Elbert\u2019s Germany army.\u00a0 \u00a0Liebknecht was murdered, after being held in a hotel room, before being transported to prison.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kollwitz <\/strong>was the first woman accepted into the Prussian Academy of Arts (she received a studio, an income, and a professorship).<\/li>\n<li>In political turmoil after WWI, many artists turn to prints as an ideal medium for spreading political statements.<\/li>\n<li>German Expressionism grew as a reaction to WWI: exhibiting the disjointed, broken, jagged society that remained.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><strong>Cubism (1907-1930s) <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Cubism was inspired by C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Post-Impressionistic works.

It moves towards absolute pure abstraction. There is an asymmetrical balance and total flatness. The image is simplified and non-representational. There is absolute abstraction without any reference to objects in nature.<\/p>\n<p>The painting has no individual brushstrokes. This is very difficult to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow <\/em><\/strong>uses pure primary colours of white, black, red, blue and yellow.

As a result of WWI, people had been so torn apart that they needed something to unite them.<\/p>\n<p>Mondrian felt that pure abstraction was the only relevant, clear, and universal language.

She painted almost 200 self-portraits.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Two Fridas <\/em><\/strong>was completed during her divorce from Diego Rivera.<\/p>\n<p>She married Rivera in 1929. They each had affairs. Kahlo\u2019s affairs were with men and women.<\/p>\n<p>Kahlo\u2019s father was German, and her mother was Mexican. Rivera encouraged her to abandon her Germanic\/Western heritage and wear traditional Mexican clothing instead.<\/p>\n<p>In an era when women wore elaborate hairstyles and clothing, Kahlo was a rebellious loner who wore indigenous clothing and did not shave. This was seen as very transgressive. During this time most women were domestic housewives. Kahlo was a businesswoman and artist.<\/p>\n<p>In her paintings she often depicted physical deformities. She had polio as a child, which deformed her right leg. A bus accident when she was 18 caused her to be impaled through her groin which left her unable to walk for many months. Ultimately, she was unable to have children. She had severe scarring and deformity of the uterus. As a result, she underwent 32 operations. All these things challenged the definition of femininity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 138. <em>Object (Le D\u00e9jeuner en fourrure). <\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Meret Oppenheim.

We are not in an urban or civilized area, but an untamed wilderness. Lam paints <strong>sugarcane and tobacco<\/strong> which are domesticated plants. Sugarcane is alien to the jungle setting, rather, it is grown in fields.<\/p>\n<p>So why the Jungle? It captures the exotic, wild Western fantasy of tropical Cuba and reduces its inhabitants to strange, mystical hybrids who are not fully \u201ccivilized\u201d.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Originally enslaved by Spanish and Portuguese traders, Africans were forced to work sugarcane fields and convert to Catholicism. Africans continued to practice their native religion in the safety of jungles and fields.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1940s in Cuba, <strong>sugarcane<\/strong> was big business. It required the toil of thousands of laborers. The reality of Cubans engaged in hard labor was in sharp contrast to how foreigners experienced the island as a tropical playground. While Americans enjoyed Cuba as a resort experience, US corporations ran their sugar businesses. The US controlled Cuban policies for decades.<\/p>\n<p>Lam painted this after returning to Cuba from a trip to Europe where he was introduced to <strong>Surrealism. <\/strong>Surrealists aimed to unleash the unconscious mind. This freed things that have been suppressed.

The plate is <strong>dipped in a succession of etching acid baths<\/strong>, which eat away at the darker areas of the plate which have more gelatin. Next, the artist <strong>prints the image with ink.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Why would you use this? It is <strong>one of the best methods to mass produce large editions of photographs<\/strong> that are good quality. They have a very sensual velvety feel.<\/p>\n<p>This is a study of composition, shape, rhythm, value, and line. Photography can capture abstraction in the same manner that painting can.<\/p>\n<p>The artist explains:<\/p>\n<p><em>A round straw hat, the funnel leading out, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railings made of circular chains \u2013 white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0I stood spellbound for a while, looking and looking. Could I photograph what I felt, looking and looking and still looking? I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life. [\u2026] <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Spontaneously I raced to the main stairway of the steamer, chased down to my cabin, got my Graflex, raced back again all out of breath, wondering whether the man with the straw hat had moved or not. If he had, the picture I had seen would no longer be. The relationship of shapes as I wanted them would have been disturbed and the picture lost.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>But there was the man with the straw hat. He hadn\u2019t moved. The man with the crossed white suspenders showing his back, he too, talking to a man, hadn\u2019t moved. And the woman with a child on her lap, sitting on the floor, hadn\u2019t moved. Seemingly, no one had changed position. [\u2026] [It] would be a picture based on related shapes and on the deepest human feeling, a step in my own evolution, a spontaneous discovery.<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Stieglitz\u2019s<\/strong> function was to argue for the <strong>elevation of photography to a fine art<\/strong>. It was an argument for <strong>photography\u2019s merits. <\/strong>The <strong>emphasize was on how photography is different than painting. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Considered the first modernist photograph \u2013 why? Prior to this, photographers had tried to always emulate painting (think of <em>Still Life in Studio<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Photography\u2019s strengths are clarity and realism. This was the first photo that did not aim to emulate painting in style and subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>There was an unintended function. It became associated with Documentary Photography and journalism. It also conveyed a message about its subjects and immigrants, even though this wasn\u2019t Stieglitz\u2019s intent.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Upper and lower-class immigrants and travelers together on a boat<\/li>\n<li>Formal arrangements of diagonals, colors, tones<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Stieglitz <\/strong>ran an art gallery and published many art journals, that focused on photography<\/p>\n<p>He was familiar with the debates about immigration reform and the ghastly conditions that steerage passengers were subjected to. Interestingly, Stieglitz, the son of a German immigrant, was opposed to admitting the uneducated and marginal to the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Stieglitz\u2019s wife Emmeline and their daughter were going to France. Emmeline was from a wealthy family, and Stieglitz was very class-conscious. Here is what he had to say about it.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>How I hated the atmosphere of the first class on that ship. One couldn\u2019t escape the &#8216;nouveau riches.&#8217; [&#8230;] On the third day out I finally couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. I had to get away from that company. I went as far forward on the deck as I could [&#8230;]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0As I came to the end of the desk I stood alone, looking down. There were men and women and children on the lower deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading up to the upper deck of the steerage, a small deck at the bow of the steamer.\u00a0To the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage deck there was fastened a gangway bridge which was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone. On the upper deck, looking over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck. Only men were on the upper deck. The whole scene fascinated me. \u00a0<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EARLY 20th CENTURY Theme: \u201cAbstraction\u201d Cutting-edge artists made figures abstracted and made them the center of the canvas and composition. &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/early-20th-century\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Early 20th Century<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[10,17],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1791"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1791"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1791\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1850,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1791\/revisions\/1850"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1791"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1791"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1791"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
