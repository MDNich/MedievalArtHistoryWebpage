The marble works were cut away from the stone behind.<\/p>\n<p>An interest in nudity was prevalent in Greek art. Egyptian art only portrayed children naked.

Today, throughout the Unites States, you will see buildings that are based on Greek works, such as a city hall, theatre, bank, or library. One of the main things that draws the eye to these classical styles are columns. These includes <strong>Doric, Iconic and Corinthian columns.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All three varieties or <strong>orders<\/strong>, share the same fluted column or <strong>drum<\/strong>. The top is called the <strong>capital. <\/strong>\u00a0This is where each column is different. <strong>Doric<\/strong> is the simplest variety with a tapered disc supporting a square top. <strong>Iconic<\/strong> has curls on the top. <strong>Corinthian<\/strong> is a fancy filigree that looks like a symmetrical plant trying to grow. This varies and takes on many ornate forms.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>basic Greek temple<\/strong> is a rectangular shaped building with a long, angled roof.\u00a0 This peaks to form a triangle called a <strong>pediment.<\/strong> These areas were adorned with life sized sculptures.<\/p>\n<p>The roof rests upon an even plane called an <strong>entablature<\/strong>. This spanned the gaps between columns and\u00a0 provided a solid surface. As temple buildings became more advanced, the entablature was decorated with what was called <strong>metopes.<\/strong> These were separated by three lines called <strong>triglyphs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Later still, as temples became bigger, a second row of columns was added and decorated along the top in what is called <strong>frieze<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>ARCHAIC PERIOD: 600- 400 BCE<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Greek city-states, especially Athens, grew and flourished, particularly in the arts.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Sculptures<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em>Kouros <\/em>and <em>Kore<\/em>: grave monuments<\/p>\n<p>Sculptures from temples<\/p>\n<p>Marble; bronze (hollow); limestone; terra cotta; wood; gold<\/p>\n<p>Often painted.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Pottery<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Potters and vase painters began to sign their works.<\/p>\n<p>Black-figure; red-figure; white ground.<\/p>\n<p>Stiffness and monumentality.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Doric and Ionic orders of architecture emerged.<\/p>\n<p>Roofed, columnar, stone temples.<\/p>\n<p>Altars were positioned in the east end of temples.<\/p>\n<p>Temples were shrines to hold the cult statues and votive offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Temples were built on elevated sites.<\/p>\n<p>Canonical plan\u2014order, compactness, symmetry.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 27.

The torso and limbs have greater anatomical accuracy. The figures are more rounded and there is swelling in the hips, calves, abdomen, and cheeks.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Archaic Kouros characteristics<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Pose: left leg out with weight evenly split (just like Menkaure)<\/li>\n<li>Sharp shins<\/li>\n<li>Heavily delineated abs<\/li>\n<li>Traditional braiding of the hair with traditional headband<\/li>\n<li>Archaic smile (figure transcends this world; nobility; knowledge of the peace of the afterlife)<\/li>\n<li>Hands are stuck to the sides creating a sense of stability and even rigidity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These sculptures were used <strong>offering to the gods <\/strong>as<strong> grave markings<\/strong>, as this one was.\u00a0 It also comes with an inscription:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStay and mourn at the monument of the dead Kroises who raging Ares slew as he fought in the front ranks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This signifies that the young man Kroises, was killed in war, as Aries was the god of war. This was the most noble way to die, and these men were considered heroes.<\/p>\n<p>Kouros could also be gods. The most frequently portrayed was Apollo.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Comparing the Athenian Kouros<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>An Athenian <strong>Kouros<\/strong> is identified in several ways. It is nude, muscular, has braided hair worn down, and arms by its side. With a single step forward, it reveals sharp knees. The kouros always has an Archaic smile.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast the <strong>female kore<\/strong> is never nude. She is depicted as soft and never muscular. Her braided hair is also worn down and her hands are in fists by her side. Her legs are not visible, and she does not step forward. She also wears an archaic smile.<\/p>\n<p>The Athenian kouros figure shares qualities with <strong>Egyptian statuary<\/strong>. It has even weight, a single step forward, arms down by side and an idealized, muscular body.<\/p>\n<p>PHOTO OF EGYPTIAN SCULPTURE<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(2) 28.

Then, it needs to be covered with wax.\u00a0 The wax clay model is put inside a clay case. A hold is cut at the bottom. Next, the model is heated.\u00a0 The wax will drip out and leave a small space between the clay interior and the clay case.<\/p>\n<p>Once complete, the artist tips the entire work upside down so that the hole faces upward and pours in liquid bronze.

It glorified Athena Parthenos, the later word meaning virgin, which was highly valued in Athenian society. The goddess was an enforcer of such modesty. The Panathenaic Procession was a celebration of Athena\u2019s birthday.<\/p>\n<p>The north side was the temple of earlier sects and dedicated to earlier gods. The south side contained temples dedicated to Athena. All Athenians citizens were able to take part in the festivals. Only priests were allowed inside.<\/p>\n<p>The building was also a celebration of the Greek victory over the Persians, while showcasing the Athenian wealth and power.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Build<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The front and back look the same, which was entirely intentional.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marble<\/strong> at the time was cheap and available. The roof was originally made with wood and capped with marble tiles. It would have been brightly painted at the time, so viewers could easily see and interpret the decorations.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Architectural \u00a0Focus<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Peripteral<\/strong> temple is a temple with a <strong>colonnade <\/strong>on all four sides and based on <strong>peristyle<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The types of orders or columns used in this building are <strong>Doric and Ionic<\/strong>. <strong>Doric <\/strong>was used for is the exterior, with fluted shafts, simple <strong>capitals<\/strong>, and <strong>entablature<\/strong> of <strong>triglyphs<\/strong> and <strong>metopes<\/strong>. <strong>Ionic <\/strong>was used is the interior and used fluted shafts, <strong>volute<\/strong> capitals, with an entablature of frieze.<\/p>\n<p>It was very unusual to combine orders. Art historians believe this was to show a united Greece, with the Doric representing the mainland style and the Iconic the preferred style of the Greek islands.<\/p>\n<p>The building\u2019s <strong>pediment, <\/strong>a\u00a0triangular\u00a0part\u00a0at the\u00a0top\u00a0front of the building that supports the roof was highly carved.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Series of Optical Illusions<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Adjustments were made in the architecture to compensate for optical illusions. A <strong>stylobate <\/strong>or continuous base supporting the row of columns curves upward from the center, as does the <strong>entablature<\/strong>. This acts to deflect the appearance of sagging in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Columns lean inward slightly. If the lines were continued, they would all meet 1.5 miles above the temple. Columns are not evenly spaced to prevent the look of them being clustered.\u00a0 <strong>Entasis <\/strong>is a slight convex curve in the shaft of a column. The columns bulge out in the middle, and this works to give the illusion that they are straight and taper upward.<\/p>\n<p>The columns in the corners were often surrounded by light. This made them look thinner. To remedy this, the columns here were made 2 inches thicker.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>A Visual of Strength<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>All decorations are a symbol of strength. The <strong>metopes<\/strong> between the channeled <strong>triglyphs <\/strong>are carved. The west metopes are depicted with Amazonomachy, a mythical battle between the Amazons and Ancient Greeks. The east metopes illustrate the mythical battle between the gods and giants called Gigantomachy. The northside shows the Trojan war, while the south represents Centauromachy, the battle between the mythical centaurs with the Lapiths.<\/p>\n<p>The pediments too provide stunning visuals. The east shows the birth of Athena, while the west is all about Poseidon vs Athena.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>cella<\/strong> or main room housed a massive <strong>chryselephantine <\/strong>statue of Athena, made from gold and ivory. She was fully armed with a shield, spear, and helmet. In her hand, she held Nike, the winged personification of Victory.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Notable Architectural Element at The Parthenon<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-334\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Drawing.jpg?resize=446%2C540&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"446\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Drawing.jpg?w=446&amp;ssl=1 446w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Drawing.jpg?resize=248%2C300&amp;ssl=1 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Doric Exterior<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Triglyphs and Metopes<\/li>\n<li>Doric capitals with no base<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Ionic Interior<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entablature contains a continuous frieze.<\/li>\n<li>Iconic capitals with no base<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Column Spacing<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not evenly spaced to give an illusion of even spacing<strong>.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Entasis<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted the bending look of columns using a bulge or entasis to make them look straight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Corner Columns<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built to be 2 inches thicker at the corner to counteract the slimming illusion from light.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-336 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Column-Drawings-1.jpg?resize=963%2C722&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"963\" height=\"722\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Column-Drawings-1.jpg?w=963&amp;ssl=1 963w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Column-Drawings-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Column-Drawings-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Partheon-Column-Drawings-1.jpg?resize=755%2C566&amp;ssl=1 755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Backgrounder<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The<strong> Parthenon <\/strong>was converted into a Byzantine church, then a Catholic church, in the Middle Ages.

For this event, the citizens of Athens honor Athena, by weaving a peplos. Six <strong>Ergastines,<\/strong> or young aristocratic women in charge of weaving the peplos, are greeted by two priests. They all walk in procession towards the Parthenon.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>new theory<\/strong> suggests it could be the depiction of the legendary Athenian king, <strong>Erechtheus<\/strong>, who sacrificed one of his daughters to save the city of Athens. An ancient wooden idol of the goddess Athena was said to have fallen from the skies during his reins. The sacrifice was under the guidance of Oracle of Delphi.<\/p>\n<p>With either theory, the mood of the artwork is sombre as the people wear grave expressions. It shows the religious piety of the upper class, and Athenians at large.
