The museum became an important institution of civic and national status and pride. The <strong>sale of art to the public<\/strong> became the leading driver of art production. The collection of art increased, driving up prices, as art became a commodity that appreciated in value. After the devastation of Europe in World War II, artists in the United States dominated the art market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Audiences ranged from private patrons to the public<\/strong>, who were sometimes hostile toward art that broke with tradition.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Artist in Charge<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artists were initially bonded by sanctioned academies and pursued inclusion in juried salons for their work to be displayed. The influence of these academies then receded in favor of radical individualism.<\/p>\n<p>Some artists worked without patronage. Some joined together in self- defined groups. These were often on the margins of the mainstream art world. Published manifestos of their beliefs were part of artistic life.

It was known for simplification of brushstrokes and the removal of transitional tones.<\/p>\n<p>This work was displayed at the 1865 Salon (for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the national school of art after the Revolution disbanded the Academie Royale des peintures et sculptures).<\/p>\n<p>Viewers weren\u2019t sure of <strong>Manet\u2019s <\/strong>motives.<\/p>\n<p>Was he trying to produce a serious work of art?<\/p>\n<p>Was he trying to continue the great art historical tradition of female nudes?<\/p>\n<p>Was he honoring Titian? If you wanted to become a great painter, you had to contend with the Old Masters.\u00a0Was Olympia a parody of Titian\u2019s <em>Venus of Urbino<\/em>?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reaction was very negative<\/strong>. The public was so outraged by the painting that the gallery was forced to hire two policemen to protect the canvas. Objections had more to do with the realism of the subject than the fact that she was nude. She was not a Venus, not a wife, not even an odalisque (even <em>La Grande Odalisque<\/em> was acceptable because she was exotic and foreign!) This was a woman you could run into in the city of Paris!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manet was trying to capture modern life.<\/strong> Here he paints a woman of his time \u2013 not a feminine ideal, not a goddess, but a real prostitute.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Art for Art\u2019s Sake <\/strong>the phrase that wasn\u2019t coined until 1875, after this painting was made is indeed still relevant. \u00a0JM Whistler, an American painter, in a court trial is credited with coming up with the phrase. He expressed the inherent value in art, even if it lacks a moral, historical, or didactic message.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content: IMPRESSIONISM<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>How is this Impressionism?<\/strong> This is a scene of modern life, not necessarily the downtrodden who are exploited and toiling on the side of the road. Granted, many of us today would say prostitutes are exploited \u2013 however, from what we see of Olympia, she is a stable, well-off woman. We must remember the context of the period.<\/p>\n<p><em>Olympia <\/em>depicts a reclining nude woman, with a maid and black cat, gazing at the viewer.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Olympia<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Olympia is a prostitute (a common prostitute name in Paris).

It was called \u201cinconceivable vulgarity\u201d despite the Impressionists loving it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manet<\/strong> is the bridge between Realism and Impressionism. This was a new beginning of artists becoming interested in modern Parisian life. There was something uniquely urban, sensational, and chic about modern Parisian life that deserved to be captured.<\/p>\n<p>Impressionists departed from tradition by rejecting perspective, balanced compositions, chiaroscuro, and modeling. They desired sensation from color and light. There was a lack of finish to their work as well as individual technique.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Manet<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00c9douard Manet (1832-1883)<\/strong> was a member of Paris\u2019s upper-middle class (bourgeoisie). The artist was the only one of his contemporaries who didn\u2019t have to sell his paintings to earn a living. Although his father wanted him to study law, <strong>Manet<\/strong> still preferred art. <strong>Manet<\/strong> loved Courbet, Velazquez, and Goya.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Everything is mere appearance, the pleasures of a passing hour, a midsummer night&#8217;s dream.

Remember, this is during the Industrial Revolution when the arrogance of man (industry, science, technology) is starting to worry people.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>PINE<\/strong> (Past, Irrationality\/Insanity, Nature, Emotion\/Exotic) \u00e0 Past, Irrationality\/Insanity, Nature, Emotion<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drama<\/strong> is more important than accuracy. The artist takes liberties by adding in a storm to heighten the drama of the story. Turner was inspired by the Zong, but not documenting it.<\/p>\n<p>There is a sailing ship on the horizon going towards the left. There are body parts, chains, fish, and sea monsters sticking up out of the water. Hands and legs sticking out of the water are dark-skinned. We see chains evident (even though they would not float with these on).<\/p>\n<p>Sea gulls are encircling. Sails of the ship are not unfurled as sea spray flies everywhere.\u00a0 The storm is coming in.<\/p>\n<p>This is an <strong>allegory of the fight of humankind with the elements<\/strong>. Is this a biblical metaphor? Christians often utilized a ship in a storm as a metaphor.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Story of The Zong <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Zong was a British slave ship that sailed for Jamaica in <strong>1783<\/strong>. It was the captain\u2019s last journey and he wanted to collect a great profit for retirement. He sailed with 470 slaves and 17 crew. Many had begun to die from sickness in the Doldrums of the Atlantic (an area where the winds are so calm, there are hardly any winds at all). Seven of the 17 crew died, along with 50 of the slaves.<\/p>\n<p>The slaves got sicker and sicker, and water was running out. The only way to collect insurance on dead slaves and not take a loss is to claim accidental drowning (not sickness). This was intended to encourage captains to treat slaves humanely, by not letting them starve, or not having enough water.<\/p>\n<p>The ship captain doubts the likelihood of them all making it&#8211;not just alive, but healthy enough that he could sell them for a profit. So, he decided to throw them overboard and collect insurance. This way he could collect 30 pounds per slave.<\/p>\n<p>He threw 132 slaves overboard.\u00a0 Most were women and children. Some did not sink and struggled, trying to climb back up on the boat. The crew then attached cannonballs to them and then threw them over.<\/p>\n<p>This left 288 slaves on the boat. These were sold to slave traders in Jamaica for 36 pounds each.<\/p>\n<p>Once in Jamaica, the ship\u2019s owner filed for insurance. The captain said his actions of throwing slaves overboard was the humane thing to do and necessary because of his concerns over lack of water.<\/p>\n<p>The insurance company refused, so the ship owner and captain went to court to make the insurance company pay. The court case was not about the morality of throwing these slaves overboard.<\/p>\n<p>The court ruled in favor of the owner\/captain making the insurers pay 30 pounds per slave.<\/p>\n<p>Judge said: \u201c<em>What is this claim that human people have been thrown overboard? This is a case of goods. Blacks are goods and property \u2013 it is madness to accuse these well-serving men of murder. They acted out of necessity and in the most appropriate manner. The late Captain Collingwood acted in the interest of his ship to protect the safety of his crew. The case is the same as if wood had been thrown overboard<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The case was brought to attention of abolitionists who decried the injustice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Timeline<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The trip that took 60 days normally ended up taking 108 days.<\/li>\n<li>288 slaves left and 10 crew; down from 470 slaves and 17 crew<\/li>\n<li>1787: Anti-Slavery Committee founded<\/li>\n<li>1807: Parliament prohibited British participation in slave trade<\/li>\n<li>1833: British law prohibits slavery in British Empire<\/li>\n<li>1839: London Times essay re: Zong, poem \u00e0 says ship threatened by storm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(4) 119. <em>The Burghers of Calais<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Auguste Rodin.

The correspondence reveals that the Calais mayor tried to keep Rodin\u2019s interest in the project despite their disagreements and delays.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>patrons were so disappointed<\/strong>, they did not want to purchase it. They wanted one statue of Eustache since he was the council leader of the burghers. And where was the pedestal?<\/p>\n<p>They did not like that the men were unidealized and emotional. They thought this display of male emotion was inappropriate, and made them look vulnerable and weak, instead of ennobled.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rodin gave them a version with a pedestal<\/strong> to satisfy them. Then, <strong>he made a second version without a pedestal for himself.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The patrons were still so disappointed, they did not order additional castings like they had discussed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>One Moment in Time<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Look at the choice in <strong>the moment of the narrative<\/strong> (have not discussed this since Baroque art!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rodin<\/strong> does not show these men when they were released. Instead, he shows them in the moment they gather to go to their deaths. We see them in agony. Instead of elating the men in the moment of full knowledge that they will not die, he shows us that the threat of death is very real.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Men<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Six men appear \u2013 these are the <strong>burghers<\/strong> (councilmen) of Calais. They are wearing only simple tattered sackcloth (<strong>King Edward humiliated them by making them wear sackcloth<\/strong> to reinforce his power over them). The clothing anchors them to the ground. There is no escaping their fate.<\/p>\n<p>They appear <strong>thin and malnourished<\/strong>. The city had been besieged for 11 months. The man with the beard is <strong>Eustache de Saint-Pierre.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The men stand together, but they do not make eye contact or interact with one another. Each is reflecting on their own choice and their own sense of loss.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some have their heads bowed.<\/li>\n<li>Some raise their hands.<\/li>\n<li>Others gaze out into the distance (one with key to the city: Jean d\u2019Aire).<\/li>\n<li>Some plea.<\/li>\n<li>They are united then not through contact but by their posture and circumstance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Warring and Death<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Calais was besieged for 11 months with dwindling food and water.

He was very opposed to WWI.<\/p>\n<p>Liebknecht formed the Berlin Spartacus League which printed an illegal newspaper called the Spartacus Letters (from the name Spartacus after the slave who led a failed revolt against the Roman Army in 73 BCE). Spartacus League essentially became the German Communist party.<\/p>\n<p>In 1916 the Spartacists called for an end to the war. Liebknecht was arrested and spent the rest of the war in prison. In 1918 he was released when amnesty was granted to all political prisoners.<\/p>\n<p>In 1919 a German Revolution (aka Spartacus Revolt) was attempted. It was the Spartacus League vs. the government of Friedrich Elbert.

The image was <strong>not preconceived<\/strong>. It was the result of the creative process and the artist\u2019s impulse.<\/p>\n<p>This was the reaction to WWII and American regionalism. There was a feeling of despair.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Willem De Kooning<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Willem de Kooning (1904-1997) <\/strong>was born in the Netherlands. In 1926, he arrived in America, penniless and unable to speak English.

The red lipstick was originally meant to be deflated when the platform was not in use and inflated to get students\u2019 attention.<\/p>\n<p>The work was a satirical comment on the Vietnam War with hawkish, hyper-masculine rhetoric of the military verses a feminine tube of lipstick. It was <strong>a comment on masculinity and femininity<\/strong> with the traditional masculinity of war (hard, gritty, violent) verses traditional femininity of lipstick (sensual, soft, alluring).<\/p>\n<p>The inclusion of lipstick in this work also took on an additional meaning in <strong>commemoration of Yale becoming a coeducational university<\/strong>.
