Although prehistoric Europe has been the focus of many introductions to the history of art, early art is found worldwide. It shares certain features, particularly in concern with the natural world and humankind\u2019s place within it.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Before the Written Record<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The analysis and interpretations of art from this period are especially important, as little-to-no written evidence exists for such early works. Art historians develop theories, in collaboration with social and physical scientists, to understand art historical developments.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Climate and Environment<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Periods before the written record are often defined in terms of geological eras or major shifts in climate and environment. Human behavior and expression were influenced by the changing environments in which they lived.\u00a0 A glacial period produced European ice ages. Saharan agricultural grassland became desert. Tectonic shifts, in southeast Asia, created land bridges between the continent and the now-islands of the Pacific, south of the equator.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Macrocosmic and Micro Cosmic Awareness<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In many world regions, including those not in direct contact with one another, art shows humans\u2019 awareness of fundamental, stable phenomena.\u00a0 Astronomical cycles, such as equinoxes and solstices have frequently been a factor in the influence of art from a macrocosmic perspective. \u00a0On a smaller scope, microcosmic influences, including the exploitation of permanent materials available in local environments, such as <strong>stone<\/strong>, <strong>hardened<\/strong> <strong>clay<\/strong>, and <strong>jade<\/strong>, are all determining factors in early creation.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Defining the Stone Ages<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The periods of global prehistory are known as lithic or stone ages. These include Paleolithic (\u201cOld Stone Age\u201d), Mesolithic (\u201cMiddle Stone Age\u201d), and Neolithic (\u201cNew Stone Age\u201d). Each period brought with it culture depicted in art.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paleolithic Period or Old Stone Age<\/strong> (40,000 BCE\u201310,000 BCE)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mesolithic Period or Middle Stone Age<\/strong> (10,000 BCE\u20138,000 BCE)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Neolithic Period or New Stone Age<\/strong> (8,000 BCE\u20133,000 BCE)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Hunter-Gatherers Survival and Art (Paleolithic Period\/ Old Stone Age)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>40,000 BCE\u201310,000 BCE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Globally, the earliest peoples were small groups of hunter-gatherers, whose paramount concern was sheer survival. This resulted in the creation of <strong>practical objects<\/strong>. Stone tools were fashioned and used to <strong>cut, scrape, carve<\/strong> and <strong>kill<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>From earliest times, these practical tools were accompanied by objects of unknown purpose\u2014<strong>ritual and symbolic works<\/strong>, perhaps intended to encourage the availability of flora and fauna food sources. These works included large cave drawings, but also, small moveable, primitive sculpture art. Made from <strong>clay, bone, ivory, <\/strong>and <strong>stone,<\/strong> a popular theme during this time was <strong>Venus art<\/strong>, or figurines <strong>representing female fertility<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art As A Community (Mesolithic Period\/ Middle Stone Age)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>10,000 BCE\u20138,000 BCE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During this period, people began to settle in communities. This resulted in more <strong>human depictions<\/strong> in artworks. As humans began to find their home, domesticated pets were added, such as the dog. Sculpture became more sophisticated, and clay was now finished by firing.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Art Depicting Stone Age Life (Neolithic Period\/New Stone Age)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>8,000 BCE\u20133,000 BCE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During the Neolithic period society began to advance. The earliest forms of architecture emerged. Farming was a way of life now, with the domestication of plants and farm animals.<\/p>\n<p>Art making was associated with activities such as food production. Think <strong>hunting, gathering, agriculture<\/strong>, and <strong>animal husbandry<\/strong>. It also illustrated patterns of behavior, such as <strong>settlement<\/strong>, demonstration of <strong>status<\/strong>, and <strong>burial<\/strong>. For example, places of gathering or settlement and\/or objects found in such places may be painted and\/or incised with imagery related to their use.<\/p>\n<p>Sophisticated <strong>weaving <\/strong>was found in fabric for clothing. Art was increasingly stylized and continued to show more craftsmanship.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(1) 1.<em> Apollo 11 Stones<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Prehistoric African (Namibia). 25, 500 BCE to 25, 300 BCE.
