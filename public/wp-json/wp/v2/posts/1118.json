Works of art from this region are <strong>often performed<\/strong>, and the experience is central to the creation of and participation in them.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Social Life and Culture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The arts of the Pacific are <strong>expressions of beliefs and social structure<\/strong>, which are strong forces in the social and cultural life of this region. Art and art making in this region is influenced by many things, and <strong>physical setting and available materials<\/strong> can be important considerations that affect artistic decisions and creations. Pacific arts are often distinguished by materials including <strong>sea ivory<\/strong>, seashell, tortoise shell<strong>, wood, coral, stone<\/strong>, <strong>fiber, pigment,<\/strong> and <strong>bone. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These objects are <strong>carried, exchanged, and used<\/strong> by peoples of the region.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Creating a Response<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Objects and behaviors in the cultures of the Pacific are often designed and presented to stimulate a particular response. Rare and precious materials are used to <strong>demonstrate wealth<\/strong>, <strong>status, and particular circumstance<\/strong>. <strong>Ritual <\/strong>settings are structured to address all the senses. Physical <strong>combat and warfare<\/strong> are announced and preceded by displays of ferocity in dress, dance, verbal aggression, and gestural <strong>threats<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(9) 215. <em>\u2018Ahu \u2018ula (feather cape)<\/em>. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Oceanic (Hawaiian).

Tiny bundles of feathers were attached to the netting in overlapping rows starting at the bottom edge. The fiber base to which the feathers are attached was considered sacred. The knotted cords were associated with the wearer\u2019s lineage which could be traced back to the gods.<\/p>\n<p>These capes often have 500,000 feathers. Some of the feathers used came from birds that only had seven usable feathers on their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Other groups in Oceania make feather capes but the Hawaiian <strong><em>\u2018Ahu \u2018ula<\/em><\/strong> is unique in its crescent shape and arced feather designs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Hawaiian male nobility (<strong>ali\u2019i<\/strong>) or Hawaii\u2019s ruling elite, wore feather cloaks and capes for ceremonies and battles. This was a sign of status, gender, bravery, and honor. Cloaks were used for physical and spiritual protection (<strong>mana<\/strong>) in battles. <strong>Mana <\/strong>is a supernatural power associated with people of high rank. By appearing in the guise of gods, Hawaiian chiefs would have sought to intimidate their enemies.<\/p>\n<p>As feathers needed to make the capes became scarce, and members of the ali\u2019i began requiring feathers as tribute. The length and complexity of the capes conveyed not only the <strong>mana<\/strong> of the wearer, but also a sense of how many people and territories the wearer controlled.<\/p>\n<p>These capes showed a clear visual relationship between themselves and the gods. Red was a divine color.\u00a0 The bodies of Hawaiian gods were thought to be covered with bird feathers, so when an ali\u2019i wore a feather cloak, his body was enveloped in feathers just like the body of a god.<\/p>\n<p>This reflects the lineage of the wearer since they were made for individuals. Patterns includes symbols relating to a clan and have been described as heraldic. When capes were being produced, artists recited the \u00a0genealogy of the wearer during the construction of the cape. Weaving the story of the family and the individual into the garment increased the mana in the cape.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Meaning<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u2018Ahu \u2018ula<\/strong> \u00a0means red garment and is used to refer to feather capes. The length of the cape reflected the status of owner. A person of a lower status owned this one. This is a small cape and would wear more like jacket length.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Color<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Red was associated with both gods and chiefs. It was the color of divinity and only worn by royalty. Yellow was the sign of wealth because yellow feathers were rare, due to their scarcity.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Birds <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The red feathers came from the \u2018i\u2019iwi bird and the apapane bird. Yellow feathers came from the \u2018o\u2019o bird.<\/p>\n<p>Most birds naturally lose and replace their feathers regularly throughout their lives. Since feathers are naturally recurring, like human hair, they usually grow back after being pulled out.<\/p>\n<p>It was believed that when in flight, the proximity of birds to the sky meant they could fly between this world and the spirit world, where gods and ancestors reside.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About the Capes<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>These capes were worn by men and made for specific individuals. They were not passed down through a line of succession. The wearer did not select or commission the pattern.<\/p>\n<p>Chiefs would appear in feather capes and similarly feathered helmets at ceremonies and battle. Every time the feather cape was worn, it acquired more <strong>mana. <\/strong>If a chief conquered another chief, the victor could incorporate the design of the fallen chief\u2019s feather cape into his own, thereby appropriating the fallen chief\u2019s mana. Additionally, it was considered a commemoration to use previous ruler\u2019s feathers.<\/p>\n<p>Large numbers of feather cloaks and capes were given as gifts to European sea captains and their crews&#8211; who were the earliest visitors to Hawaii\u2014but they were not created for the purpose of gift giving. Often, these were then regifted from sailors to the patrons, who financed their voyages.<\/p>\n<p>It is unknown who brought this particular cape to England.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(9) 217.
