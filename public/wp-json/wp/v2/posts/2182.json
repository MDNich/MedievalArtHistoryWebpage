An Indian monk painted in the Buddha\u2019s eyes, symbolically imbuing it with life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daibutsu<\/strong> is Japanese for Giant Buddha.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Buddhism in Japan<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century via Silk Road traders.<\/p>\n<p>It quickly became associated with the Imperial Court and the elite showed status this way.<\/p>\n<p>During the 8th century Emperor Shomu promoted Buddhism across the state and built Todai-ji for the Kegon sect of Buddhism (earliest form of Japanese Buddhism). This was part of a large building project where he ordered temples, monasteries, and convents to be built throughout Japan\u2019s 66 provinces.<\/p>\n<p>In the 12th century, during the rebuild, there was the Gempei Civil War between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto clan won as the Buddhists from Todai-ji had allied with them.<\/p>\n<p>Taira clan burned the site in 1180 as retaliation. The destruction shocked Japan.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Rebuild<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Minamoto elite contributed funds to rebuilding it and then looked like benefactors.<\/p>\n<p>The Buddhist priest Chogen was placed in charge of reconstruction. He made three trips to China to observe what Song China was doing artistically.<\/p>\n<p>In 1700 Buddha was redone.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Traditional Joint Block Technique<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>For <strong>wood sculptures,<\/strong> the joint block technique (yosegi zukuri-multiple-block technique) of creating sculpture was introduced, in the latter half of the 10th century. This was due primarily to the lack of large trees and a growing creative impulse to create gigantic statues. First it was developed for seated sculptures by a Fujiwara sculptor, Jocho. Later the Jocho\u2019s style of statues was extended for standing statues.\u00a0 Sculptor Unkei (1148 \u2013 1223 AD) was well known for using this technique.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A schematic drawing was prepared.<\/li>\n<li>The center log was cut into a rectangular shape.<\/li>\n<li>The head and body were roughly carved from a center block, and other blocks were joined to it by means of clamps and\/or a peg system.<\/li>\n<li>There were five basic ways to combine blocks of wood<\/li>\n<li>Each block was split in sections.<\/li>\n<li>To reduce splitting due to the contraction\/dilation of wood the sections were hollowed out to a thickness of two or three centimeters.<\/li>\n<li>The pieces are rejoined permanently, and final carving completed.<\/li>\n<li>Final modeling and finishing are followed by a coat of lacquer or covered by a lacquered cloth, and coloring and gilding are added.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Fewer knots and a thinner cross-section were preferred by artists, because these pieces tended to crack less. Wood needed to be dried in a controlled environment to avoid the exterior drying out, while the center was still moist. Shrinkage rates could also increase cracks.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller trees could be used with this method, which was beneficial because at the time there was a lack of large ones. This also ensured speedier production. These smaller pieces were also more portable and could be carried back and forth to the off-site shop easily. Additionally, this prefabrication methods allowed for easier repairs of the statues.<\/p>\n<p>The result was sculptures that were less expensive.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What is a Pagoda(to)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Pagoda(to) is a tiered tower with projecting roofs.

It starts with a nicely decorated single ox carriage. Following the carriage, the viewer gets entangled among colliding carts and warriors.<\/p>\n<p>The violence escalates. It culminates as the palace is engulfed by flames. Courtiers have their necks cut. Court ladies in heavy silk dresses are ambushed by arrows and chose to commit suicide by jumping in the wells.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2199\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?resize=872%2C541&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"872\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/203-Night-Attack-Close-Up.jpg?resize=768%2C476&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After kidnapping the retired emperor, the samurai flew on their horses leaving behind a disaster.\u00a0 In the end a running archer followed by a samurai led the rebels far away from the palace engulfed by flames.

The painting was commissioned in the Kamakura period (1185 -1333) and initiated by the Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo. During the Kamakura period the samurai were an established \u201cknightly\u201d class and Minamoto were the shogun\u2019s clan.<\/p>\n<p>The work also has documentary value on the Heiji Rebellion (1159-60). This detail-oriented painting provides precious information on the armor, head protection and weapons of the samurai, as well as the weaponry of other foot soldiers. Observe the historical references of the clothes of courtiers and court ladies. Also look at the architecture and decoration of royal gateways and buildings.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>hand scroll technique probably originated in India around 4th century BCE<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Around the 6th century CE., it arrived via the Silk Road<\/strong> all the way to Japan together with the Buddhist religious scrolls and the Chinese writing system. It took almost two centuries for Japanese Buddhists to produce their own scrolls.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Night Attack on the Sanj\u00f4 Palace<\/em><\/strong> is a narrative painting, called <strong>e-maki<\/strong>. It combines an illustrated hand scroll, with the sequential technique of the Buddhist scrolls, and the traditional Japanese painting, yamato-e, developed alongside poetry during the Heian period.<\/p>\n<p>Initially e-maki depicted literary classics such as <em>The Tale of Genji<\/em>. In the military ruled Kamakura era, illustrated handscrolls often had a focus on \u201cwar tales\u201d like this one. The action-oriented paintings or the ones detailing historical events were preferred by men. They were called otoko\u2010e, or \u201cmen\u2019s paintings\u201d. An entire set was dedicated to the events of the Heiji rebellion. Another scroll tells the story of Taira recuperating the retired Emperor and one is only remnants.<\/p>\n<p>The attack on the retired emperor was insignificant, but the painting is a masterpiece of Japanese painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Patron<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The audience of an emaki was reduced. It is an intimate object that was held in the hands of the narrator who presented the story scene by scene to a small group of listeners.<\/p>\n<p>With their exquisite calligraphy and paintings, generally done by official court painters, the emaki appealed to an educated elite, such as the imperial family, the shogun, or Buddhist monks.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The scene takes place during the Heiji Rebellion at the end of the Heian period. This was known as the period of calm and tranquility. This is considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court. At the end of this era the sovereignty laid with the emperor, but in fact the power was wielded by the noble clans.<\/p>\n<p>The Fujiwara and afterwards the Taira clan controlled the imperial court by marrying their daughters with the emperor and relegating the emperors to endless ceremonial functions. Japanese emperors reclaimed their power by abdicating in favor of a successor and relegating that one to conduct the ceremonies. Disputes ensued each time that the successor to the throne was chosen or an emperor retired.<\/p>\n<p>By participating in all these disputes, the samurai warrior class steadily rose and made political gains throughout the entire Heian period.<\/p>\n<p>In 1159, during the Heiji Rebellion the courtier Fujiwara no Nobuyori seemed the help of the samurai Minamoto no Yoshitomo to attack the palace. They started a fire and mercilessly killed courtiers and court ladies, in a bid to seize both the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa and his son from the power grip of the rival samurai clan, Taira.<\/p>\n<p>Minamoto tried to control the emperor. Another scroll continues the story by telling how the Taira managed to regain control of the emperor. The continued rivalry between Minamoto and Taira led to the civil Genpei War, the destruction of the Taira and the establishment of the Minamoto Shogunate.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Connections with other works: Bayeux tapestry<\/strong><\/h5>\n<h5><strong>(2) 59.

Shakyo involves chanting, which is guided by a monk.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Gardens of Japan<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Originally from Kamukura, <strong>Muso Soseki<\/strong> made some of the most important gardens in his time in and around Kyoto. Between the 12th and 14th century, Kamakura was the capital of Japan. It was governed by the Samurai. Many gardens were built around a huge Zen temple called Kamakura Gozan or Five Mountains. This beautiful setting was known for its bay and expansive mountains. This region also made good use of vast farmlands.<\/p>\n<p>Kyoto too had a long history of gardens for its aristocratic and dynastic cultures. The lifestyle here was different. Boating was popular.\u00a0 Pond gardens and blossoming cherry trees provided a beautiful background.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Karesansui<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Karesansui is a Japanese garden style which represents the abstracted natural landscape mainly by rock compositions. Early karesansui in the 13th century was built on a hillside. Many gardens in Kamakura gardens have this style. Later karensansui in the 15th and 16th century was built on flatlands using mountains as a backdrop. Many Kyoto gardens have this style.<\/p>\n<p>Ryoan-ji garden once used borrowed scenery from the far away Mt. Otokoyama. Then, it added a low fence to create more dimension. Minimum elements, deck, stone edges, sand, and rock add to this.<\/p>\n<p>Later design techniques became more sophisticated pertaining to rock composition, layout of steppingstones, and even the materials used.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What are some of the main characteristics of a Kamakura garden? <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Kamakura is boarded by mountains on all three sides, so this was incorporated into the gardens. This technique is called borrowed scenery or incorporating background landscapes into garden compositions. No fences were used so that the gardens blended in seamlessly.<\/p>\n<p>Texture and color of the background played a part in composition. Gardens had to work with the natural topography and most run through valleys.<\/p>\n<p>Early Zen temples in Kamakura incorporated ponds into gardens. These would later fuse into tea style gardens.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What are some of the main characteristics of a Kyoto garden?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Kyoto is a flatland surrounded by mountains. This provided flat gardens in an urban setting. The borrowed scenery was from the very distant mountains. Water from these mountains helped to form natural ponds.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Differences<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Kamukura and Kyoto styles differ due to topography and climate.<\/p>\n<p>The dynamic relation with a natural landscape is one of the characteristics of Kamakura gardens. It makes a significant difference between Kamakura gardens and later karesanui gardens in Kyoto.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Similarities<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>There are interesting similarities between Kamakura gardens and Kyoto gardens in the later period like Japanese tea gardens and the Shugaku-in garden.<\/p>\n<p>Zen monks brought the tradition of cultivating tea from China to Japan during the very early Kamakura period (1185-1333). Monks first used a tearoom, before a whole tea house was constructed. Gardens were part of the overall ambience.<\/p>\n<p>Sh\u016bgaku-in is comprised of three gardens connected by gravel paths. These wind through vegetables paths and fields of rice.\u00a0 There is the upper garden, middle garden, and upper garden. Emperor Gomizuno-o (1596-1680) built these gardens as a retreat just outside of Kyoto.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(8) 210. <em>White and Red Plum Blossoms.<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Ogata Korin.

Being a famous Japanese work, it is also known as <strong><em>The<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0<strong><em>Great Wave<\/em>.<\/strong> Influenced by Dutch art, Katsushika Hokusai made this print as a part of the larger series titled\u00a0<em>Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Not only was it reproduced innumerable times, but also it became a part of several modern artists&#8217; assemblage practice, either through distorting or recreating an extended picture.<\/p>\n<p>To represent a common wave, the image is also a part of the WhatsApp emoji list.<\/p>\n<p>Although it is a realistic depiction, it employs optical illusion to illustrate the representation of Mount Fuji. It is essential to notice the same while being stunned by the magnanimity of the superseding wave on the left.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Under The Wave off Kanagawa<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0is a Japanese seascape <strong>Ukiyo-e print<\/strong>. Comprising several waves, large and tiny, it depicts Mount Fuji, which apparently alludes to the shape of the wave. Evoking a sense of fear and excitement, the interplay of the larger wave at the left, looming over the boatmen in three boats, is exceptional. The boatmen grip the planks tightly to save them from drowning against the encroaching big wave. At the same time, the dramatic variation in the angle of the boats on the waves develops a realistic representation.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>color palette<\/strong> is subtle and complacent. On the top left, the inscription mentions the name of the artist along with the studio. As it is a print, it was reproduced innumerable times, which eventually paved the way for popularity throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Great Wave<\/em>\u00a0is a part of the series<\/strong>, which depicted Mount Fuji from various perspectives and compositions. Mount Fuji, at a distance, germinates the sense of perspective that Japanese artists were privy to. With emotive turbulence and an interesting visual play<strong><em>, The Great Wave<\/em><\/strong> stands at a junction of being one of the normative works of art. The cresting wave also highlights the idea of transitory time, as it is about to recede in the vast ocean. Moreover, visually, it appears like it will engulf everything that comes in its way, men, beings, and the highest mountain of Japan, Mount Fuji.<\/p>\n<p>The apparent <strong>symbolism points out the Zen approach through the teachings of Buddhism<\/strong>. The boatmen show a sense of preparedness in the face of chaos and impending destruction. In addition, the <strong>Ukiyo-e print<\/strong> represents the contrasting nature of several aspects like a deal between man and nature, natural elements of sky and water, among other attributes. Overall, it is a material idea of <strong>a Zen philosophical term called yin and yang<\/strong>, the two opposites.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mount Fuji serves dichotomous reason in the making of several prints by <strong>Hokusai<\/strong>. Not only is it a sacred mountain in Japanese culture, but also with increased tourism, the market demanded the images of the peak. Purchased as souvenirs, they were bought by townspeople who visited the city to climb the mountain as a pilgrimage. Fortunately, <strong><em>The Great Wave<\/em><\/strong> was reproduced more than 3000 times during that time. Hence, the primary purpose of the print was commerce, in which the aesthetic sensibility subverted the existing identity of the <strong>ukiyo-e technique.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ukioy-e print techniques<\/strong> require common and inexpensive materials. It comprises surfaces of the block of wood, inks, and paper.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Dispaly of Emotion<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Hokusai<\/strong> has explicitly represented the abstract emotions of fear, excitement against natural forces. Such moments are transitory and tend to stop in time like the large cresting wave over the boats. However, while the large wave symbolizes power, the boats and the men tell us about courage in the face of timid times. The emotional response of the men is quite evident by their pose of laying on the boat planks. They are ready to be drowned or saved by the big wave crashing overhead.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Tradition<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0is an Ukiyo-e woodblock print, which was popular during the Edo period of Japan. Generally, they depicted everyday scenes in an utter simplistic rendering. They also showed middle-class women during their routine life.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the Ukiyo-e prints of courtesan quarters are an impeccable collection of erotica. The term <strong>Ukiyo-e means the floating world<\/strong>, which metaphorically states the idea of impermanence and transitory aspects. <strong>Ukiyo-e prints<\/strong> were recognized by their <strong>emphasis on line and usage of bright hues.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Ukiyo-e, the woodblock is carved using an engraver. For each color to be printed, a new block is utilized. After the blocks are ready, they are spread with inks and placed under the printing setup. The paper is placed, and the prints are rolled under the pressure. Each block with a specific color must be aligned to have a composed and accurate depiction. Technically, they were used only to create images of courtesans. However, Hokusai altered this course by using the technique for landscape prints.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2209\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyoe-1.jpg?resize=216%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"216\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyoe-1.jpg?resize=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1 216w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyoe-1.jpg?w=272&amp;ssl=1 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2210\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-2.jpg?resize=220%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-2.jpg?resize=220%2C300&amp;ssl=1 220w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-2.jpg?w=222&amp;ssl=1 222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2211\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-3.jpg?resize=223%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"223\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-3.jpg?resize=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1 223w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-3.jpg?w=224&amp;ssl=1 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2212\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-4.jpg?resize=198%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-4.jpg?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Ukiyo-e-4.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Ukiyo-e woodblock print technique, the painting discloses the <strong>influence of the Dutch on Japanese and Chinese art<\/strong>. Dutch were the first to render landscapes and seascapes in their artworks. At the same time, the Dutch artworks are known for their precise lines, low horizon, and utility of Prussian blue. All these elements were transferred in the Hokusai practice, which is evidently seen in <strong><em>The<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0<strong><em>Great Wave<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Artist and the Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong><em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0was created as one of the thirty-six prints <strong>by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.<\/strong> Born in 1760 in Edo, which is now known as Tokyo, Hokusai discovered western prints, which came to Japan through Dutch citizens.<\/p>\n<p>These prints, which emphasize perspective, influenced Hokusai\u2019s prints. He also used shades of blue, which were prevalent in western prints. Moreover, Hokusai was also interested in experimenting with the visual play of contrasting aspects and elements. As seen in <strong><em>The\u00a0Great Wave<\/em><\/strong>, the magnanimity of the large wave is balanced by the distant, in perspective, the image of Mount Fuji.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Setting<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>After the Meiji restoration, Japan opened trade and cultural exchange with the world, which first only happened at Nagasaki. The onset of communication with the western countries exposed a variety of Japanese art and culture to European artists.<\/p>\n<p>The woodblock prints were in vogue in countries like France, among others. Many other Japanese products caught the attention of the local market as well as European artists like Claude Monet and Van Gogh, which defined the term Japonisme.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1640, Japan was totally shut from the world, while sparsely interacting with China and Holland. However, with the Meiji restoration in the 1850s, the trade was forcefully opened by an American naval commodore, Matthew C. Perry. Remarkably, Hokusai works were also exhibited at the International Exposition of Paris in 1867, marking the first exposure of Japanese art to the world.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>More About Japanese Paintings<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Yamato-e<\/strong> painting flourished in Japan during the <strong>Heian period (794\u20131185<\/strong>).

This was known as \u201cthe period of calm and tranquility,\u201d or the Heian period. The court was at the center creating innovative new trends in painting and literature.<\/p>\n<p>The term <strong>yamato-e<\/strong> literally means <strong>\u201cJapanese painting\u201d.<\/strong> This was a term used to distinguish Japanese painting from Chinese painting.<\/p>\n<p>Japanese paintings included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>tales from Japanese literature and history<\/li>\n<li>activities and motifs associated with the four seasons<\/li>\n<li>Japanese locales<\/li>\n<li>Rich, rolling hills<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>The Heian Period and Onward<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Later, <strong>yamato-e<\/strong> evolved to be not only about locale and content but also contained:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highly stylized figures<\/li>\n<li>Abbreviated facial features.<\/li>\n<li>Paints and thick pigment<\/li>\n<li>Clouds to hide and divide spaces<\/li>\n<li>Blown off roof tops to glimpse inside buildings (known as <strong>fukiniki yatai<\/strong>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Literature<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>One of the most famous Japanese novels ever written is entitled <strong><em>Tale of Genji. <\/em><\/strong>It was written by Murasaki Shikibu, who was a court lady, back in the year 1000.

This allows the viewer to peak in at a private scene.<\/p>\n<p>These <strong>paintings<\/strong> during the <strong>Heian period (794-1185)<\/strong> appeared on <strong>screens and sliding doors<\/strong>. Such doors had a functional purpose. They divided rooms and kept spaces warm. Therefore, very few survive. It is interesting to note that these doors changed with the season with complementary images for winter, spring, summer and fall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Waka poetry<\/strong> developed alongside <strong>yamato-e<\/strong>. These poems are <strong>comprised of 31 syllables<\/strong>, either created with the paintings or inspired by them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yamato-e paintings <\/strong>were also<strong> painted onto handscrolls <\/strong>and were <strong>called emaki. <\/strong>These works depict classic literature.
