Each <strong>16-foot-tall gate<\/strong> had a piece of <strong>saffron colored fabric<\/strong> hanging to 7 feet above ground level. The widths of the gates matched the widths of the walkways. Gates were set down to avoid drilling. \u00a0The structures formed an oval path that intersected.

The artists wanted to alter the experience of walking in the park to be an original, temporary experience. A golden ceiling creating warm shadows for visitors, as well as a refuge from city life.

Light moved through it mirroring the visitors\u2019 movement underneath it.<\/p>\n<p>The installation was inspired by Japanese Shinto tradition of torii (gates) that mark the transition at shrines from the secular to the sacred.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The husband-and-wife artist team of \u00a0<strong>Christo and Jeanne-Claude <\/strong>developed the concept for the art installation in 1979. It was not produced until 2005. For this reason, we can consider it as linked to environmental\/site-specific art of the 1970s.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Gates<\/em><\/strong> cost $21 million. The artist financed the project themselves. There were no sponsors, instead they self-fund every project and sold merchandise related to the exhibition. Part of the costs of the work were wages for 600 workers to install it. The team also paid for security guards at night.<\/p>\n<p>The artists had to submit proposals, attend meetings, and make presentations to \u00a0both the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy administration. In 1982, they received a 251-page rejection.<\/p>\n<p>The election of Michael Bloomberg, in 2001, who was a fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, was the turning point.<\/p>\n<p>Central Park was constructed in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century and was meant as a city refuge. It recalled ideas of the Victorian pastoral and picturesque.<\/p>\n<p>People criticized <strong><em>The Gates<\/em><\/strong> for interfering with man\u2019s relationship with nature. But the irony is that Central Park itself was constructed in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century as a city refuge.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong><em>(10) 239.

It was shot using high-speed film that achieved 300 frames per second in great detail. Viola reduced the speed of the playback to extremely slow motion. This enhances the drama. Sound amplifies the experience.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The artist wanted to create an immersive sound and video environment to dwell on transformation and change as well as growth and decay. These are inevitable processes.<\/p>\n<p>Slow-motion is not just a technological choice. It is meant to invite a meditative and contemplative response. One that requires the viewer to concentrate for longer and slows us down. This increases our awareness of movement, detail, and change. This creates a connection between the artistic and spiritual experience. We could interpret it in a religious way, even though the work makes no direct iconographic or religious overtones.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2583\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Crossing-Fire.jpg?resize=990%2C685&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"685\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Crossing-Fire.jpg?resize=1024%2C709&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Crossing-Fire.jpg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Crossing-Fire.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Crossing-Fire.jpg?w=1156&amp;ssl=1 1156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are two different video sequences that are simultaneously shown.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Water + fire = duality<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the <strong>water video <\/strong>the male figure walks slowly towards the camera.
