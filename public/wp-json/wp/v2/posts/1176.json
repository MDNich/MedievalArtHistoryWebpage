The community was based on farming, livestock, mining, and trade. The ruling elite appear to have controlled wealth through the management of cattle which was the cornerstone of the Zimbabwean economy. By 1500, their influence waned though historians are not sure why.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Archaeological evidence<\/strong> has revealed glass beads and porcelain from China and Persia, as well as gold and Arab coins. This illustrates the extent of the long-distance trade that Zimbabwe participated in with the outside world.<\/p>\n<p>In \u00a0the 1800s, English colonizers found Great Zimbabwe and were stunned by the grandeur and workmanship. It was concluded that Muslims must have constructed this (even though there is no evidence of Muslims in this area).
