There is a focus on the <strong>five-direction<\/strong>&#8211;north, south, east, west, and center. <strong>Cosmic geometry<\/strong> and <strong>spirituality<\/strong> based in visionary shamanism are other factors. High value is placed on <strong>animal-based<\/strong> media such as featherwork, bone carving, and hide painting.<\/p>\n<p>Art relies on the incorporation of trade material <strong>greenstones<\/strong>, such as turquoise and jadeite. It also uses <strong>shells<\/strong>, such as the spiny oyster. In the case of Native North America, <strong>imported beads<\/strong>, <strong>machine-made cloth<\/strong>, and <strong>glazes<\/strong> are used. \u00a0Stylistic focus is on the essence rather than the appearance of subjects. Creation of aesthetic objects that have a strong functional aspect, reference, or utility include vessels, grinding platforms, and pipes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>In Andean Culture <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The necessity to interact with three disparate environments&#8211;mountains, desert coast, and rainforest&#8211; in order to survive instilled in <strong>Andean culture<\/strong> and art an underlying emphasis on trade in exotic materials. A hierarchy of materials was based on availability and\/ or requirement for collaboration to manipulate the materials.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Featherwork, textiles, and greenstone<\/strong> were most popular. Textiles were a primary medium and were extraordinarily well preserved on the desert coast, fulfilling key practical and artistic functions in the various environmental\u00a0zones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Metalwork, bone, obsidian, and stone<\/strong> were sometimes employed. \u00a0<strong>Ceramics<\/strong> and <strong>wood<\/strong> were also sometimes used.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Mesoamerican Architecture<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Mesoamerican pyramids began as early earthworks, changed to nine-level structures with single temples, and then later became structures with twin temples. Sacred sites were renovated and enlarged repeatedly over the centuries, resulting in acropolises and massive temples.<\/p>\n<p>Architecture was mainly <strong>stone post-and-lintel<\/strong>, often faced with <strong>relief sculpture and painted bright colors<\/strong>, emphasizing large masses that sculpt outdoor space. Plazas were typical for large ritual gatherings. Elaborate burials and other underground installations to honor the role of the underworld were also found.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Native American Art<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Native American art media includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthworks<\/li>\n<li>Stone and adobe architecture<\/li>\n<li>Wood and bone carving<\/li>\n<li>Weaving and basketry<\/li>\n<li>Hide painting<\/li>\n<li>Ceramics<\/li>\n<li>Quillwork<\/li>\n<li>Beadwork<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>More recently artworks have included <strong>painting on canvas<\/strong> and other European-style media.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Geometric patterning<\/strong>, and <strong>figures<\/strong> that are mythic or shamanic often appear. <strong>Animals <\/strong>that are popular in Native American art include: <strong>snakes, birds, bison, and horses<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(5) 158.

This reflected the four corners of the empire. It takes on the shape of a puma\/ jaguar, which is the royal animal of the Inca.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>masonry <\/strong>is special and unique to the region. Each individual stone is fitted uniquely to the one placed next to it. This results in blocks that have a varied number of sides. The goal is to keep each stone as true to its original shape as possible, but just flattened on the sides presented. This means the \u00a0blocks were not going to be like bricks.\u00a0 Stones that are fitted this way allow for a small amount of movement. This is especially important in an earthquake-prone region.

This also helped to <strong>reframe Native pottery as fine art<\/strong>, instead of promoting it as utilitarian. To aide this, she began to <strong>sign her name<\/strong> on the bottom of the pots. This made her name the brand, but it also denied the communal nature of the pot. However, she began to make more money per pot.<\/p>\n<p>The buyers were those that had interest in <strong>Native art<\/strong>, mainly white Americans. Soon, she began to sell the pots to major art galleries.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>San Ildefonso<\/strong> <strong>style<\/strong>: based on 12<sup>th<\/sup>-17<sup>th<\/sup> century Puebloan ceramic shards (based on Neolithic designs) that had recently been discovered in excavations<\/li>\n<li>Two design registers: one across the shoulder\/body and one across the neck<\/li>\n<li>Elements are abstract, but are probably depicting natural motifs<\/li>\n<li>Shape, color, and design match the contemporary and geometric Art Deco movement, popular between the two WWs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Before the arrival of the railroad to this area in the 1880s, pots were used for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. When inexpensive pots appeared along the railroad, Native practices declined. The introduction of tin and metal meant cheaper, easier to make, sturdier pots.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>About the Artists\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Maria Martinez<\/strong> is one of the best-known Native potters in part due to her connections with a larger, non-Native audience. She lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso from 1887 to 1980. This is located 20 miles north of Santa Fe.<\/p>\n<p>She spoke Tewa, the language of the Pueblo culture. Martinez learned the ceramic techniques by watching potters from San Ildefonso. Also, she and her husband Julian were present at the excavations in their community. They drew designs that they found on pottery shards.<\/p>\n<p>Making pottery had traditionally been a communal activity, where different steps in the process were shared. <strong>Maria<\/strong> formed the vessels by hand. Julian would decorate and paint the pots.<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, because making pots were communal, they were never signed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>NEXT UP:<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Indigenous Americas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> 1000 BCE- 1980 CE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/indigenous-americas-5-3\/\">TOPIC 5.3 Purpose and Audience in Indigenous American Art<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Indigenous Americas 1000 BCE- 1980 CE TOPIC 5.2 Materials, Processes, and Techniques in Indigenous American Art \u00a0Artistic traditions of the &hellip; <span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/indigenous-americas-5-2\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue Reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Indigenous Americas 5.2<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":""},"categories":[25,15],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1081"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1081"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1081\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2771,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1081\/revisions\/2771"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1081"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1081"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1081"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
