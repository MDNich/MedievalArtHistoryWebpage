Artist rarely specialized in it. This was not so for female artists. This was as high as they were expected to go. Male counterparts believed they did not have the mental capacity for anything higher!<\/p>\n<p>Painting was considered a hobby for women and not a profession. When women did learn how to paint they were often taught by their husbands or fathers. When they did succeed commercially, they were referred to as \u201clady painters.\u201d<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Career and Family\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Ruysch was enormously successful in a 60-year career, producing over 250 paintings. For eight of those years, she was a court painter to the Bavarian court for eight years.<\/p>\n<p>She also raised 10 children!<\/p>\n<p>Ruysch grew up in Amsterdam, in a family of Dutch artists and scientist. Her father was a prominent scientist and specialized in botany. He possessed a collection of rare specimens, which she helped him catalogue and record.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Dutch Golden Age, in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century<\/strong>, fueled an interest in exotic plants and flowers including \u201cTulip Mania\u201d.

These were spaces for men to be with their mistresses. Upon arrival, the gentleman asked Doyen if he would paint his mistress on a swing that a bishop would push. The gentleman would be placed in such a way that he would be able to see up the skirt of his mistress.<\/p>\n<p>Doyen declined by saying \u201cwell\u2026thank you for thinking of me but I don\u2019t really paint things like this. However, I know someone who does, and his name is <strong>Fragonard<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This painting was the result!<\/p>\n<p>It has been speculated that the patron may have been Baron de Saint-Julien.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Fun and Frivolity<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This work celebrates the leisure of the upper class. It was painted to be erotically tantalizing. It was meant to represent a game. Gardens are for play. The couple is playing a game. We are playing the game by interpreting the painting.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Upon Closer Inspection<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>There is a lot going on in this work, which makes it an <strong>intrigue painting. <\/strong>A scene of scandal, playfulness, and flirtation, suggests a secret love affair. The patron\/lover in lower left is looking up the skirt at the young lady who swings while a Bishop pushes her. This could be a possible comment on the corruption of the church.<\/p>\n<p>The garden is fertile, abundant, growing out of control.\u00a0 This is based on an <strong>English garden<\/strong>, with controlled and constructed outdoor spaces but have the appearance of being wild and natural, despite still being planned and arranged. Here the figures seem to be in a private park, hidden away.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Iconographic interpretation<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Swinging<\/strong> is an association with fickleness and female inconstancy. It is in reference to the act of lovemaking, but swinging is also a reference to a cheating lover.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>barking dog<\/strong> might be alluding us to the fact that the scene should be quiet and calm.\u00a0 The dog does not symbolize fidelity here, rather impatience, carnal desire, animalistic urges, and arousal.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>pink roses<\/strong> are a symbol of female genitalia, as is the <strong>pink dress<\/strong> and shape of the opening.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shoe coming off<\/strong> is a common indication of lost virginity and one who has succumbed to passion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Man\u2019s hat off <\/strong>at the end of a long slim arm<strong>,<\/strong> is a symbol of an erection.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>man is embedded in rose bush<\/strong> is a symbol of sex.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rake on the ground<\/strong> is similar to a crass term for male genitalia in French.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>shushing cupid<\/strong> is based on a statue that was in Madame de Pompadour\u2019s home (a famous woman known for love) and heightens the illicit nature of the scene.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dolphins <\/strong>are a reference to Venus because she was pulled to the shore by dolphins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Putti <\/strong>is Cupid\u2019s friends sitting on top of the dolphin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The garden<\/strong> is fertile, abundant, and wild with unbridled passion.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Leisure of the French Aristocracy<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Indulgences<\/strong> that characterized the French aristocracy before the Revolution included the pursuit of pleasure, and playfulness. Games were very popular. This calls attention to the amount of leisure time they had. Games were also symbols of the poor. It was trendy to \u201cplay\u201d poor and simple, like farm girls and peasant boys.<\/p>\n<p>The strict rules of conduct were loosened in these societal situations. Additionally, by participating in these activities, aristocrats believed they received health benefits or relaxation, while stimulating both their senses and intellect. This combated boredom!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Public parks<\/strong> and <strong>private gardens<\/strong> were increasingly popular. These were places where flirtatious physical interactions were allowed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Aristocrats, Status and Art <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artistic renderings of aristocrats playing and being frivolous were very popular.

He was known for depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods. The artist belonged to a scientific group called the Lunar Society of Birmingham.

This is an example of an early <strong>casta painting<\/strong>, depicting inter ethnic mixing of the Europeans and indigenous people of New Spain. It belongs to a larger series of works.<\/p>\n<p>These are not portraits, but characters from the artist\u2019s imagination. The artwork helps to illustrate life in the New World. In the artist earlier works, from which this is an example, he depicts the figures as wealthy and distinguished.<\/p>\n<p>The space in the painting is not defined. This allows the viewer to focus on the figures entirely. These are painted naturally and realistically.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Marketplace for Casta Paintings\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>These works were commissioned by elite Europeans. Many series were commissioned by viceroys. These were to be given to Spanish rulers to illustrate the racial and ethnic mixings in the New World.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Racism in Art<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>A series of casta paintings usually contained 16 paintings or even 16 vignettes within one painting. The first in a series showed a European man with an elite indigenous woman and their child or <strong>mestizo<\/strong>, or racial mix.<\/p>\n<p>As the family trees progressed in additional paintings and races continued to mix, the figures appeared less prominent and wealthy, and they appeared to have a darker skin tone.<\/p>\n<p>Clothing, accoutrements, activities all aid in racially labeling the people in the work. All are numbered with text inscriptions, on the front or back, that label the races in the work.<\/p>\n<p>All the above indicated society\u2019s notion that social status, wealth, and overall worth were directly tied to race.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>A Plus B Equals C<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This image is the first in the series, depicting a husband, wife, and child. This is modeled after depictions of the Holy Family showing the Virgin, St. Joseph, and Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The European father wears French-style European clothing complete with a powdered wig. The indigenous mother is dressed in a <strong>huipl<\/strong>, a traditional woman\u2019s garment worn by indigenous women from central Mexico. It has lace sleeves. Her sumptuous jewelry indicates to the viewer that she is an aristocratic native. The two types of dress styles help to carry the subject matter of blended families forward.<\/p>\n<p>The child is a racial mix of both parents. The family appears calm, harmonious, and loving. A young servant holds the child while looking up to the baby\u2019s father.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Historical Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Sociedad de Castas<\/strong> was the racial hierarchy developed in the New World to alleviate social anxieties over mixed-race people. European whites, New World whites, mestizos, indigenous peoples, mulattos, zambos, and African, were some of the descriptions used.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Casta paintings<\/strong> spoke to Enlightenment concerns, or specifically, the notion that people can be categorized racially based on ethnic makeup and appearance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>The Taste for the Natural<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>The taste for the natural<\/strong> was promoted by the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. There was an<\/p>\n<p>interest in the \u2018natural\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018artificial\u2019. This was a rejection of Baroque artificiality,<\/p>\n<p>and emphasized relaxed, elegant poses and \u00a0tall figures with low horizon lines.<\/p>\n<p>The taste for natural promoted the \u201ccult of sensibility\u201d and \u201ccult of domesticity\u201d. Values included sentimentality, emotion, naturalism, and virtue.<\/p>\n<p>Grand Manner portraits dominated, especially in England.

But, she is not a threat because of her great femininity. She is pretty, demure, soft, gentle, and sophisticated.<\/p>\n<p>Female artists had to traverse a very fine line of showing their talent to be equal to a man, but consoling men and calming them by reminding them that their genders were quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Critics called the artist vain and self-important.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun<\/strong> was 35 when this was painted. She is looking at the viewer as she paints a portrait of Marie Antoinette. She was Queen Marie Antoinette\u2019s official court painter and personal friend.<\/p>\n<p>In the painting she sits in a relaxed pose at her easel. She looks very pretty. Her skin looks soft, with rosy cheeks, gentle curls, piercing eyes, and flowing silk. She wears a white turban and dark dress with a soft white ruffled collar \u2013 in the free-flowing Grecian style. This was inspired by the style that Marie-Antoinette had made popular at the French court. Certainly, not an outfit a painter would paint in. Yet, the brushes are ready along with a palette.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Context<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>In 1783, <strong>Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun<\/strong>, who specialized in portraiture, was admitted to the French Royal Academy, as the first female member. \u00a0Her entrance however was orchestrated by her most important patron&#8211; Marie Antoinette! Now, she certainly deserved to be there, but to many men, it looked like one corrupt woman pulling strings for another woman.<\/p>\n<p>Marie Antoinette was deeply disliked at this point in France. Many artists and writers argued that it was Rococo, and by extension women in general, who were leading France down the road to decay.<\/p>\n<p>Marie Antoinette, the Rococo excesses, indeed femininity in general, was criticized for having made France and men effeminate. This was blamed for all of France\u2019s problems (debt, corruption, a weak Louis XVI, and a deeply disliked Marie Antoinette). Many believed the only way to end this was revolution.<\/p>\n<p>When the French Revolution occurred, <strong>Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun<\/strong>, had to flee and escape. This work was created soon after her departure from France.<\/p>\n<p>The artist ended up traveling to Italy and Russia to paint nobility and royalty.

There is a naturalistic treatment of the body, and it is well-proportioned.\u00a0\u00a0 Note the use of variety in the background with color and implied texture.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, we see the \u201cNatural\u201d style with some Grand Manner techniques mixed in. The work is casual, relaxed, and elegant, with a low horizon line, pushed forward, and a larger figure.<\/p>\n<p>We can see the quality of artists have improved over works such <em>Angel with Arquebus<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Function<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This portrait insists on her status as an intellectual as well as a nun. It ennobles her as an intelligent and pious woman. The work also commemorates Sor Juana 55 years after her death, for admirers, who were likely supporters of Jeronymite order. She was obviously quite a famous Jeronymite nun.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is a famous depiction of the esteemed Mexican nun and writer. Cabrera modeled this painting on images of male scholars seated at their desks.<\/p>\n<p>She wears the <strong>habit<\/strong> of her religious order and an <strong>escudo de monja<\/strong> (nun\u2019s badge) on her chest (similar to Sin Sukju). This displayed the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation.<\/p>\n<p>Her <strong>left-hand<\/strong> toys with her rosary, while she turns a page of an open book with <strong>her right hand<\/strong>. The book is a text by St. Jerome. This is a contrast between her religious life (rosary) and her intellectual life (books).<\/p>\n<p>She looks towards us, her gaze direct and assertive, as she sits at a desk in her library.

He has squandered \u00a0his aristocratic fortunes. Pointing to his family tree, with a medieval knight suggesting a great lineage, he sits with a gout-ridden foot made worse with inactivity. There are Old Master\u2019s paintings on the walls and construction going on outdoors in the new Palladian style.<\/p>\n<p>Here, also sits <strong>a wealthy merchant<\/strong> without a title. <strong>Lord Squanderfield\u2019s son<\/strong> and the <strong>merchant\u2019s daughter<\/strong> are going to marry.<\/p>\n<p>Young Squanderfield is picking snuff out of a box, while looking in the mirror at his own reflection. He has his back turned toward his soon to be bride, with disinterest. Black velvet patches cover syphilis marks.<\/p>\n<p>The daughter sits frumpily and slumped over to show a lack of intelligence, while being wooed by <strong>Silvertongue, her father\u2019s lawyer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Image 2 (The Tete a Tete) <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Tete to Tete means \u201chead-to-head\u201d or \u201cface to face\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the marriage, each partner has been pursuing pleasures without the other. The <strong>husband<\/strong> has been out all night with another woman and gambling. The dog sniffs at a bonnet in his jacket, as if assessing what the husband has been up to. The man looks tired and upset. There is a broken sword underneath him indicating a loss.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>wife<\/strong> has been playing cards all night. Her bodice is undone. She is yawning. Slyly she is looking out of the corner of her eye to see if he notices. Her lover has just left in a hurry! Notice the turned over chair. The violin player has made a hasty retreat. Violins were symbols of sexual pleasure, in old medieval reference, alluding to what has just taken place.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>accountant<\/strong> wears a frustrated expression. He throws his hands up in the air. She has lost a fortune at cards. He just cannot get this couple to take their finances seriously.<\/p>\n<p>The chandelier\u2019s candles have just gone out. They have been burning all evening.\u00a0 A sculpture with a broken nose has been knocked over on the fireplace mantle. This indicates that although the couple have nice things, they do not bother to take care of them.<\/p>\n<p>There is a nude painting on the back wall, next to three paintings of saints. The nude is covered with a cloth, but it is still visible. It has been covered in a haphazardly way, just like her affair!<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>servant <\/strong>is yawning in the back room, while rearranging the chairs.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Image 3 (The Inspection)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Young Squanderfield<\/strong>, suffering from syphilis, makes a visit to a <strong>doctor<\/strong>.

Beside him is a book called <em>The Sofa<\/em>, which was a common erotic novel of the day. There is a coral rope used for teething on the chair where the Countess sits. The baby is not in the artwork to illustrate her poor maternal skills.<\/p>\n<p>The Old Masters\u2019 paintings hanging depict Lot and His Daughters (incest), Jupiter and Io (seduction), and Rape of Ganymede (homosexual seduction).<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Image 5 (The Bagnio)<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Squanderfield<\/strong> catches his <strong>wife<\/strong> with her lover, <strong>Silvertongue<\/strong>, in a bagnio, or inn, where rooms could be taken without questions asked.

This was the year Washington gave his farewell address.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Content<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This shows George Washington as a public servant.

(Congress approved this in 1782)<\/p>\n<p>Does not hold <strong>his officer\u2019s sword<\/strong>, it hangs on the outside of the fasces, just outside his reach. This signifies he can be strong but should not immediately resort to this.<\/p>\n<p>He is a private citizen. The plow rests behind Washington and reminds us that he is a simple man tied to the earth. This refers to the story of Roman dictator Cincinnatus, who resigned when his leadership, so he could return to his farm (rather than Caesar who created absolute power for himself). This parallel shows how Washington turned down the office and stepped away from the Presidency.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>walking stick<\/strong> symbolizes that Washington was well-known as a man who loved to stroll his estate.
