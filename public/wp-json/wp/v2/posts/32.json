The has served as a basis for art history studies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Archaeology<\/strong> supports understandings of how people, culture, and therefore art travelled across the globe, well before highly organized societies were formed. Important monuments, such as the caves at Lascaux, and media, particularly ceramics, were first discovered. Then these artifacts were described by archaeologists. Then, became available for interpretation by art historians.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0A Deeper Understanding<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The function of artistic expression prior to written records is inferred from evidence of technology and survival strategies. It is also based on the relationship of tools and their function, whether task-related or expressive. Other notes to consider include the<strong> available food sources, the rise of sophisticated culture, and humans\u2019 capacity to shape and manage the environment.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Basic art historical methods can be applied to prehistoric art by comparing works of art, imagery, materials, and techniques to identify patterns. Think a prevalence of transformational anima or human iconography as an example.\u00a0 Then ethnographic approaches can be used to propose hypotheses such as certain iconography is shamanic in nature.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cross-cultural comparisons<\/strong> can help establish wider generalizations. For example, South African, Asian, and indigenous American peoples all participated in rock\/cave expressions of a visionary aesthetic In this way, even a small amount of evidence can produce theories. These can be proposed, tested, refined, and potentially rejected by conflicting evidence or new information. This is true as in other periods of art history, as well as other disciplines.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>(1) 2. Great Hall of Bulls<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Prehistoric European. \u00a015,000-13,000 BCE.
