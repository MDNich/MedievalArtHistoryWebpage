This lack of excess embellishment concentrates on remembering rather than representing those who died.<\/p>\n<p>Lin drew on the language of Minimalism to create the memorial, constructing two simple walls of reflective black gabbro stone that meet to make an obtuse angle. Lin cut into the earth to allow visitors to descend along a walkway which, in Minimalist fashion, enables viewers to interact with the work and the terrain. Viewers engage with the names of the deceased, which are inscribed on the wall that rises alongside the walkway.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2456\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial..jpg?resize=695%2C462&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial..jpg?w=695&amp;ssl=1 695w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial..jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Vietnam-Veterans-Memorial..jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Vietnam Veterans Memorial<\/em>.

Washington, D.C., U.S. Maya Lin. 1982 C.E. Granite.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lin\u2019s untraditional design was controversial, in a similar fashion to Rodin\u2019s <strong><em>The Burghers of Calais<\/em><\/strong> in placement and figural representation. This controversy was compounded after it was revealed that Lin was Asian American. This is ironic, as the monument was intended to remember soldiers who died in the war in Vietnam, a country in Asia. The memorial lacks the figurative ornamentation normally expected in memorials and is submerged in the ground instead of rising vertically.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Writing on the Wall<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artworks like Rivera\u2019s <strong><em>Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Park<\/em><\/strong> challenge societal restrictions and are commentaries on social injustice. These themes are continued in the <strong>Neo-Expressionist<\/strong> movement.<\/p>\n<p>Like the German Expressionists of the early 20th century, <strong>Neo-Expressionists portrayed recognizable objects, especially the human figure, in a violent and emotional<\/strong> way using vivid colors that had been rejected by previous art movements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jean-Michel Basquiat<\/strong> was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Haitian father and a Puerto Rican mother. His teenage years were marked by trouble, including his parents\u2019 divorce and a car accident that resulted in several injuries.<\/p>\n<p>He ran away from home at the age of 15 and dropped out of high school. His father disinherited him as a result, and he spent the rest of his teen years living on the streets of New York. His earliest involvement with the art world was as a street artist, but he soon moved from graffiti and subway art into a Neo-Expressionist style that sought to translate the images and experiences of black America to a high-art setting and audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2458\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/226-Horn-Players.jpg?resize=510%2C651&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"651\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Horn Players<\/em>. Jean-Michel Basquiat. 1983 C.E.

Basquiat represents the musicians with fractured figures and boldly colored graffiti-like words on a black background. This is suggestive of the rhythms of jazz music and the excitement of New York City. Horn Players challenged societal restrictions and the definition of art. Using jazz, which originated in African American communities, Basquiat connects societal symbols of black America for high-art audiences, underscoring the significant contributions of African American communities.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Revival<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>The prefix \u201cneo\u201d at the beginning of a word indicates a revival<\/strong> of or a new form of the word it precedes. In this case, it is both. <strong>Graffiti in Neo-Expressionism<\/strong> and Basquiat\u2019s work is a revival of Expressionism. It took the social commentary and expressed it with vivid colors in new ways and using graffiti as a platform. This then <strong>elevated graffiti as an art form<\/strong> and made it more accessible.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Untitled<\/em><\/strong> is a powerful pictographic landscape in which Basquiat creates a mythical landscape composed of stick-like figures amid mystical symbols and mysterious marks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2460\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?resize=719%2C482&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Untitled-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The black male figures wear crowns, a component of his tag as a street artist, representative of their dignity and power.<\/p>\n<p>He arms them with weapons, signifying that dignity and violence are complementary, a suggestion also made in the pictographic works of African tribal artists. Basquiat met Andy Warhol in 1982 and collaborated with him for several years after, resulting in a reciprocal boost to both careers, especially Warhol\u2019s.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Graffiti<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The use of <strong>graffiti has had a long and symbiotic relationship with degenerative, lowbrow art<\/strong>. The idea of painting or otherwise altering public property in the way street artists do is problematic in that it is technically illegal and is looked down on. However, the <strong>public and subversive nature of street art is part of its character<\/strong> and appeals to artists.<\/p>\n<p>Banksy, pseudonym of an anonymous British street artist, exemplifies the degree of public showmanship necessary in the graffiti-art tradition pioneered by Basquiat. Banksy has even been caught on security cameras hanging his own work in the Louvre, which people then believed was supposed to be there.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2462\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Graffiti-depicting-graffiti-removal-by-Banksy.jpg?resize=777%2C517&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Graffiti-depicting-graffiti-removal-by-Banksy.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Graffiti-depicting-graffiti-removal-by-Banksy.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Graffiti-depicting-graffiti-removal-by-Banksy.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Graffiti-depicting-graffiti-removal-by-Banksy.jpg?resize=666%2C444&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Graffiti depicting graffiti removal by Banksy<\/em>.

It is the same idea with the characters dancing. There are no rules against dancing at the Louvre.

The Guerrilla Girls, formed in New York in 1984, are <strong>a group of anonymous women<\/strong> who use the names of deceased women artists as pseudonyms and wear gorilla masks as they engage in \u201cguerrilla\u201d war tactics to call attention to inequalities in the art world related to race and sex. This reflects the attack on women resulting in them feeling as if they are at war with oppression.<\/p>\n<p>Very little is known about them. They are <strong>careful to maintain their anonymity<\/strong>, not disclosing their membership or location due to fear of retaliation from the art world they are part of and attacking their own context to promote change within it. In addition to <strong>promoting equality in art<\/strong>, the Guerrilla Girls tackle a number of <strong>feminist issues\u2014gender-based discrimination in the workplace, sexual abuse, and human rights.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The group, which is still active, has published five books since 1995. Their actions include performance, public lectures, and the use of fliers and posters, such as the ironic poster, The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist. The propagandistic poster sarcastically lists the advantages women artists have, including \u201cworking without the pressure of success,\u201d \u201cseeing your ideas live on in the work of others,\u201d and \u201cnot having to undergo the embarrassment of being called a genius.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2574\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Advantages-of-Being-a-Woman-Artist.-Acrylic-on-canvas-tie-dyed-pieced-fabric-border.jpg?resize=860%2C665&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"860\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Advantages-of-Being-a-Woman-Artist.-Acrylic-on-canvas-tie-dyed-pieced-fabric-border.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/The-Advantages-of-Being-a-Woman-Artist.-Acrylic-on-canvas-tie-dyed-pieced-fabric-border.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of Being a Woman Artist.

Young male volunteers posed in various masculine poses and were videoed, while older men were videoed discussing how machismo had shaped their lives. This emphasizes the lineage and generational connection that are brought out through the barbershop.<\/p>\n<p>A building was <strong>painted to resemble a Puerto Rican barbershop<\/strong>, and inside, video monitors with no sound presented the Latino male body engaged in physical displays of masculinity like lifting weights or specific walks, while monitors in the windows played continuous videos of men crying. The walls and chair were <strong>decorated in symbols of masculinity<\/strong> like Latino athletes and entertainers, pushing the viewer to address the cultural expectations of Latino men, where young boys are told not to cry, in a space where the female is not allowed.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Organic Portrayals<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A Polish sculptor and fiber artist, <strong>Magdalena Abakanowicz<\/strong> explores the expressive powers of weaving techniques, a mostly feminine art form, in large-scale artworks. Abakanowicz\u2019s sculptures reflect her early life experiences under Nazi rule.<\/p>\n<p>The change, dislocation, devastation, and poverty she experienced is conveyed in a large-scale, anonymous way so that anyone can see himself or herself in the work.<\/p>\n<p>The use of <strong>fiber materials is symbolic for Abakanowicz<\/strong>\u2014she views fiber as the basic element and building block of the organic world. Her work, Androgyne III, represents the torso, arms, and upper legs of a human body sitting on a wooden, ladder-like bench. It appears as a hollow shell and incomplete from the front, expressing the physical and spiritual condition of humanity and suggesting meditation, submission, and anticipation. The back is fully formed, representing the truth. The use of fiber shows the androgynous nature of the cellular makeup of the human body along with its connection to the earth.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast with Abakanowicz\u2019s <strong><em>Androgyne III<\/em><\/strong>, Wangechi Mutu\u2019s <strong><em>Preying Mantra<\/em><\/strong>, as seen in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description, portrays the human form camouflaged by nature. The title alludes to the praying mantis, a predator insect that is typically green or brown and utilizes camouflage to allow it to ambush its prey. The adult female praying mantis will often eat her mate just after or during mating. The African female body is portrayed with machine-like features, including a cyborg-like eye and un-humanlike skin that appears to reflect the environment, giving an illusion of oneness with nature portrayed not as connection, but as subversion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1233\" style=\"font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.0625rem;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/228-Androgyne-III.jpg?resize=503%2C629&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"503\" height=\"629\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/228-Androgyne-III.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/228-Androgyne-III.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\"><em>Androgyn III<\/em>.

His immigration coincided with events causing significant transformation of American culture: the construction of interstate highways, the popularization of television in homes, and the development of the first portable video camera. <strong>Paik pioneered the use of video as a primary medium the 1960s<\/strong>. Paik\u2019s use of video makes a statement about the importance of television in our culture.<\/p>\n<p>Paik employed <strong>music, performance, and video in many of his early works<\/strong>, arguing new technology would supersede painting and sculpture.<\/p>\n<p>Paik\u2019s sculptures\u2019 incorporation of television sets playing video images&#8211;as both a modus operandi for his preferred medium and a representation of television\u2019s place in popular culture&#8211; has continued in his body of work. <strong><em>Phiber Optik<\/em><\/strong> exemplifies a common theme in Paik\u2019s work, the melding of humanity and technology. A robot-like figure composed of television sets sits astride a motorcycle, combining traditional art with the new art that Paik pioneers. Unifying man and machine, <strong><em>Phiber Optik<\/em><\/strong> is a visual representation of one of the first teenage hackers, Mark Abene. <strong><em>Phiber Optik<\/em><\/strong> was Abene\u2019s handle and represented his online identity, and the work functions as a symbol of the blending of personas, one real and one digital.<\/p>\n<p>Paik\u2019s site-specific sculpture <strong><em>Electronic Superhighway<\/em><\/strong> can be seen in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description. It is a statement about the prevalence and power of the mixed messages transmitted by television in our society and the cultural connection formed by highways.<\/p>\n<p>The work is a neon outline map of the United States set against a wall of several computer-controlled video monitors. This neon references highway scenery and motel signs. Each monitor displays rapidly changing soundtracked images that reflect each state\u2019s culture and history, and in the case of New York, includes viewers in the work by showing their video image as they are viewing it. While Paik dismissed painting as pass\u00e9, his intention of involving the viewer in the work harks back to da Vinci\u2019s the <strong><em>Last Supper<\/em><\/strong> and di Bondone\u2019s <strong><em>Lamentation.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2579\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Phiber-Optik.-Nam-June-Paik.-1995-C.E.-Mixed-media..jpg?resize=467%2C770&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"770\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Phiber-Optik.-Nam-June-Paik.-1995-C.E.-Mixed-media..jpg?w=273&amp;ssl=1 273w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Phiber-Optik.-Nam-June-Paik.-1995-C.E.-Mixed-media..jpg?resize=182%2C300&amp;ssl=1 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Phiber Optik.

A nude male figure slowly emerges from the watery depths, breaks the water&#8217;s surface to draw a deep breath, and sinks back into the dark void. Each time he rises, his breath becomes a forceful primal sound of life that resonates in the space of the cathedral.<\/p>\n<p>Viola\u2019s use of nudity in his works symbolizes the pure state of the soul. Images of submersion and drowning, symbolic of baptism, draw on his own spiritual experience when nearly drowning. The piece is a slow and cyclical meditation on the elemental act of drawing breath, representing the cycle of life and death.<\/p>\n<p>The emergence of the figure from the water resembles rituals of spiritual rebirth found in many religious traditions.

Gelatin silver print.<\/p>\n<p>Sherman exemplifies both the relationship of male and female and that of contemporary and historical perspectives in her <strong><em>Untitled (#228)<\/em><\/strong>, from the History Portraits series, which can be viewed in the AP Art History Course and Exam Description. Here, Sherman portrays Judith from the Apocrypha, a portion of the Catholic Old Testament. Judith was an attractive Jewish widow who devised a strategy to save the city of Bethulia, her home, which was threatened by King Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s Assyrian army under the command of Holofernes. Judith seduced Holofernes while he was drunk and then decapitated him. When the Assyrian soldiers came to storm Bethulia, they retreated when they saw Holofernes\u2019s head.<\/p>\n<p>Sherman worked from the representations in paintings done in the style of Italian, French, and Northern European painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. The story of Judith returning with Holofernes\u2019s head has been represented in works by Sandro Botticellli and Cristofani Allori. Sherman\u2019s Judith has rich tapestries hung behind her, symbolizing the domestic expectations of women. She is clothed in a red robe with a black sash, reminiscent of the clothing represented in Botticelli\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to the traditional representations of Judith, the graphic nature of the beheading is represented in Sherman\u2019s by the knife and the blood-stained left hand. The head of Holofernes is in her right, represented by a wrinkled, grey, balding mask.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sherman\u2019s representation of Judith is significant<\/strong> as she is a historical figure who used her feminine nature and seduction to achieve a goal, exploiting herself. This is a departure from previous representations: The grotesque is representative of female interpretation of the subject as opposed to the male, sexualized version.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Off With Her Head<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>Yinka Shonibare<\/strong> is a British-Nigerian artist who considers himself biracial, being from both England and Nigeria. The artist expresses his frustration with the continual cultural push to classify a person as one race. His works, including <strong><em>The Swing (after Fragonard)<\/em><\/strong>, exemplify this duality and comment on the superficiality of race. Influenced by <strong><em>The Swing<\/em><\/strong> by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Shonibare\u2019s representation is a headless mannequin clothed in batik fabrics with African-inspired prints.

For Koons\u2019s supporters, and they are legion, this is an anti-tradition that has become an honorable tradition, with all that implies about the risks and rewards of legitimacy.

During this time, propaganda images depicted Chairman Mao as the sun and the mass of people as sunflowers turning toward him, and individuals were stripped of personal freedom.

Her work breaks down the barrier of skin to expose these parts that are usually kept hidden from view and from our own recognition of our real nature.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Ribs <\/em><\/strong>is a rib cage constructed out of terracotta, a delicate material that reiterates the concept of fragility, evoking a shudder from the viewer because it deals so coldly with carnal realities.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong><em>Lying with the Wolf<\/em><\/strong>, Smith strays from her previous portrayals of the female body and depicts a female nude reclining beside a wolf. The work is one in a series that explores women\u2019s relationships with animals using representations found in visual, literary, and oral histories. The woman is based on the fairy tale character Little Red Riding Hood and Saint Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris who was believed to have had a close relationship with animals and was able to domesticate wolves.<\/p>\n<p>The woman and wolf are depicted as at peace rather than as predator and prey, in an almost sexualized pose.

If they couldn\u2019t say it correctly, they were revealed as Ephraimites and killed. It is now used to mean a custom, principle, or belief that distinguishes a group of people.

The organic, sculptural structure also demonstrates the abilities of computer-assisted design with interconnecting, flowing spaces and dynamic curves.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1755\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?resize=767%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/240-Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The <strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts<\/strong> was also a result of computer-assisted design. The architect, <strong>Zaha Hadid<\/strong>, champions the use of pure colors and abstract geometric shapes to express feeling in creative art and harmony with the environment. Her goal is to evince an emotional effect from the viewer through unadorned planes in dynamic arrangements.<\/p>\n<p>The MAXXI is a composition of bending oblong tubes that overlap and intersect, and Hadid paid specific attention to the natural lighting by using thin concrete beams on the ceiling together with glass covering. Many facets of the exterior are reflective due to the glass covering used. Another example of <strong>Deconstructivism<\/strong>, the building was designed to provide a fluid interior without redundant wall divisions or interruptions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1760\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?resize=831%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"831\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?w=422&amp;ssl=1 422w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/medievalarthistory.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/249-MAXXI-National-Museum-of-XXI-Century-Arts.jpg?resize=300%2C119&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>MAXXI National Museum of XXI Century Arts.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Lesson Summary<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Artists like Nam June Paik and Bill Viola manipulated technology, like television and video, to create artworks that exemplify cultural and spiritual connections.
